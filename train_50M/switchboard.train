A:	Okay.
A:	So, What kind of experience do you, do you have, then with child care?
B:	I guess, I think, uh, I wonder if that worked.
A:	Does it say something?
B:	I think it usually does.
B:	You might try, uh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	hold it down a little longer,
B:	and see if it, uh,
A:	Okay
A:	Well, Does it usually make a recording or
B:	Okay
B:	I, Well, I don't remember.
B:	It seemed like it did,
B:	but it might not.
B:	I guess I guess we can start. Uh,
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	No,
B:	I don't, I don't have any kids.
B:	I, uh, my sister has a, she just had a baby,
B:	he's about five months old
B:	and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	do you have kids?
A:	I have three.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do
A:	Yes, uh,
A:	I don't work, though,
A:	but I used to work and, when I had two children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit,
A:	but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, does your sister live in a big community?
B:	Uh, yeah
B:	she lives,
B:	it's a, it's a fairly large community.
B:	She, uh, got real lucky, though.
B:	He had a boss who, uh, moved into a larger office
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she's able to take her baby to work with her.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And it's a small office that she works in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office,
B:	and it's just one lawyer
A:	Um.
B:	and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office.
B:	There's no one else that works there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby,
B:	so it works out pretty good for her.
A:	Wow.
A:	How lucky
A:	I, I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, but, the community I'm in is not a real large one,
A:	so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, you know,
A:	you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so it's fairly safe.
A:	Yeah,
A:	to get references and that,
A:	so, but, uh,
A:	I, I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply because there's so many kids and so many
B:	Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, you know, colds and things like that get spread real easy and things,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, and they're expensive
A:	and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things.
B:	Yes.
A:	Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that,
A:	but,
A:	take a long time to find the right place
B:	Yeah,
B:	and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the right place or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Anything, I guess, could happen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because after, I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	when he starts toddling around and stuff.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him
B:	and he starts crawling
B:	that's,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It would be hard,
A:	I think it would be kind of stressful.
A:	It would be nice to have him around
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, seems like, you know,
A:	what if he cried at the wrong time
A:	or the phone rang or, you know, at the wrong time
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	I think she has problems with that, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, when you have kids, will you work?
A:	Do you work now?
B:	I don't know
B:	that's something I've considered. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that what you do?
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Actually, I teach my kids at home,
A:	so I'm here all the time.
B:	Oh, so they don't go to school.
B:	Is it like, uh,
B:	oh, what's that called,
B:	it's, uh, correspondence school,
B:	they do it at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	That's interesting.
A:	So,
B:	Do you have to have any special training?
A:	Not,
A:	it depends on the state you live actually.
A:	Some laws absolutely prohibit it.
A:	Some states, uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that.
A:	Our state doesn't yet, say that
A:	and I'm not a certified teacher.
A:	I went to college,
A:	but I, you know, but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now
A:	and so,
B:	So they haven't been to public schools at all.
A:	One of them was for a couple of years
A:	and so, you know, my oldest, he was,
A:	and then my youngest two have never been.
B:	Um.
A:	So anyway,
A:	but we don't,
B:	So, you've never had,
A:	Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?
B:	Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,
B:	because when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that,
B:	but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.
A:	Huh.
B:	How about you?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh,
A:	our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it says, use of narcotics on company premises.
B:	Um.
A:	So that's pretty general,
A:	but, uh, I work for an environmental management firm
B:	Okay.
A:	and I'm an engineer there,
A:	but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,
A:	but I don't operate any machinery.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because they're at a higher risk of exposure
A:	and blood screening is part of that
A:	and I, I think that drugs,
A:	they do test for drugs in that capacity,
A:	but it's not their exclusive,
A:	it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.
A:	What is the nature of your company's business?
B:	Well, it's actually, uh,
B:	we do oil well services.
B:	So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,
B:	and they go out to,
B:	we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,
B:	so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,
B:	but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and, a software engineer
A:	Um.
B:	and I work in the software, uh, house,
B:	and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.
B:	They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,
B:	and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, all the engineers have to, to,
B:	well, a little different, actually,
B:	but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing,
B:	and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, I guess than than a lot of drug policies.
B:	In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,
B:	and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,
B:	but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.
B:	Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,
B:	and they didn't find any problem with that, you know,
B:	but,
A:	Right.
B:	Uh,
A:	We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.
A:	they'll have these little parties,
A:	and people will just get,
A:	I mean, I've,
A:	my brother lives where I work,
A:	and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know.
A:	And, uh, uh, but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh, I think drug testing,
A:	and I, I don't know,
A:	I guess I I think it's got some relevance,
A:	but I think its relevance is pretty limited.
A:	I mean, I think, you know,
A:	in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really, it's really bizarre.
B:	Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know.
B:	I, I,
B:	there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle
B:	and she, she was a personnel secretary
B:	and she had to get tested
B:	and, I don't know
B:	I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.
B:	I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know,
B:	they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense
B:	and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test
B:	and, and it's, it was kind of a long story,
B:	but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,
B:	and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews,
B:	I'm not even working for this company,
B:	I'm going in for, like, interviews
B:	and they flew me out to Chicago
B:	and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.
B:	They said it was going to be a physical, you know,
B:	and, uh, actually beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening,
B:	but I had forgotten about that,
B:	and so, basically, I'd already peed off that morning
B:	and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample,
B:	and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,
A:	Oh.
A:	Right.
B:	and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.
B:	You go in there with the doctor,
B:	he makes you take off all your clothes
B:	and then he examines you.
A:	Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget.
A:	The only thing I do now is, uh, put the data into Quicken.
A:	I don't know if you are familiar with that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have some friends of mine who use Quicken
B:	and, uh, I've considered using it once myself,
B:	but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I, I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now.
A:	Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, uh, uh, not bother to total it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.
A:	So it really helps with that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, it's similar problems
B:	but, uh, we just have the one check book
B:	and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible
B:	and occasionally we will get behind like you say
B:	but, uh, it doesn't really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up to date and balanced.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances?
A:	Well, actually we haven't had to. Uh, until just recently.
A:	I guess we've got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way
A:	so we needed to start doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for college and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We tried a way, try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well that's pretty good if you can do that.
B:	I know.
B:	I have a daughter who's ten
B:	and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point
B:	but, uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
A:	Um.
B:	and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund.
A:	Um. Sounds good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess we're, we're just at the point, uh,
A:	my wife worked until we had a family
A:	and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income
A:	so it's a lot more interesting trying to, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, uh, do it.
A:	You know, kind of enforce the savings.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, it will be interesting to see
B:	Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job, well almost full time.
A:	Um.
B:	So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, uh, long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing.
A:	Um.
A:	That sounds good.
A:	But, uh, uh, I was just curious, what, uh, part of the country.
B:	Oh, Stockton.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	How about you?
A:	Uh, Cincinnati, actually.
A:	I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that.
A:	I don't know how many people are, uh, getting involved in this
A:	but uh, well that's interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST
A:	or was there another?
B:	Uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called INTERNET.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is how I got it as well
A:	but, uh,
B:	And he just forwarded that on to me
B:	and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I sent back mail.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it will be interesting to see what, It would be interesting to see how the data base,
A:	so, well, I guess we're talking about the experiment.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic
A:	but, uh, it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to, uh, dollar figures I guess you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we could talk about some of the long range goals
A:	and,
B:	Well what other long range goals do you have besides college?
A:	Uh, well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that.
A:	It seems like every year my employer just gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
A:	and now it's, uh, now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
A:	and, uh, it's a real shame from what we had before, uh, because we're,
A:	Right,
A:	uh, actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years,
A:	I lived in Germany
A:	and in Germany they don't have the jury system.
A:	What they do is they have, uh, three judges, basically.
A:	And you get up there
A:	and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
A:	and your defense attorney presents their evidence
A:	and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.
B:	our judicial system is in such total chaos.
B:	I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow take the money out of it.
B:	I mean, when you have a man that's signed a, a, a statement saying he's guilty,
B:	we have a, a family called All day family.
B:	They were all murdered.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	All the people signed confessions,
B:	they went to a trial by jury.
B:	They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child.
A:	Wow.
B:	And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,
B:	has nothing to do with justice whatsoever.
A:	Well, you know, it's, it's one of those things,
A:	I mean, uh, uh, I would have to look at it.
A:	if they did it with the, uh, just the judges, the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
A:	because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures,
A:	they know what's good and what isn't,
A:	they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,
A:	you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
A:	and, you know, you wouldn't have this, uh, uh, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the, to the jury
A:	and then the judge says, oh, no,
A:	disregard that.
A:	Come on,
A:	any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, you know
B:	Uh, that's true.
B:	I, I, I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself.
A:	That may very well be.
B:	I, I hold it in the utmost contempt.
A:	Uh,
B:	The, uh, my favorite is the police department,
B:	they're not aimed at the criminal.
B:	The judicial system is aimed at the citizens
B:	because you and I, we have work schedules,
B:	we can be called at work,
B:	we have Social Security numbers,
B:	they can trace us down,
B:	we have telephones,
B:	then we have checkbooks.
B:	Criminals have none of these things.
B:	They're real difficult to catch,
B:	and if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas us, we write a check.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So where do you think they target their efforts?
A:	That's true.
B:	They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals.
A:	Well, How would you go about changing it?
B:	You know, that's a,
B:	I've nailed the problem down
B:	but I,
A:	Leave the details up to somebody else, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about,
B:	I think, to begin with, you would you would have,
B:	like, here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,
B:	yet, you go out on the streets
B:	and they're giving speeding tickets.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,
A:	Well, you know, uh, talking about the lawyers, you know what might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases.
A:	It's kind of like do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, V C R or television repair.
A:	If you take your T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, well, I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars,
A:	and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.
A:	He, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars.
A:	Now, if he comes in and says, you know, I'll repair your, your V C R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there,
A:	maybe it's a blown fuse,
A:	takes him two minutes,
A:	he fixes it,
A:	he still charges you that hundred dollars.
A:	So, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get X dollars for that case
A:	and that's it.
B:	Now, I firmly believe in that
A:	None of this,
B:	because when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And here's this bum that didn't have a job
A:	Yeah.
B:	and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford.
A:	That's true.
B:	Who's paying for that?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um, well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that's paying for that
B:	Yeah,
B:	and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
A:	That's right.
A:	You know that's, it, it's, it's amazing
A:	and, and when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, they're all former lawyers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's another problem.
B:	I think to really correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyers out of it
B:	I mean, they're, they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever,
B:	and with that type person running it, I mean, you, you could expect that you,
A:	Do you know anyone that, uh, is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?
B:	No.
B:	But I, my grandparents were looking into it before
B:	so I know what they've said.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I'm trying to think.
A:	My, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's
A:	and they were going to put her into a, a nursing home
A:	and, uh, they, when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble
A:	and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance,
A:	I mean  she sort of went, you know, bananas
B:	they thought it was too much of a bother.
A:	and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her
A:	So, I guess you need to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether
B:	Right.
B:	If they're equipped too, to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know, put in there too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.
A:	Right.
B:	They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
B:	but they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room.
A:	Right.
A:	My grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,
A:	there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,
A:	there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
A:	so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could, could also go and eat someplace else.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then, uh, as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, uh, provide full-time care
A:	and, uh, she didn't have to do anything anymore.
A:	But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.
A:	And that's
A:	I don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is.
A:	But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something.
B:	Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They need health care
B:	so they're already ill before they go.
A:	Right.
B:	That's probably a large factor.
A:	Yeah.
A:	If, if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are.
A:	Then you only go there as a last resort.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or people send you there as a last resort.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	That's what my grandparents,
B:	it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that was their thinking.
B:	Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency.
A:	Right.
B:	And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time.
A:	Right.
B:	I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess.
B:	That, uh,
B:	you can't always get in when you want too
B:	and of course, you can't just sit around and wait.
A:	Right.
A:	When you need it, you need it  I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it.
A:	Right.
B:	At that stage of life you only have so much money left
B:	and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean it is kind of fair,
B:	but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise.
A:	Sure.
B:	So it's another problem.
A:	And you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	So, it, it's just so complicated anymore, I think
B:	People outlive their savings.
B:	And, with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
B:	and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing.
B:	It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.
B:	I think  the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
A:	Yeah.
B:	and cause like if your spouse died, all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. To have friends.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've known quite a few people that have, uh, gone to retirement communities.
A:	I don't know if they have them back there
A:	but here in California and in
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, so, what do you think, uh, about putting the elderly in a nursing home?
B:	Well, I think that it, it varies on on the individual basis.
A:	Huh.
B:	Uh, sometimes it is, there is no alternative.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that's, uh,
B:	you may not even have family that is, uh, uh, in, you know, who are around.
A:	That's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, sometimes it's not an alternative.
A:	Huh
B:	And I think, uh, but I think also, sometimes it can be, uh, a benefit if it's for a short time.
B:	Sometimes in a nursing home
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, especially if, if it's after an acute illness.
B:	To get over a,
B:	or to rehab after, uh, an illness.
A:	That's true.
A:	I never thought of that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Sometimes you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just short periods of time.
A:	That's true,
A:	until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because too often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to.
A:	Yes.
A:	They really are.
A:	They don't like to keep them longer than a week.
B:	So so there is some good to it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job.
B:	You know the well the families do not necessarily uh, know what to do with them
A:	What do you mean?
B:	and they don't want to take the responsibility
B:	so they will put them in a nursing home.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	So you see, uh,
B:	there's both sides to it too.
B:	What do you think?
A:	Yeah
A:	and it depends on how, how sick the person is too. What you're capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, I would personally like it
A:	if my parents were to get ill, I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help.
A:	That's not always possible.
B:	That's true.
A:	But, uh, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible
B:	I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to,
B:	it's there's not a choice, it's  because, it's not economically feasible even to  put them in a nursing home.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either Medicare or insurance to cover it.
A:	That's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	But I think nursing homes can be good.
A:	It just depends on what kind they are.
A:	You know, you need to check them out ahead of time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then there's also some that are set up for specialties
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, I know some.
B:	Unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, I guess it's Alzheimer's or where  they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that they're
B:	And you need a special nursing home for that.
B:	You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you need people who are trained for that type  of problem.
A:	Right.
A:	Who know what they're doing with that.
B:	Yeah
B:	so, so there's different types of nursing homes I think.
A:	Yeah
A:	well, my, uh, grandmother's not really in a nursing home, but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it.
A:	And she really liked the idea of, of moving there.
A:	She's not ill yet
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
A:	and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually, you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden.
A:	She's very independent.
A:	So she's in this nursing home.
A:	It's out in the country
A:	and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook
B:	Gives her a little bit of her own independence
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but she still has, uh, a security there.
A:	Right.
A:	Some support.
A:	And then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
A:	and, what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
A:	and then, so if she ever does become ill, uh, it will be like family around her.
B:	That's right
B:	and I  I've seen some of them like that too
A:	Yeah.
B:	and also they have a lot of, uh, activities going on for the ones  who are more active.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah.
B:	So it's not sort of like, uh, uh  a sick place.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	No,
A:	she loves it.
A:	She has a great social life
A:	and she travels
A:	and, uh, it's in, in the in the mountains
A:	and it's beautiful
A:	and, uh, I, I hope that I have something like that when I get older
B:	Yeah
B:	I, I think, I think the, uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly uh, person who's going in and the family that's going to be, uh, effected by it
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh definitely it's,
B:	and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those those choices can be made in advance
B:	and sometimes  the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're,
A:	Right.
A:	So, uh, do you happen to be working for a large firm?
B:	Well, it's about three hundred and fifty people.
B:	I guess that's not large compared to some,
B:	but it's big enough.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they have a, they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
B:	and I wish they did.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, they have a four O one K,
B:	but I put all the money into it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They don't add anything.
B:	What about you?
A:	Uh, I work for a fairly large company.
A:	It's got eight thousand people.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we do have health insurance.
A:	We don't have four O one K plan, stuff like that,
A:	but we do have, like, retirement.
A:	They kind of match up to, you,
A:	if you put six percent, they match up to six percent,
A:	and then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that.
B:	Oh, that's a pretty good deal.
A:	It's not bad.
B:	Now, how long does it take for your contribution to vest?
A:	God, I don't know.
A:	It's probably a long time
A:	I'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years, thirty years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive.
B:	It's like hundred bucks a, a month or something for a family.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Huh, well, I guess what we have is like a what they call a flex benefits plan where you, you get like a certain amount of dollars
A:	and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need.
A:	Otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, you know, put in your paycheck.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, uh, they'll basically pay for, uh, you know, child care type, uh, expenses.
B:	I can send in a, uh, can send in a request for payment
B:	and they'll, uh, and they'll send me, a check for the amount they withheld.
B:	That's pretty good, you know.
B:	It's, uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something.
A:	Yeah
A:	well, it depends on which company you work for.
A:	I know that, like, the, the, the one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, uh, you know, you, uh, think you call it plan D
A:	another example like I guess it's alzheimer's Deductibles are really high,
A:	it's like fifteen hundred dollars,
A:	but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely, if you're relatively, uh, healthy, then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much, amount of money, you know.
A:	So, it, someone did start a cost benefit analysis,
A:	and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and, and take a loss, whatever happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess,
B:	uh, on the other hand, you know, I, I had a similar, had a similar health plan
B:	and, uh, one of my kids was in a car accident
B:	and, uh I had, wound up having to pay for, you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, you know, no, no insurance policy happened to cover it, which is,
A:	Um.
A:	Really?
A:	You mean, not even your, your, your car insurance?
B:	Well, it, it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here,
B:	and, and I had a high deductible on the on the, uh, on the car insurance
B:	and then you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it
A:	Oh, that's too bad.
B:	Oh, well.
A:	Yeah
A:	uh, well, I don't know,
A:	I think other than health insurance, I think, uh, you know, an extra week of, uh, time off would be nice.
A:	I only get two weeks.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	my place you get two weeks when you start
B:	and then every, every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks.
A:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	We don't get them till, till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week.
B:	Aye.
B:	That's a long time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in, you know, companies don't stay afloat that long
B:	and, and they,
A:	Uh, with the telecommunications type of company, supposedly you, used to be much more stable.
A:	It's a lot less stable than it used to be.
A:	They used to have job security
A:	but now they don't.
B:	So you work for Bell or something like that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's the Bell Corps, which is, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I don't know,
A:	it's, it's, uh, no longer
A:	So that's what,
A:	I think it's still based on the old model of,
A:	and, and now they don't, uh,
B:	A lifelong job security
B:	telephone pioneers of America,
A:	Yeah.
B:	all that stuff, huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but they, no, no longer
A:	I don't think so.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, hearing a
A:	there's always, they're always laying people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security.
B:	Is it, I mean, does it,
B:	they must have pretty good severance, though, huh?
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	we don't, we haven't been doing layoffs.
A:	We've been doing, uh, down sizing with, uh, getting rid of extra layers of management.
A:	And, uh, I don't know what they do for those people.
B:	Mean the, the, the management they get rid of?
A:	Some of it,
A:	yeah.
B:	Um.
A:	There's too many manage, too many chiefs and not enough Indians
A:	but,
B:	Oh, they, they put,
A:	Well, have you ever served on a jury?
B:	No,
B:	I've not.
B:	I've been called,
B:	but I had to beg off from the duty.
B:	And you?
A:	Well, I was called
A:	and then I was not chosen.
B:	Um.
B:	Well, I was, I was, uh, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow
B:	and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.
B:	I don't know why.
B:	Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,
B:	and they kind of liked me.
B:	I looked and all that stuff
B:	and they,
B:	I don't know what they saw in me,
B:	but they saw it.
B:	But, uh, back to the issue, is, uh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun.
B:	But, there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases.
B:	In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unanimity remain,
B:	but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient.
A:	Well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?
B:	Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.
B:	And in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.
B:	A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases.
B:	I don't know if I'm making any sense or not.
A:	Well, I mean, I think,
A:	are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	often there's more incriminating evidence.
B:	Like, for instance, say, uh,
B:	and also, too, I think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case.
A:	Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?
B:	Um, well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known.
B:	Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a uh, civil and criminal case.
B:	I mean, the, uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that.
B:	You know, I don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not.
A:	No,
A:	I'm not.
B:	A, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death.
B:	Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked
B:	and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system.
B:	The case was reopened
B:	and he was exonerated.
A:	Well, I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served.
B:	Yeah,
B:	many laws, but little justice.
A:	Say,
A:	but, uh,
A:	and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective.
B:	Oh, certainly not,
B:	certainly not.
B:	And you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,
B:	but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.
B:	You know, the,
B:	because you get up
B:	and, and they ask you a few questions,
B:	both sides do,
B:	and then you, you're either challenged which is,
B:	you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like
B:	or, I think it's a limit now,
B:	they probably have a limit now,
B:	but, they pretty much go through that,
B:	and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.
B:	For me, it was financial hardship,
B:	so. But, onto the thing, uh, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing.
B:	It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say.
A:	Okay,
A:	so I guess it starts recording now.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	I don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in.
A:	We live in the Saginaw area.
B:	Saginaw?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that,
A:	I,
A:	fact as far as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And, uh, or the grocery store or anything in this area,
B:	Really?
A:	yeah.
B:	The
B:	we live in Plano
B:	and they started off recycling by, uh, putting the,
B:	I think at each Wal-Mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which now,
B:	I guess the, uh, city is, has bought the big green trash cans
B:	and, uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now
B:	and you separate your glass and paper and, uh, aluminum
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you set it out
B:	and they pick it up
B:	and it, it works real neat.
B:	They seem to be having a real good response.
A:	Really?
B:	So,
A:	That is pretty good.
A:	I'm, we're originally from another state
A:	and I know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing.
A:	The city brought ought, you know, set separate trash cans
A:	and you separated your stuff
A:	and you put it in there
A:	and they took it, you know.
B:	Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back for for cans
A:	I don't really know.
A:	I don't really know,
A:	they, they started after we moved down here
A:	and so I, I'm not really familiar.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just know that, uh, my in-laws up in, up in Oklahoma, that's how they do, you know, they pick it up,
A:	but I don't know if they get a, get anything back on it
A:	or, do you get money for it?
B:	No,
B:	I just, I noticed it
B:	Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can.
A:	Oh.
B:	So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles.
A:	Really
B:	You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, I guess when you purchase them and, and then when you turn them back in.
A:	Right.
B:	I I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel.
A:	Right.
A:	And now, now most of them are throwaway.
B:	Right.
B:	So, maybe that's one thing they can do.
A:	I think now they're a lot more expensive than that.
A:	Uh, I bought some Cokes the other day in the the little bottles you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think the bottles were like, I know they were at least ten cents apiece.
A:	I to at home,
A:	I was like, God, how much were those bottles you know?
B:	Yes.
A:	And, it was, they come in like, uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, you know instead of six packs
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, and they were like, it was like two dollars and something for the bottles.
A:	You know, I was like God Almighty,
A:	it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes.
B:	That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.
B:	He was in the bottle area
A:	In the
B:	It's pretty dangerous out there, you know, when they fall over,
B:	but but it's, uh, it's quite,
A:	Right.
B:	they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass,
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Of green glass.
B:	yeah.
B:	It's amazing.
A:	Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything.
A:	Now, I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	but I, I do know some of these places were doing that
A:	and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah
B:	it's,
B:	I notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It, it's,
B:	people just,
B:	they, they really don't,
B:	uh, there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff.
A:	Yeah,
A:	more than it's worth.
B:	It's,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it, it can be,
B:	it's not as easy selecting, you know, clean junk as they say.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
B:	It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher.
A:	Right,
A:	uh, yeah.
B:	We all do it
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	It was nice talking to you.
A:	I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything.
B:	Oh, I think, I think two or three minutes is fine.
A:	Is that it?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, it was nice talking to you
A:	and I, I guess I'll do this for, I was doing this for, actually, I was going to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but then it has my name on it,
A:	so I'm like, okay,
A:	I'll sit down here and call it
B:	Well, we're doing it for a church choir
B:	so,
A:	Oh, are you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
B:	So,
A:	That's nice.
A:	Well,
B:	Well, thank you.
A:	Thank you.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	So. Have you heard about Saturns?
B:	seems to be out of I've heard some about Saturns.
B:	I don't know a lot about them.
B:	I haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, I guess, the Japanese cars.
A:	Ooh, that's great.
A:	Actually that's kind of the type of car that I, I'm thinking about we might get.
A:	Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a Saturn dealer. This, this offshoot of G M
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard.
B:	Um. Yeah,
B:	I've heard a lot of people like them.
B:	Uh, yet I don't know whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point.
B:	I'm kind of,
B:	my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky
B:	and so, uh.
A:	Well, like what?
B:	Well, let's see.
B:	I I like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,
B:	and that's not just the driver and the passenger
B:	but that's the person who's working on it,
B:	cause I do almost all my own maintenance and, uh  those types of things.
B:	And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very it's not very,
B:	almost unlikely at this point.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've got a sixty-five Mustang
A:	and  I, and I do the work on, most of the work on that myself.
B:	Ooh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that, I just say I will never do that with the modern cars.
A:	It's not worth my time.
A:	You can't get in there.
A:	You can't do anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's so complicated too.
A:	I look at it
A:	and I say, boy, you know,
A:	I, I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that.
B:	Well I've got an eighty-three Saab.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. It's really very easy to work on
B:	and so, uh, you know, I'm kind of spoiled.
B:	I used to have a Chevy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	With a three fifty in it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I really liked working on it. Uh, cause it was pretty easy too.
B:	It was about a nineteen seventy.
B:	So I'm kind of, uh, biased in that
B:	and, you know, I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore.
A:	Yeah
B:	And that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at.
B:	I think another thing I'd look at is safety.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about.
A:	Actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual  side air bags.
B:	Huh.
B:	That's a real nice car, I think.
A:	Yeah
B:	I've driven some, uh, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. Uh, as rental cars.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus.
B:	It's a really nice car.
B:	I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out.
B:	It's comfortable to drive.
B:	Uh, reasonable performance,
B:	and this is out in California where, where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I've been real impressed with that.
B:	and I didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now.
A:	Ninety,
A:	yeah.
A:	Or, excuse me, the ninety-twos.
A:	The  ninety-twos had dual air bags.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	This newest model.
A:	You could  get them with duals
B:	I think  That's excellent.
B:	That's excellent because,
A:	Yeah.
A:	But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars.
A:	Actually, my, my wife and I are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so.
A:	So we're actually  been looking around and thinking about things.
B:	Oh.
A:	We'd like to get like a
A:	oh, I don't know.
A:	What do you call it?
A:	A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Year old ninety-two or something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
B:	Those are
A:	See if we,
B:	yeah,
B:	that, that would be a good deal to go with.
A:	And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too.
B:	Okay.
A:	Because they looked really nice.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you, what do you looking for in, in those?
B:	What, what attracts you to the Saturns?
B:	Or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know,
B:	the Taurus is safe.
B:	But what kind of things are you looking for?
A:	Well, the Saturns you can get air bags in them.
A:	I don't think you can get dual side air bags.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But one of the, the two things that I'm really,
A:	the, the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You set down.
A:	You look at consumer reports.
A:	We've been pouring over consumer reports
A:	and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
A:	and, and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the other one is, are the Saturns.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So those two things.
A:	And then, you know, we kind of want a four door.
B:	Okay
A:	Okay.
A:	What is your, uh, community, uh, currently doing with regard to recycling?
B:	Uh, basically, they're just, uh, having various recycling, uh, bins, uh, located for, uh, trash pickup.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts.
A:	Some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect
A:	and they do have bins set up.
A:	But I live in a, a metropolitan area
A:	and, uh, they're not, uh, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
B:	Well, here they and,
B:	uh, live in an apartment complex.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.
B:	So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, you know, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins.
A:	I, I know a lot, I think a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have to be motivated to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.
A:	Whether
A:	and, and I think that, and I know Massachusetts has,
A:	a bottle bill was passed
A:	and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now,
A:	and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,
A:	that's the majority of people that I know of anyways.
A:	Where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do.
A:	And I'm not going to throw a bottle away,
A:	it's like throwing a nickel away.
A:	That type of thing.
B:	Right.
B:	They,  here they're trying to push through a bill
A:	But, uh, people need to be more conscious of it.
B:	and a lot of people are against it.
B:	And it's going to create a lot more work for the, uh, the stores that sell, you know, sodas and stuff.
B:	Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything.
A:	Yeah
A:	It didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans.
A:	Uh, and, and matter of fact, I think it took like three tries for it to go through.
A:	But, and it's been pretty successful
A:	and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know,
A:	people would have a drink of soda,
A:	instead of throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle
A:	so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth.
A:	But more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing.
A:	And that's the big thing, I think, that they try to promote.
B:	Right.
B:	I think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may  encourage people to separate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good idea.
A:	Yeah.
A:	there definitely has to be a motivation factor
A:	and I know that, at where I work,
A:	I work for a defense contractor.
A:	And there's a big push on for recycling, uh, paper materials, you know, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, uh, Styrofoam usage because of the, uh, the process involved in Styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that.
A:	And, and they're very proactive
A:	and, uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, uh, china wear rather than, uh, Styrofoam stuff,
A:	so. So, it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it.
A:	I think that's, that's what they need to do. Be more like that.
B:	Uh, I know, uh, I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books.
B:	Uh, usually have them come from you know, projects to collect old ones.
B:	Usually just get dumped out with the trash.
B:	And phone books are a large volume of annual trash.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They, they just,
A:	matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article I saw in the
A:	the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school
A:	and what they'll do is they'll recycle it.
A:	Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time.
A:	A guy went to a a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
A:	because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time.
B:	Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They contain the glue and stuff
B:	and they used to have to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now I think they've come up with some way of, uh, pulling the glue out.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Okay
A:	Uh, let's see.
A:	How about, uh, let's see, about ten years ago,
A:	uh, what do you think was different ten years ago from now?
B:	Well, I would say as, far as social changes go, uh, I think families were more together.
B:	They, they did more things together.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh, they ate dinner at the table together.
B:	Uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, although I'm not a mother, I, I still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago.
B:	Uh, what do you  think about that?
A:	We,
A:	Well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but I do agree that, uh, generally it's, society has sort of, uh, let's see, rushed everything ahead.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I don't know,
A:	it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that.
A:	In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently.
A:	But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation.
B:	Yes.
B:	What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?
B:	Do  you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago?
A:	Uh,
A:	Um. It depends.
A:	Uh, it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I just
B:	Well, how, how old are you?
A:	I'm twenty-eight.
B:	Twenty-eight.
B:	Okay,
B:	I'm twenty-three.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So there's maybe a five year gap between us.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh.
A:	I just, I think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along.
A:	It's just  a matter where priorities are, at placed. And that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home.
B:	Huh
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most places for both parents to work.
B:	Do you think it's an economic necessity
B:	or do you think that we're, we're, uh, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living?
A:	I think that's part of it too.
A:	But I do think,
B:	I mean do you think, people really need two cars and  a house in the suburbs or,
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	I don't.
A:	No,
A:	I don't think that.
A:	But then there are a lot of people that, that don't have that. But, that really do need to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think maybe those people that really do need to work, both parents, just to survive.
A:	And  then there, is, is that other group that is  working to maintain a standard of living that, uh, they think is, is surviving which is really more luxuries.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive.
B:	so you think it's,
B:	which group are you saying is the one trying?
A:	I'm saying that the, uh, the group that is just trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working is more of the majority than the, than the people that have the higher standard of living.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country I think that that's, in my opinion, the case.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
A:	So.
A:	I mean I have met people that, uh, both that, that just want to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that really need the job.
B:	Okay.
B:	And then, sometimes I, I often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. a microwave, a V C R, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	well I guess we're sticking more to social changes
B:	but, uh people want all of that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and not all of those are necessities.
A:	Right
B:	So they're trying to,
B:	it has become a necessity
A:	Okay.
B:	I say they, uh,
B:	probably the best things to do is, is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
B:	they  they're innocent right.
A:	I see.
A:	A  a good, a good southern solution.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, so, uh, how do you, how do you feel?
B:	that's, of course, being facetious
B:	but
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You'd have to say that.
A:	Uh, I don't know.
A:	The, the things they asked to talk about were whether the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that does the, uh, sentencing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And seems to me that that's, I think that's the way it's done now.
A:	Uh, at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it
A:	and I, I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is for a particular thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, I guess, also what the system will absorb
A:	Right.
B:	Probably more tuned in to that.
B:	Possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,
B:	I mean he could have like a personal prejudice.
B:	You know, judges are people like everybody else  even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial
A:	That's right.
B:	but maybe, uh,
A:	And I think that may, I, that may be an exception as well.
A:	Because I think that,
A:	doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than, than the judge?
B:	I, I think that's, I think that's the way it is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty.
B:	Do they have a death penalty in California?
A:	Yes.
A:	In  fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, there's a big uproar going on right now. Uh
B:	Yeah.
A:	the, uh, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, it's someone who had, uh, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I,
B:	something like that, I've got no problem with it. Uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess the way I think about it is not, it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge.
B:	It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	put it to sleep, you know.
B:	Just get it out, you know,
B:	it's not able to fit in, you know
A:	Something inexpensive.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly
B:	Uh, I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just,
B:	if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty,
B:	they got the death penalty,
B:	they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal
B:	and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that,
A:	But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
A:	and  you'd hate to be one of those.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, I'm sure
B:	Yeah.
A:	The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all the, all verdicts,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well maybe not.
A:	I don't know.
A:	At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be  unanimous.
B:	I believe it is  in capital.
B:	I think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever How ever many is on, sitting on a jury.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I I believe that's the way it is.
B:	But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh
A:	Yeah.
A:	The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other eleven.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something
A:	and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.
B:	Oh, no
A:	the judge told them  they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet
B:	I'm telling you, go one way or the other.
B:	That, that's probably an expensive trial.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Six months so far they said.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Probably.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Probably.
B:	You know, I'm not sure there's a number.
B:	It's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all.
A:	Maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, uh, vote.
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	That has been going on
B:	My, uh, cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami.
A:	Oh really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	So she follows that stuff pretty closely.
B:	But, uh,
A:	That's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	she's not involved in that, that case.
B:	But she does,
A:	Well have you ever served on a jury?
B:	No
B:	I haven't.
B:	I never have.
B:	My wife has
B:	but I, I haven't.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I got called
A:	but I, uh, never, uh, got selected for a jury
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they had some guy that was, uh, defending himself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye to someone speaking to
B:	So we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly?
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
A:	You know, what, what, uh, what do you think is important?
A:	If you were,
A:	uh, I don't know how, how old you are,
A:	but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or grandparents, whatever it is, uh, who were ready, who, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for?
B:	Uh, well I, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety
B:	and  he lives by himself
A:	Huh.
B:	and he's in good shape.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.
B:	I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and, uh, where they did some things to try to keep them, um, mentally alive. And where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do  you have any experience with this yourself?
A:	Huh.
A:	Well my, uh, uh, my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in, uh, Minnesota
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we go there, uh, once a year.
A:	We see, we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston
A:	so we're pretty far away.
A:	When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it seems, uh,
A:	I mean the, the environment there, I don't know too much about it
A:	but it, it seems nice enough.
A:	Uh, it, it's hard,
A:	at least half of the residents I would say are not, not mentally sound.
A:	So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, know
B:	From the lack of stimulation, you mean.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I I don't know.
A:	We, we also, my wife and I, uh, uh, volunteer to go to a, uh, nursing home that's just a mile from our house.
A:	We, uh, she goes more often than I.
A:	We used to go once a month, once every two months to visit some of the patients there.
A:	And we'd take, we have a two year old son
A:	and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.
A:	And, uh, there I would say it's the same thing.
A:	It's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment
A:	but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who are, who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on.
A:	It's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, and see all these other people who really don't know where they are.
B:	Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?
A:	I think, yeah,
A:	I think they're relatively respectful. Yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be.
A:	I, I think sometimes, you know, I've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things, uh, just repetitively and, but things that are not reasonable,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so  at some level the, the, the, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm sure that the, that the, uh, the staff learn what's normal for this person
A:	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, it's possible,
B:	I was thinking also that there'd be, there could be a fair burn out factor um, in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'll tell you one thing though that'll, that, that I, I saw that was really nice.
A:	We saw a husband and wife,
A:	we used to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together
A:	and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
A:	but these two were.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it  gives them a sense of identity.
A:	And so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you walked in there
A:	and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, you, you walk into some rooms
A:	and there's, it's completely generic.
A:	There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person
A:	and that's it.
A:	But this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that
A:	and they had all their stuff from their house
A:	and it looked like, uh, it must have been,
A:	it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them
A:	and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read.
B:	I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who, uh, were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh  physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide, um, a lot of social activities.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, the, one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
B:	and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation.
B:	Uh, and,
A:	Huh.
A:	temporary.
A:	I,
A:	that, that's, that's new to me.
A:	I,
B:	Well I think it, I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
B:	and I feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like, like put her in there.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And there, there's so much,
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, so your, you, I guess you're probably in the same, uh, same situation uh, we're in.
A:	We're kind of past having to provide child care.
A:	Our, our kids are grown up.
A:	We don't have any grandchildren yet.
A:	But, uh, uh, they're,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How old are your children?
A:	Uh, one's twenty-six
A:	and the other is, uh, twenty, twenty-one.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	So they're, uh, uh, They're, they're getting there.
B:	Well, they're going to be getting there.
A:	You know, there's no  no, no prospects right away for anything to happen.
B:	Yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I have, uh, five children.
B:	I have a eighteen year old son.
B:	The of my girls are like twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have three granddaughters right now.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, I, uh,
B:	one's in Iowa.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, she's, she's a teacher
B:	and what she does is she, teaches at a preschool.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And, and so she kind of,
B:	and they let her bring her, her little daughter in for free.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then, so
B:	but she just works part-time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah
B:	and she has to work full-time
B:	and it's just tearing her apart.
B:	She has a private baby-sitter.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, the baby just screams.
B:	I mean, the baby is like seventeen months
B:	and she just screams.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
B:	They're not even there yet you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's hard.
A:	We,
B:	And, and then I have my, uh, uh, I have a seven month old granddaughter
B:	and, uh, her mother stays home
B:	and she, they live, they live with us. You know, in, as Orange County is really expensive.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They live with us
B:	and so, of course, we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time.
B:	But, uh, uh, she just,
B:	uh, she used to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care
B:	and she says after working in there
B:	and, and, you know, here she was a provider
B:	but, you know, there's only so much one person can do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	She said it's so awful.
B:	She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a in a in a preschool.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.
A:	Huh.
B:	But it's really, it's really, really very difficult
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
A:	What did you do when your kids were growing up?
A:	Were you,
B:	Well, when, when
B:	the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, then after that I, I went to work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know,
B:	then I had one job
B:	and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job.
B:	And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter.
B:	Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church
B:	and I knew her personally.
B:	She had two kids of her own and everything.
B:	But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time.
B:	So when my son stayed over there, he got sick.
A:	He got sick,
A:	yeah.
B:	Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had,
B:	right?
A:	Right.
A:	Well,
B:	And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.
B:	Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten.
B:	But
B:	that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick.
B:	And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have.
B:	That's what he got, you know.
B:	Goes, well, okay,
B:	so it's not like he's going to infect her kids.
B:	But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up
B:	and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty
B:	so she said well she'll keep him home
B:	and he'll probably just sleep anyway.
B:	Well, you know, what
B:	that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten.
B:	She sent him to kindergarten.
B:	As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him
B:	and he threw up again
B:	and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office.
A:	yeah.
B:	And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter.
B:	Called her
B:	and they said, uh, that he's sick.
B:	Well she wasn't home.
A:	Huh.
B:	I mean her, all her kids were sick
B:	but she wasn't home, right.
B:	And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick.
B:	Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her?
B:	No,
B:	she didn't do that.
B:	So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty.
B:	And I had to leave work.
B:	It was, it was five o'clock in the evening
B:	and I found out he was still there at school.
B:	And they were calling me
B:	and they said somebody's got to pick him up.
B:	And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school.
B:	I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff.
B:	And he had a hundred and four fever.
B:	They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything.
A:	Right.
B:	I was so furious.
B:	I, I quit that job
B:	and I stayed home for awhile longer.
B:	Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a little more flexibility.
A:	You can come and go.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care
A:	Yeah.
A:	When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often uh, get them to come to the house.
A:	So, who's your favorite team?
B:	My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
A:	Pittsburgh?
B:	You bet.
A:	I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.
B:	Well, I, uh,
B:	when played he was from my hometown in Alabama,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	so I kind of grabbed on to that team,  way back when.
A:	Huh.
A:	pretty
A:	that's good.
A:	I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain,  or steel curtain.
B:	That's right.
B:	How about your favorite team?
A:	Huh.
A:	Well, last year it was Buffalo
A:	and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient
A:	and they never score.
A:	They never blow out their opponents.
A:	They just score just enough points,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that really impressed me.
A:	But then down here I
A:	is pretty close to New Orleans
A:	and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.
B:	Well, they are exciting, aren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot.
B:	Boy,
B:	they are, they are just a fun team to watch.
A:	This, it, they are really.
A:	Did you see the game Sunday night or,  Sunday afternoon?
B:	Uh,  no,
B:	I didn't.
A:	It was funny.
A:	There were, they uh, a fireworks display at halftime.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.
B:	Oh, you're kidding
A:	So, they had to stop the game lieu the third quarter and put out this fire.
B:	Oh, my
A:	Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field
A:	so there's this big fire on the field
A:	and they were dumping the bucket and everything.
B:	Oh, I can't believe that.
A:	It was
A:	I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen.
B:	That's hilarious.
A:	I know.
A:	It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.
B:	Oh.
A:	And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	He is tough,
B:	he has an incredible leg.
A:	He is.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year,  past the first playoff game?
A:	Uh I  I sure hope so.
A:	I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play.
A:	Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.
B:	Who's that?
A:	It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice
B:	Right.
A:	and one of those was to Buffalo.
A:	And they beat the Saints.
A:	Their only time they lost.
B:	What do you think about, uh, Houston?
A:	Houston.
A:	I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, from what I saw they were playing,
A:	when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,  right behind the Houston Oilers,
B:	Huh.
A:	and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.
B:	Huh.
A:	But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,
A:	and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think.
A:	He's,
A:	Yeah,
A:	the, their, their backfield is really impressive.
A:	Haywood and Drew Hill and
B:	Right.
A:	they really impress me.
B:	Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.
A:	That's right.
A:	Who, who did they play?
B:	They played Dallas.
A:	Dallas,
A:	that's right,
B:	They won,  in overtime.
A:	all because,
A:	That's right.
A:	I remember that now.
B:	So that was,
B:	I, I watched that game
B:	and, uh, that was, uh,
A:	Do you have a favorite between those two?
B:	Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division
B:	so,  I'll almost always root against them.
A:	Well, that's true.
A:	I hate to say it
A:	but I hate Dallas
B:	That's okay
B:	Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they just kind of grew on me.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I imagine.
A:	That's the way,
A:	I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two
A:	and they, they've actually started doing something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I've actually paid attention to them.
B:	Well
A:	Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?
B:	To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.
A:	Really?
B:	Um, what cities are they looking at?
A:	Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,  Houston play.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Saint Louis is trying to get a team.
A:	Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team,
A:	and there's some other city.
A:	I'm wanting to say Raleigh
A:	but I'm not sure.
B:	You know, I think you are right.
B:	I think it is Raleigh.
A:	Think so?
B:	I think I remember hearing that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because I know they've got a football team
A:	but I think it might be them.
B:	That would be fun.
B:	I'd like to see some more teams get in.
A:	I would, definitely.
A:	I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.
A:	And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis
A:	and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,
A:	I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.
B:	Definitely.
A:	Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that.
A:	I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you ever served on a jury before?
B:	Uh, I have twice.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	It was a pretty wild experience.
A:	Uh, what sorts of cases were they?
B:	They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know.
A:	So were they criminal or civil?
B:	They were civil.
B:	They weren't  they weren't any criminal.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	What, uh, what was the verdict?
A:	Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?
B:	Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people
A:	Yeah.
B:	so it was,
B:	they,
B:	and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.
A:	So did it become?
B:	So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
A:	Uh.
B:	but it then became unanimous.
A:	Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?
A:	You just needed a majority?
B:	Right.
A:	What was, what was the other case?
A:	That was also civil?
B:	The, the other case was just traffic,
B:	the,
B:	and, you know, it was seat belt law
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it, it didn't even hardly go through,
A:	Oh, didn't really even count.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm a college student
A:	so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long
B:	Yeah.
A:	um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point,
A:	but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.
A:	Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,
A:	but, I, I haven't.
A:	Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,
A:	but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
A:	Especially sort of.
B:	I wouldn't think that it does I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them,
A:	How,
B:	it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.
A:	Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?
B:	Yeah,
B:	but it was, you know, it was,
B:	jury was unorganized
B:	and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm not used to it not being organized,
B:	and I just assumed that it would have been.
A:	Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo
A:	and the jurors just sort of,
A:	someone had to figure out what was going on?
B:	That's about what it was.
A:	Um. That's interesting.
A:	Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?
A:	I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, well they picked one person,
B:	and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.
A:	So it it did end up working out pretty well?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it ended up working all right.
A:	The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
B:	Yes.
A:	you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,
A:	and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,
A:	it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,
A:	and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.
B:	I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on.
A:	In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer that, which was, uh, seemingly their property.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	It was on his property.
A:	Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,
A:	and he hadn't made the payments.
B:	Right.
B:	So they came to get it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property
B:	and he wouldn't let them take it off.
A:	Uh, so they were suing to get it back.
B:	So, and they are, it was a double wide,
B:	so they'd already taken it apart.
A:	Uh.
B:	So they left it there
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.
A:	Uh.
B:	So they were suing him for the money,
B:	and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,
A:	Uh, I get most of my news uh, from newspapers really.
A:	I read the daily newspaper, uh, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE
A:	and sometimes I'll read like the, uh, WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES.
A:	I don't subscribe to either,
A:	but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it.
A:	Uh, how about you?
A:	Do you, uh, mostly get things from T V or
B:	Yes.
B:	I actually get most of my news coverage off uh, computer networks.
B:	However, I do also watch television news, uh, usually in the morning once a day
B:	and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh that's interesting.
A:	You said computer networks.
A:	Uh, what, uh, what sort.
A:	I am fairly knowledgeable of
B:	Uh well, well DOW JONES for example have the, cause the  uh, news wire
A:	Uh, okay.
A:	That's interesting.
B:	and it's picked up and actually available, uh, at my office,
B:	so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure
B:	and it's sort of by category.
B:	For example so I can read a certain business or topics.
A:	Oh.
A:	is it, is it the A P news wire
A:	or is it something that is, uh, a little bit different from that?
B:	Well, uh, it's similar to that,
B:	but it's DOW JONES, which is, uh, the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire.
A:	Uh, okay.
A:	So, that's that's interesting.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've had, I had access in the past to, uh, uh, the A P news wire
A:	and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news.
A:	Uh, I've never used the DOW JONES news wire
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah
A:	it, uh,
A:	do you get any, uh, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach?
B:	Uh, well actually not.
B:	Uh, I do, uh, follow, uh, uh, uh,
B:	I don't know how to how to describe it
B:	so I'll say a religious newspaper which, which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense.
B:	It's a weekly but, uh, but not, uh, not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things.
A:	Yeah
B:	I'd like to say that however, uh, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
A:	In what way?
A:	In like, in sort of like, uh, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented or whatever?
B:	Uh, I think that it, I think that it has to do with, uh,
B:	I personally think, uh,
B:	I, I have a problem with their viewpoint
B:	and I personally think that, uh,  that there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well you won't offend me.
A:	So go ahead and say
A:	Yeah.
A:	Like a liberal type of bias.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	Uh, after all, who, who writes.
B:	People who are journalist who are trained to write
B:	and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field at least from academia
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it,
A:	They, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, even if it's not technical. If it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter.
B:	If I am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it.
B:	They're telling me lies.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you, by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes
A:	or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things?
B:	Uh, I think both.
B:	Uh, by deliberate I, uh, I mean mistake, mistakes of omission or, uh, or, uh, biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, uh, to give you an example, uh, we will go out of the printing media.
B:	I know of cases where, uh, we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Which is which is rather disturbing.
A:	Huh.
A:	Huh. That's disturbing.
B:	I mean he does that.
A:	I haven't really noticed them doing that,
A:	but whatever,
A:	again I don't watch T V news that much now.
A:	If I had access to C N N, I would watch T V news more.
A:	Uh, I don't you know, but I don't usually.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time
B:	and it was,
B:	I did during the Gulf War
B:	and it was addictive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Did you, did you think that C N N, well, the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality?
A:	I just I guess.
A:	I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks.
B:	uh, it's like low impact aerobics
B:	but at, it ...
A:	Oh, instead of hopping and jumping you just step
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you, you have a step
B:	and you literally step up on the step and move your arms,
B:	it's, it's, it's, it's new,
A:	Huh.
B:	it's fun.
A:	I probably couldn't do that because of my knee
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	bad knee
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, and, uh, I do toning a lot and, uh, some,
B:	every once in a while I play tennis,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm not too great at it
B:	but I, I try to play,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've, I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself,
A:	I mean, it's
A:	I guess what I do now is I play softball, right now,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that's about,
A:	well, right now I'm on two teams
A:	so it's four nights a week.
B:	Gosh
A:	But, uh, uh, so I enjoy it
A:	but, as far as, you know, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there, I went and bought a weight bench, and don't ever hardly use it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ha,
B:	right,
A:	I need to make myself do that.
B:	yeah,
B:	I slacked off a little because of, um,
B:	I'm about to graduate from college
B:	and so this past couple months have been really hectic
B:	so I haven't really gone,
B:	and I've really faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out
B:	but ...
A:	What school you going to?
B:	I'm at East Carolina.
A:	Oh
B:	But, um, no,
B:	I, uh,
B:	my step classes and toning is about the only thing
B:	well, I mean ...
A:	Now what's, what's toning?
A:	Is that lifting weights?
B:	It's, um, like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	you can do with,
A:	Isometrics, stuff like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can do it with certain, you know, you can do it with weights if you wanted to
B:	but, you know, you leave out of there
B:	usually the next morning, if you haven't done it in a while, you wake up the next morning
B:	you're like, oh, no,
B:	what did I do to myself
B:	and your whole body aches, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape,
B:	uh, I feel like I'm out of shape
B:	but I feel guilty for not going, because I really I'm, I'm so used to going for, you know, three or four years now.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, stayed in pretty good shape during school.
B:	But, um,
A:	I played baseball, all the way through
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, working out six hours a day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of, kept us all in pretty good shape,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But, uh, ever, ever since I got out of school, you know, just jumped right into the job
A:	and, I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule. *listen; possible typo stuff = tough?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	some, um,
B:	I walk a lot because, uh, you know, being in, in school we,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if your campus was anything like ours,
B:	but our parking lot's in one end of the, of the campus
B:	and the school, the buildings are all at the other end,
B:	so.
A:	No,
A:	I didn't have, well, much of a problem
A:	we, I guess I went to a small Baptist school
A:	and we had about, when I was there, maybe thirteen hundred people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	that's if ...
A:	So, it's pretty small.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, uh,
B:	I live, I live on the second story apartments
B:	so I walk up and down stairs all day long,
B:	so.
B:	Uh,
A:	Uh, we've got a one story house now
A:	that's, that's enough.
A:	I guess I push the lawn mower around
A:	that's, fairly regular
B:	Yeah
B:	one of the exercise,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, um, would like to start running.
B:	I've never been much of a runner
B:	but I want to start,
B:	I want to run
B:	but I don't, I don't know if I'll be able to, to do it.
A:	What
A:	just, because you don't like to or because, because you won't be able to.
B:	I'm, I'm afraid I won't be able to.
A:	Oh, if you do, if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running.
B:	I
B:	Yeah.
B:	I hope not. Um,
A:	We've, we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't even own a bike,
B:	I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve,
B:	so.
B:	Uh, I don't know,
B:	I'd be afraid, afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike, you know.
A:	No,
A:	you can't forget how to ride a bike.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, um, no,
B:	I guess that's about the only form,
B:	I'm trying to think of, of other things that I do that will be considered exercise,
A:	Yeah.
B:	there are things I should do.
B:	I know
A:	Now, when I was going to,
A:	I, I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred,
A:	well, when we were at this junior college, uh, our coach, you know,
A:	we,
A:	one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics
A:	and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, they, uh,
A:	I mean, it was a regular,
A:	I mean, we had it for course credit,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but still, I mean, it was pretty high impact stuff,
B:	Those aerobic classes are, are tough the, the high impact.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Definitely are, are tough classes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and she'd, uh, you know,
A:	most of the guys were all in one class
A:	so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	First at eight, I think we had
A:	eight o'clock in the morning, was our class.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wake up.
B:	Well, now they have those, uh, those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you have like bands,
B:	I don't know, if you've seen them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they're ... Yeah, they're, they're weird.
A:	I think my wife has some.
B:	They're, uh, you they're just made of, I guess it's different kinds of rubber,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and they get,
A:	Or sand even some of them,
A:	well, no,
A:	they're elastic
A:	so I guess it wouldn't be sand.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there's some that, like the different colors denotes how much they, how much the tension I guess they are and how easy they are to move.
A:	Huh.
B:	Uh, there's like, I know there's purple, gray, and, uh, green.
B:	And some of them are real short
B:	and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, those classes I, I enjoy.
B:	Uh, I think, uh, with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun.
B:	If you don't have one that's fun, and not enjoy it, look, not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing, the class is not going to get out, uh, what they should get out of the class.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, if the,
A:	So, are you going to get into instructing?
A:	Well, what are you studying?
B:	Oh, I'm an interior design major,
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	not in the, not in the, aerobic instructor type field.
B:	Oh.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	oh, I could never do that I don't think,
B:	I'd rather just be the student,
B:	And, uh, Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just ...
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the, uh, the, some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting,
A:	I mean, they, they, they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups, with those things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, man, they are, it,
A:	I don't know
A:	to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there, and workout and then drive back
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, they, um, I just noticed at our health club they put these computerized one, these computerized machines,
B:	and you set a speed on it and the weight
B:	and it, and it makes you do it.
B:	And it tells you
B:	like if you're going too slow it will say, my grandmother could do this faster than you. And stuff like, a turtle goes faster
B:	and, um, it tells it
B:	and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you.
A:	A little negative reinforcement there while you're going.
B:	Yeah
B:	So, uh, do that, stuff like that
B:	but just I've never used those machines
B:	I just use the regular machines and the free weights, you know, like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights.
A:	Yeah.
B:	to do, you know, some bicep, tricep exercises.
B:	Sit-ups, of course.
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm just getting real soft in the middle.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I think that's, uh, number one problem with everyone
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight
A:	I'm, I guess I probably put on about ten, nine or ten pounds, since I stopped playing, which was about four years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I've, just myself I just notice myself just really, real soft
A:	and I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I intend, I keep saying I intend to get back into it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just need to, put the old nose to the grindstone,
A:	I, I, I guess at that point it would turn into a task,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't consider it fun doing that,
A:	but.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I plan on getting back, once I graduate next weekend.
A:	Next weekend?
B:	Next weekend.
A:	All right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	one week,
B:	Then I plan to get right back into it.
B:	You know, it's, it does a lot for you I think.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Makes you feel a lot better.
A:	oh, no,
A:	yeah,
A:	there, there's no, no question the, the end result is great
A:	and I, I mean, I enjoyed, you know,
A:	we,
A:	when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired, you know
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and I mean you feel so much better, about yourself.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Just you know, you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner,
A:	Oh, I still don't,
A:	but That's a problem.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, good luck on your graduation and your ...
B:	All righty,
B:	well, thank you.
B:	It was nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you too.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two
A:	And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.
A:	Uh, it does seem to be a lot of habits to break.
A:	I, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on it,
A:	but my kids are
A:	and so they, they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,
A:	and we were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out
A:	and they weren't worth anything anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we
A:	it took us, almost a year to get a garbage sack full.
A:	We just don't drink that many.
A:	So as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something
A:	and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh,
A:	at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,
A:	and we came out with about a dollar
A:	it just really wasn't worth it.
B:	And a lot of hassle all year round
B:	and cans laying,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, they, they realized, you know,
A:	well, of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.
A:	That wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,
A:	but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
A:	and then, uh, T I started keeping up with, uh, cans there,
A:	so occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.
A:	Least it gets back into the system,
A:	but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up.
A:	Have you all got the individual containers yet?
B:	No,
B:	I read in the paper this week where maybe,
B:	I don't know if it was,
B:	I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time.
A:	Um.
B:	But, it, it should be starting, I would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that
B:	I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,
B:	I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seemed like, uh,
A:	if, if I recall, it's been a long time.
A:	They're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.
A:	They were fine on the green, big green containers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have a bin
A:	and all different types would go in there
A:	and then that they would sort it as as needed.
B:	Oh.
A:	It, it seemed that there was,
A:	at the time anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting.
A:	But when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh,
A:	the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,
A:	so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than, than having a household try it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I, I don't know,
A:	that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house.
B:	Well, it would get messy, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	I, I, I know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and whatnot. And, uh, which we're not in the habit of doing.
A:	Right.
A:	That's true.
B:	I was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans.
B:	They had bottles
B:	and you'd return them to the the grocery store
A:	Right.
B:	and you'd get our money back
B:	and that, that was all well and good.
B:	They don't seem to still be doing that.
B:	If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,
B:	but, I guess this day and age they don't.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They don't do that.
A:	We live next to a set of railroad tracks
A:	and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash, you know break them,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, they weren't that successful,
A:	so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
A:	and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they, uh,
B:	I, I think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,
B:	they can get more somewhere else.
A:	Yeah,
A:	just a little bit of begging will
B:	Uh, for a good,
B:	right.
B:	They're,
B:	the nickels, the dimes or what, I suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I wonder,
B:	But, we, we did buy a can crusher
B:	and we are crushing cans
B:	and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,
B:	so I would say in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	So that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles
A:	Where do you take your cans?
B:	Well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up.
B:	Since we've had the crusher all summer, we I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't oh,
B:	I think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the
A:	Hello, Lynn.
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you have any pets?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have a dog and cat now.
A:	Oh, what are their names?
B:	Tibby and Liberty.
A:	Which is the dog and which is the cat?
B:	Tibby is the dog
B:	and Liberty is the cat.
A:	Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, one's real nice,
A:	but the other one is a, well,
A:	she's pretty wild.
B:	Oh Ours are pretty calm.
A:	Yeah,
A:	are they, um, just house pets?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, that's what ours are too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep.
B:	So that's why we call her Liberty.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. Um.
B:	Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	I've had a skunk
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've had a Burmese python,
B:	I've had rats,
B:	I've had mice
A:	Wow.
B:	uh, let's see,
B:	I've had gerbils,
B:	I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
A:	Wow.
A:	Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?
B:	Yes
A:	Yeah.
B:	it was litter trained
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we had it perfumed
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was very aggressive.
A:	Right.
B:	But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and the skunk.
B:	And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Nobody came near it when he was there.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh, I had, I had a dog one time,
A:	and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed
B:	Oh.
A:	so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them,
B:	but the glands had been removed
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so,
A:	Right,
A:	but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	why, I don't know,
A:	I, I think they're kind of nice to have,
A:	they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to,
A:	I don't know,
A:	when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like,
A:	I don't know,
A:	something giving you some affection as well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I always said if I Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog
A:	What, what do you think?
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That'd be the best way to be.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs?
B:	Well we had a German Shepherd
B:	and he had dysplasia
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
A:	Really.
B:	So, when he died, we got a little one.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old,
B:	and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
A:	Uh-huh
A:	almost cruel for him to, to walk.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he just, he couldn't get up,
B:	he couldn't walk,
B:	so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds,
B:	so it was a chore.
A:	Wow, yeah.
B:	So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then we've had three cats in our married life,
B:	and we've got a calico now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've got a calico cat too.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	she's the, she's the nice one.
A:	We, uh, we used to live in an apartment
A:	and like, our cats never went outside,
A:	but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out,
A:	and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy,
A:	and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in
B:	Um.
A:	so, we had to, we had to flea bath them
A:	and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, don't even talk to me,
B:	I, when I was single I had gone away for the weekend,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat,
B:	and he let her out,
B:	and my house was loaded with fleas,
B:	I mean, you walked in
B:	and your legs were just black.
A:	Really.
B:	And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I found it, you know, in the street.
A:	Oh.
B:	I was a social worker at the time, and found it,
B:	Now is it Stacy?
A:	Angie.
B:	Angie,
B:	I'm sorry.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?
A:	Um, let's see,
A:	uh, I like seafood.
A:	Uh, let's see,
A:	uh, shrimp, steamed uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.
A:	Uh, spicy lobster with linguini.
B:	That sounds good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And what would that be like, a clam or, uh,
A:	Right.
B:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too.
A:	Uh, and that way, you can have a variety. Uh,
B:	So if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?
A:	Uh,
B:	Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	fresh vegetables would be good
A:	or, uh, just,
B:	Probably not nachos and dip, huh?
A:	No.
B:	And would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	And then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?
A:	Oh, all these hard questions
A:	Uh, what, white wine?
B:	That would be my guess.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, And then, uh, uh, dessert.
A:	I'm not really a drinker,
A:	so I'm not, I don't know a lot about that.
B:	Something sweet?
A:	Oh, goodness.
A:	Uh, chocolate, something chocolate.
A:	Uh
B:	You must like chocolate.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, let's see.
B:	Usually when we have a dinner party, I always, I like to grill.
A:	Oh, you do?
B:	So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.
B:	One of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think, is that what comes in  those little blocks?  And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
B:	and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail.
B:	And then I like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops.
B:	And then we have, uh, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then, uh, I don't know what we usually have for dessert.
B:	Cake sometimes,
B:	but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, I guess.
A:	That sounds good, too.
B:	But that's, I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come over.
A:	Traditional
A:	right?
B:	Traditional,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind.
A:	I just started, I just really started, uh, uh, learning about that
A:	and I bought a Martha Stewart,
A:	I don't know if you've heard of her.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Her cookbook
A:	and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods.
B:	Oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?
A:	Um, my father owns a restaurant.
B:	Oh, in, uh, Is it in Dallas?
A:	It's, it's just a, uh, a cafe,
A:	so it's not really anything, you know, that I want to,
A:	it's not the same
A:	Uh, it's in Lewisville.
B:	Okay,
B:	all right.
B:	So you graduated from which high school?
A:	Trinity.
B:	Trinity,
B:	okay.
B:	And that's a public school or private?
A:	That's public.
B:	Huh, okay,
B:	I have to get to know this area a little better, I guess.
B:	Uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?
A:	No,
A:	uh-huh, *listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?
A:	it's not.
B:	Um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	what else for catering. Uh,
A:	Let's see,
A:	what about Hawaiian luau.
B:	Oh, that would be good.
A:	Could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,
A:	let's see, uh,
B:	And you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to.
A:	I think, I think decorating your food is, you know, really,
A:	Uh, we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's about, oh, about six months old,
A:	and we're
A:	we live in an apartment,
A:	so, we don't have a yard,
A:	so it has to stay inside
A:	and we're having a difficult time trying to train it.
B:	How old is it?
A:	It's about six months.
B:	Uh, you, you're, you're in the roughest stages of pet  ownership, I think.
A:	Really?
A:	But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs,
A:	but I guess every one, one one, one of them, or every once in a while, you get one that's not so intelligent because this one, it.
B:	Well. I don't, I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence, really, the, the, the training bit, uh.
B:	I've had dogs through the years.
B:	Right now I've got two, and three cats,
B:	but, uh, and my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix,
B:	and we watched it this summer for two to three months,
B:	and it wasn't trained quite fully either
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so how'd you all, how do you,
A:	what's the best method?
B:	I don't know.
B:	I, I'm old fashioned,
B:	and when I got my, my dogs, when they, when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside.
A:	Right.
B:	They say that's not the way to do it now.
B:	You're just supposed to
A:	Stand outside with them until they.
B:	No,
B:	just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you catch them in the act.
A:	Well, we're hardly ever at home,
A:	so it's kind of difficult,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, you don't want to, you don't want to spank it or scare it, or anything like that,
A:	so.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	you don't want to do that,
B:	but, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we try to take it, you know,
A:	it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside
A:	and, you know  and then it runs right inside
B:	Does, does it just want to sniff around?
B:	Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside?
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot of times,
A:	and you know, it won't it's little job outside
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it comes inside.
B:	Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	we've tried that,
A:	and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, and he chews on plants and all that,
A:	but, you know, that's natural  for a little puppy. Huh?
B:	That's nothing, huh.
B:	Well, it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you.
B:	I, I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever,
B:	and she's gone the other way,
B:	because she's so old, she doesn't have much control
A:	Oh, really.
B:	so we're battling with that problem
A:	Oh, that's sad.
B:	and she still feels good.
B:	Uh, she can't hear worth a darn or see very well,
B:	but she's got a great appetite,
B:	and she knows we're there, by smell.
A:	How old is it?
B:	She'll be sixteen in May.
A:	Man that's sad.
B:	And yeah,
B:	but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years,
A:	Oh, of course not.
B:	so we're putting up with all her accidents,
A:	I couldn't.
B:	and the
B:	two nights ago, she had diarrhea,
B:	and so that was a bad one.
B:	But, uh, I think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend
A:	That is really sad.
A:	What, what's the deal,
A:	we, we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so it, I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, you know, tug on it to walk it.
A:	I mean, it just goes like a mad dog,
A:	I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping,
A:	and  it's, you know, I mean, it's not even close to even being trained on a leash.
B:	Does it, oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, maybe you you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, you know,
A:	they sometimes misuse their license or whatever you know,
B:	Oh.
A:	they treat them bad.
B:	Well, you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland
A:	Oh, really?
B:	and we took,
B:	my, my daughter was living at home then,
B:	and she took our Golden Retriever, oh, not the Golden Retriever, the Norwegian Elk Hound over there
A:	Oh, really?
B:	and, it, it, it's a pretty good class,
B:	and they did pretty good, except this dog is,
B:	she's just pretty,
B:	she's not smart
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, she didn't learn a lot,
B:	but it, I think it calmed her down a little bit,
B:	and she's used to being around other dogs now.
A:	How long did it take?
B:	I think it was like a six week program.
A:	Every, what?
B:	Uh, I think it was one night a week for like six weeks,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	and, uh, you know, it was a group class, outside.
B:	It was fairly reasonable, too.
A:	Well, Sheltie Collies are, you know, timid,
A:	and they don't really,
A:	unless they get used to something, they're really nervous
A:	and.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're, they're usually, a high-strung dog aren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and, uh, if they're not accustomed to something, they, they're really scared.
A:	So.
B:	Um, our, our friend has a,
A:	Okay,
A:	um, I guess we're going to talk, describe, uh, job benefits,
A:	and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits?
B:	Uh, I would say the medical, uh, group insurance area as far as, uh, covering medical costs for yourself or family members.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, um, does your company have good benefits in that, in that regard?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think,
B:	I work for a public school system, district
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,
B:	where the school district does, um, the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of, uh, costs.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But overall, um, I've been pleased with it over the years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to alter, uh, you know, change companies,
B:	or now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see.
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Uh, well I'm,
A:	my medical coverage is with an H M O
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, so, that's, in my opinion, that's that's bordering on a health clinic,
A:	but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year, or calendar years,
B:	and I was in the H M O,
B:	and, um, I was because my, my same doctor, you know, agreed to be in it for, uh,
B:	they usually sign a contract or something
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, uh, I did have surgery last summer
B:	and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day,
B:	and I've never seen another bill,
B:	so I I have to say it really works.
A:	Right.
B:	But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it.
B:	Uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, you know, ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for you know, those people.
A:	Yes.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm, I'm fairly young myself,
A:	I've only been,
A:	when I first started working which,
A:	three years ago is when I first got into full time employment
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, at that time I immediately joined the H M O,
A:	and I never really,
A:	so the only doctor I, I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O,
A:	and, uh you know, for me it's worked out real good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	but if you, you know, have a family and, and, um, everybody's gone to different doctors, uh, it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your, just has, you know, all the medical history
B:	and you feel comfortable with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I'm sure it would be very stressful
B:	and, my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay.
B:	You can continue to go to your own doctor
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but your benefits are not as, you know, good,
B:	so, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, like you, you mentioned you work for a school system.
A:	I work for, uh, Georgia Tech in the  research branch,
B:	Oh, all right.
A:	and I guess another one that, that I rank up there high is the, uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, um, I enjoy as a benefit.
B:	I do too.
B:	Are you talking about like Spring Break
B:	and,
A:	Right
B:	Right.
A:	yeah,
A:	getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation.
B:	Right.
B:	It, it really, um,
B:	I don't think most of our teachers,
B:	now I'm not a teacher,
B:	I am a secretarial executive assistant,
B:	but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all, all year long frankly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It is just, Texas has really, um, you know,
B:	they want everybody educated, no matter what it costs,
B:	uh, and it, it would be just,
B:	we all look forward to,
B:	like in two weeks we have Spring Break,
B:	and I don't know who looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	What do you do there?
A:	Well, um, I'm not actually on the teaching faculty,
A:	but we have a large research organization associated with the university,
A:	and that's who I work with.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, and we're given, you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do.
A:	We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something
A:	Right.
B:	and, um, it's good that they allow you that.
A:	Right.
B:	It, um,
B:	as I say, the schools,
B:	now we do have to work, you know, the day,
B:	but we do get many days off,
B:	and, uh, we all look forward to it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college
B:	but at the  time, I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I've just continued to, uh, stay there
A:	Are there, are there any things that, that you'd like to see changed in terms of the, the benefits?
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess it took,
A:	so I guess the recording has started now.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	So, have you ever served on a jury?
A:	I served,
A:	I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury.
A:	A lot of the same rules apply.
A:	Have you ever served on one?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I finally served on one last year.
B:	I've, um, been voting for years,
B:	and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I finally was.
B:	So it was an interesting experience.
B:	I was kind of boring. *listen; should I be "it"
A:	Was it civil or criminal?
B:	Uh, it was, uh uh, it was, uh, well, let's see, it was municipal court
A:	A grand jury or,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so it was a combination of, uh,
B:	and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks
A:	I see.
B:	so it was a combination of criminal and civil,
B:	and they had, uh,
B:	well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, uh, just sit in the jury room.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, did, did the judge, uh, hand down sentences
A:	or did you folks do that?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	the judge did.
B:	Uh, I, uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury.
B:	I kept getting, uh,
B:	I'd be questioned, uh, for empaneling the jury,
B:	and they kept, uh, dismissing me.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	Course they don't have to give a reason,
B:	but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,
A:	No.
B:	they want to get the best, uh, mix for their case,
B:	so they ask all kinds of wild questions.
A:	That that's a science in itself.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,
B:	and I think part of it was they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I see.
A:	Because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical
A:	and
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was probably it,
B:	although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, were, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,
A:	or would,
A:	if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.
B:	Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing.
B:	Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day,
B:	and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case,
B:	and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty,
B:	and he would never vote for guilty.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman
B:	and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,
B:	so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate.
A:	Um.
B:	So the whole thing had to be tried over again.
A:	Wow,
A:	I bet that made him happy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was, uh, it was funny.
B:	The, uh,
B:	I I, I don't know,
B:	I, uh, I didn't, uh, uh, I didn't like not being able to deliberate.
A:	Right.
B:	I, uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,
B:	and the other people were kind of mixed
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.
B:	Cost him a lot of money,
B:	I'm sure.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, how many members were on the jury?
A:	Was it a six or twelve member jury?
B:	Uh, it must have been six.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's kind of curious to me.
A:	I didn't realize until the, uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries.
A:	I thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak.
B:	Um.
A:	But, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.
B:	Um.
A:	I know on a
A:	getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.
A:	It's a simple majority, you know, rules.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, let's  see,
B:	is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous
B:	and,
A:	Probably on capital,
A:	I don't know,
A:	we weren't, we, we,
A:	the two that I were on had to do with drugs
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,
A:	the government really failed to prove its case,
A:	and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,
A:	and we had to acquit him in both cases.
B:	Uh, it was too circumstantial?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,
A:	but something happened to the camera and the tape and
B:	Um.
A:	all they could do was testify,
A:	Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore?
B:	That's a good question.
B:	Uh, there would be a point, there was a point where I would have said, no, that no one would deserve to die for, for a crime that he committed.
B:	But, uh, since I've become a parent and since I've seen, uh, things like Jeffrey I really have to question that.
B:	I really, uh, I, I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment.
B:	Uh,
A:	Of the statements made by people against the, the death penalty, um, I, I like the statement made by Cuomo.
A:	Cuomo I believe is,
A:	um, he's, he's governor of New York
A:	but, uh, he's, uh, against the death penalty.
A:	But, um, he said that he would, he would want to, to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if, if they did something to his wife.
A:	And that's,
A:	but, but, even, even in that in that, uh, uh, situation he would he would hope that there would be people around him who would, uh, keep him from doing the, doing the things.
B:	Oh, it's a, uh, it's a question of your, your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly.
B:	Uh, and that was the thing that, uh, killed Dukakis back, uh, four years ago when someone asked him a similar question
B:	and he, he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when, uh, people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh, a gut level reaction.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level.
B:	Uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think people are, are working at that from more of a, uh, a gut reaction than a, a reason humane one.
A:	See, I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do.
A:	Are they reformatories, where we're trying to take people who can't survive or, or that, that aren't conforming enough to society so that, that we work well together.
A:	Or are they,
A:	is it a penal institution?
A:	Is it, is, is it designed for punishment?
A:	Um, the death penalty surely fits in well with, uh, in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment.
A:	Uh, perhaps not in the manner that we do it
A:	but, but it, in, in theory it fits in.
A:	In system, in a reformatory, I mean
A:	if you, if you put someone to death you obviously, can't reform them.
B:	That's true.
A:	So.
B:	Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent
B:	and I really don't, uh, agree with that.
B:	I don't think anyone who would commit a, uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person
B:	but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me
B:	so I better not do it.
B:	I, I just,  don't think that, uh, that it works that way.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think it's done.
A:	I don't think we run it as a deterrent.
A:	I mean people say that,
A:	but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know,
A:	they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And if we really if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public.
A:	I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever, nobody ever sees it.
A:	If someone ever,
A:	if, you know,
A:	like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had to sit and watch and, and see a guy burn or, or, you know, something or shot by a firing squad or something like that.
A:	I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than, you know, telling them that there's, there's protestors out here at the, you know.
B:	Well, I, I don't know if that would really work that way or not.
B:	Uh, there's a lot of violence,
A:	Um, are you working right now?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I am.
B:	I'm working in the computer science department here uh, at C M U.
A:	Uh,
A:	What kind of, what kind of work do you do?
B:	Uh, I'm doing basically system, system design work and, uh, implementation work for the speech, for the speech group uh, here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	is that how you heard about this thing?
B:	Yeah,
A:	Uh,
B:	actually through electronic mail.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Me too.
A:	I work at, uh, the Georgia Tech Research Institute.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I'm a co-op student
A:	so I work and go to school about halftime.
A:	And, uh, I really don't have any job benefits to speak of.
A:	We're kind of, um,
A:	I don't know,
A:	they just kind of forget us on that end.
A:	We don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really
A:	so.
B:	Right.
B:	So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away,  at, at this point
A:	Exactly.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What about you?
B:	Well, um, I'm research stuff here now
B:	so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package.
B:	It's not quite as good as industry
B:	but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um,
B:	and they pay for you know, pay for the classes.
A:	Huh.
B:	So,  that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, they do that I think if you're, uh, research here
A:	then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters
A:	and I think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that.  Pay for the classes and stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I know they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage.
A:	You know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to, if you want to finish,
B:	If you want to,  do it quickly.
A:	you want to,
A:	Yeah.
A:	They'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters
A:	and then, I think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due
A:	so that will probably help out.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary
B:	I'd, you know, I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we do.
B:	We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's kind of split between C M U and,  and, you know, the employee.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, I mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems.
A:	My dad, I think my,
A:	I'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works,
A:	but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it's also, right now it's, uh, the,
B:	like everywhere else, uh,
B:	here in Pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's a whole other topic to begin with too
B:	but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but it's, you are right.
B:	I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important.
A:	the I think the, I guess the only real, um, benefit I guess you could say working, for me working here, besides I mean
A:	I'm learning and stuff because,  I'm at, you know, in school.
B:	Right.
A:	But there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. that's about, five percent right there
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Oh
B:	Now that's a big win.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	That's,
A:	That's about the only real bonus
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have, so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,  or so.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I figured for
B:	and they've just raised the, um, income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty, you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean
B:	the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is, is consult for, um, you know, other companies.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Um, so that's, that kind of helps out in terms of,  you know, keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, in case,  you know, in case you ever need to bail out
A:	help a lot.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See around, around here it's like, uh,
A:	we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,
A:	Type of music is hot down in Texas?
B:	Uh, well, I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas.
B:	I know what's hot down here with me,
B:	so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know,
B:	I don't ever listen to the radio
B:	and that's usually what's hot around here
B:	so, So, what kind of music do you like?
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, mostly folk music.
B:	Folk music.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I find myself, uh, listening to a lot of, uh, uh, either old timer or New England, uh, dance bands as well as, uh, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, we're on totally different wavelengths.
A:	Okay.
B:	I'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know, uh, Van Halen, that kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what about, uh, classic rock type stations.
B:	Uh, I don't listen to the radio at all.
B:	We live in a fairly small town,
B:	so uh, classic rock for me is what I have, which is like, uh, Doors, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, some some of the older Eagles stuff was good.
B:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I didn't like, uh,
A:	they started getting a little more, you know,
A:	the type of music, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes
A:	and I don't like listening at high volumes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, some of their older stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable to me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well they,
A:	You know, Hotel California and that era.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	that does, that's something you don't, doesn't even sound good loud really. You know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, definitely.
B:	Uh, so, anything new you like coming out now, other than folk music, some I might know of.
B:	I don't know any folk music at all.
A:	Well, down in Texas, uh, you know, little, listen to a little country every now and then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah,
B:	here,
A:	I'm sure there's a lot of that down there.
B:	Oh, plenty.
B:	Way, way more than I can stand down here.
B:	I, I don't care for it at all, that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it.
B:	I,
A:	Well, there, there's a Conway Twitty twang,
A:	then there's the, uh, Dolly Parton, uh, Hollywood sound.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's more, even more commercialized for of country music.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, it's getting, uh, uh, getting pretty big everywhere, as I see it.
B:	Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop charts.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is.
B:	Concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd,
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think.
B:	It's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, you know.
A:	Hey,
A:	I, I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and that's all it,
A:	But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were
B:	Yeah.
A:	late, late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message.
B:	That's what it,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what, what you say,
B:	and, and then music is wrapped around now.
B:	Now, it's the other way around.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I don't, I don't think Gun,
A:	at least to my mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	they don't have anything really important you want to hear.
B:	But, you know, it's kind of odd,
B:	it's like, it doesn't have to be good,
B:	it's just who does it, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You hear a, you hear a Paula Abdul song
B:	and you,
B:	and I think, if somebody else were to play that, you know, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would think, that's lousy,
B:	but because she did it, it's supposed to be good, you know,
B:	it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do more than anything.
A:	Right.
B:	Madonna can do anything
B:	and it would be considered good because it's Madonna, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	Madonna could start playing folk music
B:	and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it,
B:	so it's, it's, it's really backwards how things are working now
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's the artist, not the merit.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
B:	So, I don't know, I, I don't know that that's, I don't think that's a good thing at all,
B:	but that's that's what the, point we've reached,
B:	so I don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way, at least.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	I know for myself that, uh, for the most part, I don't know which artist is which,
A:	so I listen to a song,
A:	I either like the song
A:	or I don't like it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it was.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's about how I am on popular music.
B:	I don't, you know, you don't, I don't know enough about it because I just listen,
B:	uh, everything I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they play on the radio
B:	so,
A:	Well, you have to figure out what to buy,
A:	or do you just buy along the same artist?
B:	Uh, I,
B:	yeah,
B:	I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time.
B:	I don't really switch around to new things very often.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, it's, you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album, then you stop?
B:	Uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	generally,
B:	or, about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I listen to it that way,
B:	but as far as,
B:	yeah,
B:	I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, that's one thing I like about the, uh, some of the folk music scenes, you know,
A:	there's a couple of nice, uh, small coffee houses up in New Jersey.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, it's very nice,
A:	you go into the coffee house
A:	and, you know, an artist is there
A:	and very often the artist will have a an album
A:	and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So you definitely get to try before you buy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's definitely
B:	I,
A:	You know, it,
A:	you, you, you don't always quite get it right,
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	you go first.
A:	Well, I have, uh, two kids,
A:	I have one seven and one five
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they're in a public school here in Tyler
A:	and, uh, I'm happy with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm happy with the school,
A:	it's great,
A:	good teachers
A:	good curriculum, uh,
A:	they learn a lot,
A:	they have no problems, uh,
A:	but I do live in the better, well, in the best part of the city,
A:	though, I live in, you know, the real richy part, I guess.
A:	I'm not,
A:	but, everybody around me is
A:	and, uh, but they're,
A:	I have friends that live in the other, the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town
A:	and their schools are kind of rundown and, uh, older
A:	and they don't really offer as much, I don't know, as, uh, the school that my girls are in.
A:	I don't really think that's fair. You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but, you know, I'm happy with what they're in,
A:	so, go ahead
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	it, it's, it's pretty much what I was going to say
B:	is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I grew up in New York
B:	and uh, the place,
A:	Wow.
B:	or not New York City, upstate New York
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I went to, uh, the City of Rochester School District
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
B:	and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed geographically from each other,
B:	but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, one of the things that probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system.
A:	Right.
B:	And that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money
B:	because what was happening was, you know, all the very rich people went out to the, move out to the suburbs
B:	and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	As a result, the schools were rundown,
B:	there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked.
B:	There wasn't as many advanced placement courses, uh, when I was a senior that some other schools had.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it, it,
B:	so I, you know, I think that one of the things, one of the ways to, to, to help schools in general, uh, and get them all to a minimum level of, of, of competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people,
B:	and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right
B:	So, you know it, it's kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of.
A:	Also, uh, the, the family environment,
A:	you know, you can come to south Tyler where I live
A:	and you have got room mothers in every room,
A:	you've got art mothers,
A:	you've got every, every holiday,
A:	there's parties.
A:	All these kids have these really supportive, really supportive parents, always up there for something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You can go to north Tyler to the schools
A:	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, that has a, a whole lot to do with it, you know,
A:	as far as their learning, I mean, if the parents aren't, uh, you know, willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know, they really don't have much of a chance at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Why is that?
A:	Huh?
B:	Why is that?
A:	Why
A:	You they just don't,
A:	I mean, I mean, I'm, I'm up there at my kids' school,
A:	I know what they're learning
A:	and if they're up, I call and find out, you know,
A:	is she having problems,
A:	does she need help with anything,
A:	no,
A:	she's doing fine,
A:	okay, you know, uh,
A:	and I, I know kids that their parents could really give a rip
A:	and the kids are not motivated.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	They have no motivation from home,
A:	so they just go to school
A:	and, you know, you know, I'll get through the day, and, uh, bring homework home
A:	and, there's nobody to, to sit them down and say, you're going to do this.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, just, you know, they, they take a notion to do it,
A:	they do,
A:	and, uh, that doesn't work either, you know,
A:	they have to have guidance
A:	and uh, they can't just have it at school and then come home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there's nothing, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know that that, that was a big factor for me.
B:	I ended up coming out of, of the public school system very well and was very good education, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been, you know, which is really nice,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there,
A:	Yeah.
B:	was, like, well,
B:	yeah,
B:	of course you're going to study and do well
B:	and that's the way,
B:	of course, are you,
A:	The last auto repair I had was
A:	I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck
A:	I had a tune up done
A:	and I had, I had the brakes done on it
A:	and then, the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope
A:	and it has eight spark plugs
A:	and it's hard to, to get get at them
A:	and plus the time on them.
A:	I just don't have time any more.
A:	Uh, as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself, I, I usually change the oil and wash the air filter
A:	and I, I had an occasion to change, to have to change the battery once,
A:	but, the brakes, I was really surprised that the brakes
A:	I wanted,
A:	I do have the background.
A:	I know what needs to be done
A:	and I know that the oil needs, should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings
A:	and the lube, lubrication system needs to be lubricated and
A:	so I, I stay on top of that
A:	but I I wanted my front wheels,
A:	I wanted the bearings packed
A:	and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that
A:	or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
B:	Just to pack the bearings?
A:	just to pack the bearings,
A:	but what I found is that they had a brake job
A:	and they,
A:	I had them,
A:	the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics.
A:	That's free,
A:	okay.
A:	And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it, see.
B:	Right.
A:	And they told me that my, my brake pads were gosh, you know, seventy percent still good, you know,
A:	but still it was cheaper in the long run
A:	and uh,
A:	so I just got the the brakes done
A:	and I thought that was a good deal.
A:	And plus
B:	Right.
B:	And they repacked the wheel bearings.
A:	and they repacked the the wheel bearings.
A:	Yeah
A:	but, uh, I've, I've had considerable experience.
A:	I'm, you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic
A:	and I, you know, I took auto shop in high school,
A:	it's been a while back,
A:	but I, I still have a pretty good feel for it,
A:	but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars,
A:	I, I had bigger cars
A:	and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those
A:	and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand, I have almost one hundred and ten,
A:	so I drove on those brake pads for, uh, you know, forty-five thousand miles
A:	and there was hardly any wear to them.
A:	So those small little trucks and cars like that, they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good. Exactly,
B:	You know, they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much
B:	and the the surface materials on the pads is so good.
A:	so I, you know, I just did it anyway.
A:	I like to, I like to stay up on it.
A:	You know, like I just kind of stay up on it
A:	and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown.
A:	You know, it's not dirty.
A:	I, I, I keep it that way because that's, that is the key to the longevity.
B:	Right.
B:	Well  it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that
A:	So, so how,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that.
A:	Oh,
A:	oh.
B:	Uh, I, I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car
B:	and, uh  and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I've, uh, beefed up a little bit
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels
A:	Uh-huh
B:	uh, the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were, uh, not even cast aluminum.
B:	They were just pressed aluminum.
A:	You're talking about the vibration dampener?
B:	Well, there's three, there's three pulleys that you change.
B:	You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and, uh, the water pump pulley.
A:	That's the vibration dampener,
A:	yeah.
A:	Okay.
B:	So, when I changed those over, I put on these, these pressed aluminum things
A:	Um.
B:	and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out.
A:	Uh, oh.
B:	So in the process of seizing, the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh, oh.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, I was on my way to work one day
B:	and, uh, the water pump pulley split laterally in half.
B:	So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump
B:	and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and uh, I,
A:	So, the, the topic is hobbies
B:	In your spare time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Who has spare time
A:	Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.
A:	I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that was, oh, good many, many years ago
A:	and I have, I really, my spare time
B:	Yeah.
A:	I usually go do aerobics and read,
A:	and that's,  about it
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I understood that.
B:	I'm, you know, I work full time
B:	and I have two kids
B:	so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, hobbies,
B:	we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.
B:	It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
B:	You know, we like to go out  go out,
A:	Yeah,
A:	family.
A:	Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But as far as,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've just never been very skilled at,  far, you know, needle, work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good
A:	and,
B:	I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.
B:	I've done mostly cross stitching.
B:	I used to, uh, do like, um,
B:	one that I did for both kids are like, oh,
B:	they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals
B:	and then you have their birth date on them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then you have a little picture of them
B:	and you frame them and stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but nothing steady.
B:	Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,
B:	but, you know, it's nothing that I, can really,
A:	It's not, like you sit and knit every night
B:	No.
B:	Not at all.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't even know how to knit
A:	and my mother used to knit, you know,  all the time
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and I don't even know how to knit
A:	I'm like, that's a lost art from this family
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, um,
A:	but, it's not a very good topic
A:	it feels like,  if, you know,
B:	No.
A:	not when you're
A:	neither one of us are really,
A:	I, I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Needlepoint, cushions and things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made
B:	I don't know what, what, is,
B:	it's like there,
B:	but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff
B:	and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
B:	and,  you know, people just do it in their garage
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then on weekends they go out and sell it
B:	and during the week they go back and do some more.
A:	And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,  you know, for us it,
B:	Right
A:	and they make it cheaper for us to buy
B:	Yeah
B:	Definitely.
A:	So,
A:	but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
A:	because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.
A:	It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,
A:	you felt very creative.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it just was so time, time,  involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
A:	and,
B:	Okay
B:	Well, I think, I think we're okay.
B:	I think we did five minutes,
B:	so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore
A:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, thank you.
A:	Okay.
A:	I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Where are you from Tina?
A:	Um, I'm from Maryland
A:	and, um, I have one son who's almost sixteen months old.
A:	Are, are you married, or ...
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You are.
B:	I have, I have two children,
B:	I have a seven year old and a three year old.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, so I try to spend as much time as possible with them.
A:	That's good.
A:	Uh, what kind of things do you do?
B:	Well, um, we do a lot of things with them, you know,
B:	Taylor my youngest is,
B:	or my oldest is in school
B:	and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that.
A:	Oh.
B:	was it a big change in your life, to, uh have a child.
A:	Oh yeah
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	it's really nice, uh,
A:	my husband, uh, is working you know, most of the time.
A:	He's working long hours,
A:	but, uh, I'm staying home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I'm just working a couple days a month,
A:	and, um ...
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	What do you do during those, those days?
A:	Um, we spend a lot of time at the playground
A:	and we go to the zoo,
A:	and we go
A:	and we ...
B:	Well you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	what do, what do you do?
A:	I'm a nurse.
B:	Oh, are you?
A:	So, yeah,
A:	so it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule, you know, to, uh, get in, to, to still stay in with that, an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	He, he's, uh, just now really starting to, to get interested in a lot of things,
A:	so, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I understand that,
B:	yeah.
B:	They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age.
A:	Yeah
B:	But my, my wife was, uh,
B:	she worked part-time when my oldest was, was little
B:	and now she's staying home all the time,
B:	but, uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know,
B:	if you want to do something every night that's fine,
B:	but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore,
B:	so.
A:	That's right,
A:	and I think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that
A:	but still there are so many people that are, you know, have their careers first
A:	and, it's, uh, I think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree with you,
B:	I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way
B:	and I'm really glad she did
B:	and, you know, I'm glad she's staying home,
B:	but, you know, I know there are some days when she she wishes she was back at work.
A:	I know,
A:	That's why I like to to, to work a couple days,
A:	I think it's, uh, it gives me a break.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too,
B:	'cause she worked either two to three days a week
B:	and that got her out of the house
B:	and yet she'd get to spend, you know, three or four days with ...
A:	Most of the time at home,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	and so.
A:	Uh, we had started out like that
A:	and, um, I think that was really ideal, uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do to,
B:	I agree,
B:	but then when you start having two of them, it's, you know, a little bit tougher, because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff.
A:	It's,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's difficult,
A:	but.
B:	Are, are you from the Maryland area?
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I'm, I've, I've lived here forever,
A:	so.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I I live in Germantown,
A:	and, uh.
A:	Are you, where are you from?
B:	Um, uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
A:	In Dallas,
A:	oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, uh, I'm, I've lived here like eight years or so,
B:	my wife's from Fort Worth.
A:	Oh, yea-,.
B:	But,
B:	yeah,
B:	I work for Texas Instruments.
A:	Okay,
A:	oh,
A:	so that explains.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that explains it doesn't it.
A:	Well, um, I don't know,
A:	I, uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	but, uh, as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, uh, you know, just my son and I,
A:	and we're ...
B:	Yeah,
B:	what's your husband do?
A:	Uh, he, he works for Coca Cola.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he, uh, he manages a plant out here,
B:	Oh.
A:	an, and it takes a lot of time.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I'm sure it does.
A:	But, um, it, you know,
A:	we take walks, and go to the library, and try to fill our day with things like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, um.
B:	Yeah,
B:	what, uh,
B:	my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year
A:	Oh.
B:	and so that, that got me to to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff, you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is,
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah
B:	I mean, I I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them,
B:	but, it's so much easier to go to mom,
A:	Right.
B:	I guess they get used to it.
B:	So,
B:	but, you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that,
B:	yeah,
B:	but
A:	That's good,
A:	that's good.
A:	I know my husband was real, uh,
A:	in the beginning when he, uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant
A:	and he, uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, so it takes him a little bit of time.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And I'm not able to work during the week, uh, because of that.
A:	He was, I was working in the evening,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he was coming home
A:	and I, I could go to work,
A:	but, uh, their relationship, uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, uh, really grew.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He, you know,
A:	just the time that they were spending together,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it really does
B:	because I think you know, you grow closer.
B:	Was your, uh, was your husband, I mean naturally a child,
B:	I mean had he been around children,
B:	or ...
A:	Uh, oh yeah,
A:	he has, uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters,
B:	Oh.
A:	and they have, we have thirteen grand,
A:	well his parents have thirteen grandchildren.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it's, uh, you know, there's a lot of kids in the family
A:	and, and he really enjoys it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time,
A:	but ...
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, it's difficult, uh, to do it any other way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I understand.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm, I, you know
B:	it's, it's hard because, you know,
B:	then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home,
B:	I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	that that's a tough situation,
B:	but then, then again, you know, some,
B:	you got to do what you got to do, you know to get along, too,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home
A:	It, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well like I said my wife normally feels that way,
B:	there are days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids,
B:	I'm getting out.
A:	I know
B:	So she's, she's had about enough during those days,
B:	but. But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led,
A:	I know.
B:	the way that, you know,
B:	like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	it has.
B:	And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about,
B:	but I don't know what.
A:	I believe that too,
A:	and I think, uh, the kids are where they need to, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they need to really focus on the children in the in this country.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think?
A:	No,
A:	I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it,
A:	but, um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me,
A:	and, uh, ...
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.
A:	Oh, it, it really does,
A:	I,
A:	just the whole, uh, you know,
A:	seeing how you really are are, are forming this, you know, the mind
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done,
B:	and you see, you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, that's how they're developing their patterns.
B:	And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know.
B:	That's,
A:	Or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into, uh, you know,
B:	Yeah
B:	eventually.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's true.
A:	but it, um,
A:	I, I know,
A:	even just this first year, that I've been with, uh, my son, here, um, he's,
A:	I can just see how much, of, of a difference it makes staying home with him, instead of, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	plus, plus I think it becomes part of part of you too,
B:	I mean, you get to stay home,
B:	I mean it's not just for him,
B:	but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	Well it's been nice talking to you.
A:	Well it's nice talking to you, too.
B:	Okay
B:	good luck.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	good-bye.
B:	Lynn, do you, do you want to start?
A:	Certainly.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um,
B:	Do you want to tell me about vacations you've taken
B:	or,
A:	Well, I, I tend to, uh, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which is your favorite?
A:	Oh, well, I couldn't live without the family vacations,
A:	but, uh, my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, uh, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Your family doesn't live close, then?
A:	Uh, not anymore.
A:	They, uh, they've been in San Diego for the last few years,
A:	and they're moving to Florida.
B:	Okay.
A:	And that's one of those things,
A:	you just have to go once a year.
B:	Yep,
B:	I understand.
A:	So, uh, basically it, it sorts out into that,
A:	and then once, about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back.
B:	Wow.
B:	I've only been there once.
A:	Oh.
B:	and I'd love to go back.
A:	Beautiful country.
A:	Beautiful country,
B:	And it was,
A:	beautiful people.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it,
A:	But, uh,
A:	and I'd real,  really like to go because, um, I'm fairly recently married
B:	we had a great time.
A:	and, and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
A:	and, uh, but he's never met them,
A:	so, uh, I'd like, I'd like to do that.
A:	But anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation,
A:	and, uh, we enjoy the family vacations,
A:	but the other ones are very special getaways,
A:	and we probably take one of each every year.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Well, uh, we, we, as you do, take family vacations, uh, sometimes one a year,
B:	and, but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons.
B:	But vacations we really enjoy,
B:	I think we've been on three cruises.
A:	Oh, I've never, been on a cruise.
B:	And we, we really love cruises.
B:	We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go.
B:	Uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready to go.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we get upgraded.
B:	Last last two times, in fact, we had an outside room
B:	and it was beautiful.
A:	Um.
B:	And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around.
B:	It's kind of,
A:	Well, what do you do on a cruise?
A:	I've never been on a cruise.
B:	Oh, my God, you do everything.
B:	You, I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be.
B:	You can sit in the sun all day around the pool,
B:	or you can take part in the games that they have going on.
B:	They always have bingo.
B:	They have a casino.
B:	Uh, they have a massage parlor.
B:	They have exercise,
B:	I mean, you can do anything.
A:	Huh.
B:	And that's just aboard ship.
B:	And then when the ship docks, you get to go sight-seeing and shopping.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's quite fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And where have you been on these cruises?
B:	Uh, Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas.
B:	We've been there twice.
B:	We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people.
B:	We, we've gone with friends each time.
A:	I see.
B:	And then we went to, uh, the western Caribbean, which is, uh, Port, uh, Cancun, Cozumel,  and Ocho Rios.
A:	Oh, the, the Mexican coast.
B:	Pardon me?
A:	That's all Mexico, I think.
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	And, but it was wonderful.
B:	So we really like those.
B:	And, uh, I guess we just like to go someplace, someplace entirely different.
B:	We've been to a few places in this country.
B:	We still have a lot to see, though.
A:	Where are you from originally?
B:	We're from Illinois originally.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we've been down in Texas eighteen years,
B:	and so, like you, we always try to make it, you know, back home to see the relatives.
B:	We both still have family there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's fun.
B:	It brings back a lot of memories.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Uh, things are different there, though.
B:	They're, uh,
B:	I don't know.
B:	It's just entirely different world than this
A:	Well, I, I grew up in Dallas,
A:	so I mean, it's not, it's not like I'm going home.
B:	Did you?
A:	My, my parents retired first to San Diego,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're going now to Florida,
A:	and so they're going very nice places,
A:	thank God,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know.
A:	I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there.
A:	They've been there eight years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	So it, it is, it is nice,
A:	but it's not home.
A:	This is home,
A:	and, um, and I've never thought about a cruise.
A:	It's so funny.
B:	Oh, they, they, they really are.
B:	We've, yeah, as I said, we've done them three times.
B:	We'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed.
B:	We, we'd probably go.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My husband would, you know,
B:	the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit.
B:	He kind of likes the casinos a little bit.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I like all of that.
A:	What's the best part, from your point of view?
B:	I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I like shopping.
B:	I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever.
B:	Now, my kids are moving to Toronto,
B:	so we're going to be able to go up there.
A:	Oh, that will be nice.
B:	So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	But,
A:	Sure.
A:	Well, go in, don't go in the winter.
B:	Oh, that's what everybody says,
B:	and I, I think it's,
B:	I think I'll try to stay away, except my, my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January.
A:	Oh.
B:	So that will be hard to stay away from.
A:	Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
A:	so,
B:	Isn't that the truth,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Huh. Well, that sounds wonderful.
A:	I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, uh, oh, all circumstances permitting it.
B:	Well, there's all age groups too,
B:	and that's, that's kind of fun.
B:	Uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger,
B:	and everybody is really interesting,
B:	and everybody is there to have a good time
B:	and,
A:	Huh. How long are the cruises?
B:	Uh, we've only gone on the seven day cruises.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They have shorter ones
B:	and then they have ten day ones.
B:	But I think seven days is long enough for us.
B:	By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think most vacations, uh, seven days is enough for us.
B:	We've gone,
B:	I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days,
B:	and that was pushing it a bit.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas
A:	I, go for a long time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that, that makes sense, it really does.
B:	I mean, oh, we went to Panama too.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
B:	Went to Panama last August.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Our son-in-law is from Panama.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents, who live there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And his father is a, a doctor
B:	and his mother is a kindergarten teacher,
B:	and they took time off,
B:	it was their winter
B:	and they were having a little break,
B:	so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around.
B:	And it, it is a beautiful country.
A:	Huh.
B:	It is beautiful.
B:	They have mountains.
B:	We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.
A:	That's really nice.
B:	And it, it is gorgeous.
B:	They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.
B:	Most people don't realize it.
B:	I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably.
A:	Huh. Well, may, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We really hope, hope so.
A:	Well, that, that's really great. Uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents
A:	and, uh,
B:	Well, that, that's, that's pretty good.
B:	That's pretty good.
A:	And, and, uh, we had, my husband had a conference in L A,
A:	so we spent a week in L A
A:	and of course,
B:	Oh, do you like L A?
A:	Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very unusual.
A:	I like,
B:	You ready?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	What have you seen lately?
A:	Well, uh, it's funny, when I tried, to make the call the other days,
A:	I thought,
A:	I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES
A:	but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY.
B:	Oh, I'm dying to see that.
A:	It was really good.
A:	We
B:	Oh.
A:	uh, Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, uh, Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood,
A:	and, uh, we all liked it.
A:	We had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old
A:	and everyone enjoyed it.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Oh, well I am just dying to see it.
B:	I went to dinner with some friends last weekend
B:	and they said get a baby-sitter
B:	and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad.
A:	Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see
B:	Oh.
A:	and so since he had this friend up from Houston, uh, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too.
A:	So, we, uh,  I
B:	Yeah.
A:	finally, it's my first summer movie
B:	Oh my.
B:	Well, let me see.
B:	Was it,
B:	well, we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend
B:	and that may be,
B:	no,
B:	right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,
B:	we're going to the movies.
B:	And we won't,
B:	well she goes all the time
B:	but I go maybe once every couple of months.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And when I go, I go see two at a time.
B:	So we went to see SOAPDISH,
B:	and
A:	Oh, was that good?
A:	Cause,
B:	Oh, hysterical.
B:	We laughed so hard,
B:	it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing   so hard.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both.
A:	I love   comedies.
B:	Yeah
A:	But, that's what I was
B:	that's the other one that we went to that night.
A:	Oh, was it?
B:	And, my face hurt so bad, from laughing because I love Billy Crystal.
A:	Oh
B:	And course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true
B:	and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.
B:	It was so funny.
B:	Both of them were great.
A:	Oh, well good.
A:	I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they,
B:	Oh, they are, are
B:	we just laughed so hard.
B:	And like I said, with CITY I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball
B:	and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Just, they just carried it off, to the tee.
A:	Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S  that was out a couple of years ago.
B:	No.
A:	They had a free showing at the Berkeley, um, United Artist.
B:	How neat.
A:	And, I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend
A:	and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in
A:	but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie.
B:	Shoot,
B:	yeah.
A:	It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.
A:	I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	And the whole theater was hysterical
A:	and it's just, it's just goofy.
A:	I mean, it's, uh,
A:	if you have a chance to rent it, at least,
A:	or it should be out on T V, I would think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it is.
B:	I think it is.
A:	Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy,
A:	make your cheeks hurt laughing.
A:	Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with   everyone laughing.
B:	Oh gosh
B:	I never laughed.
B:	And people were just screaming and applauding
B:	and, you know, it was just hysterical.
A:	Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery
B:	Oh, me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.
A:	Yeah
B:	I mean I'm getting around real good
B:	and I'm just still real sore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And today I was, I, course I went back to work two weeks after, uh
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	but see I don't have permanent work.
B:	I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency.
B:	And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free.
A:	Oh.
B:	Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,
B:	and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.
B:	And I said, yeah,
B:	and I went
B:	and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.
B:	And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week.
B:	And so I went to my doctors last Thursday,
B:	and this was my fourth week checkup
B:	and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well,
B:	I just can't get over this.
B:	He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things.
B:	If you want to play ball, you can go play ball.
B:	He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball
B:	but you can if you want to.
A:	Yeah
B:	And, uh, you know, he was teasing me
B:	and he says, yeah,
B:	you'll be out there waterskiing,
B:	I can just see it now.
B:	And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.
B:	You've only got two more weeks.
B:	I said okay fine, I, I will, I will
B:	Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know.
B:	But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	And so, I don't, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I was, when I'm still sort of on the sore side.
A:	Yeah
B:	But,
B:	well, what's your next,
B:	have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet?
A:	No,
A:	that was one, uh, Jay got to see with a friend
A:	and so I
B:	Uh.
A:	and to try and, uh, try and find time it's hard, uh, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too.
A:	Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,
A:	but knew that, uh,
A:	we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.
A:	We're really enjoying it
A:	but some of the different things we're doing, uh  there's just not a time, enough time to do it all
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he said, well, realistically  You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD.
A:	Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics.
A:	He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big
A:	but the, the fire scenes and the you know  that action part is fantastic.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.
A:	It was real different then you'd expect,
A:	but  but he enjoyed it
B:	Oh really?
A:	and so,
B:	Well I went,
B:	course I am a Kevin Costner fan.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too.
A:	And  yeah,
B:	Supreme.
A:	I really, uh, like him a lot. Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen   for several months
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but,
B:	Gosh, was that wonderful.
A:	It was,
A:	I, uh,
A:	in fact, uh, a friend from Germany was visiting in March
A:	and we wanted, we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to see it.
A:	We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh, I just thought that was terrific.
A:	And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see,
B:	I do, too.
B:	I think he's really good.
A:	And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.
A:	That's not an easy part to play, I, I don't think
B:	I wouldn't think.
B:	Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night
B:	so I sort of think I may go do that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's at, that one won't your sides
B:	Good
A:	Um, it,
A:	was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?
A:	Or,
B:	I
B:	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age begin to
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we went to the,
A:	my number.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	So are you a, a, a golfer
B:	or are you a spectator?
A:	Oh, I'm a,
A:	I play golf
A:	but I don't actually play golf.
B:	Well, I'm the same way.
B:	I,  I go out there and hit the ball.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Hack it all over the place?
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's sickening, isn't it?
B:	Um, uh, well, in the Carolinas it's, it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We've got tons up here
A:	but I don't know.
A:	How do you feel about your game?
A:	I guess that's a good question?
B:	Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all,
B:	uh, uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot
B:	and he drags me out every now and then
B:	and I, uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game.
B:	I usually
B:	when I go out and play golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that, you know, you,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, um, I like watching it on T V.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like that too.
A:	I don't know
A:	I try to play,
A:	but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy.
A:	I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy.
A:	And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come
A:	and then I got worse again
A:	so.
B:	get they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit it up in the air.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I'm pretty bad
B:	but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, across the ground,
B:	and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm,
B:	but I'm getting better.
B:	I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time.
A:	That's pretty good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, so I'm kind of a novice at it.
A:	Um, I'm that and worse.
A:	I, I play
A:	next year I,
A:	actually I take it kind of seriously
A:	but I've been doing so bad.
A:	Next year, I always say this every year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch.
A:	I'm going to go take lessons and everything.
A:	I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not.
B:	Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something.
B:	Because I, my, my tee off is not bad,
B:	I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
B:	it's just, that, that initial tee
A:	Yeah,
A:	what do you do when you're putting?
A:	That's a good thing.
A:	That's something I could learn actually.
A:	That's when I do my worst.
A:	I finally get to the green
A:	and I think I'm doing all, all fine
A:	and then,
B:	Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really,
B:	you know, checking the ground and, and so forth, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	See how it's going to break or whatever.
A:	Can you really see it though?
B:	Yeah.
A:	What about the speed?
B:	If you get, if you get down on the ground you really can.
A:	Can you tell but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit it?
B:	Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it
B:	but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, you know,
B:	because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but you can feel that?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know
A:	I have, I can get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something
A:	but I don't have enough field.
A:	Now I'm T V watching.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They make you die at the hole every time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, it just dies and rolls in.
A:	I don't know,
B:	But I,
A:	it's hard for me.
B:	The, the,
B:	it's, it's like I said
B:	once I get up on the green I'm fine,
B:	but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know,
B:	when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground
B:	so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole
B:	but,
A:	Once you're there, you're all set though.
B:	I'm all set.
A:	We should play team golf then.
A:	I'll get us there
A:	and you put it in.
B:	that sounds good to me.
A:	I
A:	oh, the T V golfers they do that.
A:	It takes them two to get there and two to get it in
A:	so it's fifty percent.
A:	And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in.
B:	Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get it there
B:	and, and then, that's according to the hole
B:	and it
B:	uh, uh, maybe one or two putts.
B:	It's,  according to where I'm at on the green.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's good.
B:	But the friends I play with, uh, they play all the time
B:	and, and they're really good.
A:	Joe Pros?
B:	Uh, they're not Joe Pros
B:	but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies
B:	so I guess they're pretty good
A:	That's pretty good.
A:	For eighteen?
B:	Yeah.
B:	For eighteen.
A:	Wow,
A:	that's pretty good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm talking to the wrong guy.
A:	Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	that's not my golf.
B:	That's my friends.
B:	Mine, mine,
B:	I'm, I'm usually in the eighties or nineties
B:	so I'm, I'm not good
A:	If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good.
A:	I'm usually around a hundred.
A:	That's my thing. Around a hundred.
A:	You know, I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole
A:	but it ain't going to happen.
B:	Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it
B:	or I hook it ever single time
B:	and, and I alternate.
A:	Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time.
A:	That's good.
A:	I aim,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	Universal health insurance,
B:	right?
A:	That's right.
A:	What would we like to say
A:	I think,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's what the subject is about.
B:	Did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?
A:	In the Dallas, the MORNING TIMES?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I guess I did not.
B:	Uh, the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states
B:	and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it. Least according to the article in the paper this morning.
B:	I think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need.
B:	It's getting to a point that you have to have it,
B:	you have to have some form of health insurance.
A:	Well, it's been interesting that we,
B:	Extremely expensive, though.
A:	Yes.
A:	So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it.
B:	Well, that's the thing, you know,
B:	uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance.
A:	Which is why people are talking about
A:	we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't think you, uh,
A:	You have health insurance?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Through your company?
B:	Uh, through my company,
B:	yes.
B:	But I have been in a situation, uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year
B:	and my wife developed cancer.
B:	We didn't have any insurance.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And it was a go to Parkland type situation.
A:	That's must have been hard
A:	How was your care at Parkland?
B:	Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good.
B:	Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland.
A:	But, yet, Parkland is not free, either.
B:	No,
B:	it's not free,
B:	but, uh, It's, it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment, it was paid by the county.
A:	Is it affordable?
A:	So you did have a good experience.
B:	I had a bad experience as it turned out.
B:	Uh, I was fortunate that there was Parkland.
A:	Is your wife better, I hope?
B:	Uh, no she passed away.
A:	I'm real sorry.
B:	That's all right.
A:	Sure. *listen; is this a question?
B:	That happens.
A:	It does happen,
A:	but it's very sad.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but in any event, uh, I'm in favor of national health. If I had to vote for it.
A:	Well so am I.
A:	Actually, uh, I'm a pediatrician
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	and I feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, I'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues.
A:	It's very complex, very complicated,
A:	but, uh, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids basic health benefits.
B:	Well, I, when I grew up and
B:	I grew up in south central Kansas, uh,
B:	we had,
B:	and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department
B:	and we had x-rays every year,
B:	we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least.
B:	Uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff.
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that.
B:	We had to pay for it, which I wasn't opposed to paying for it.
B:	I had the money to pay for it,
B:	but I'm sure that there were people that don't.
A:	Well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much.
A:	The cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal the legal benefits, uh,
A:	that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, well, I don't know,
A:	it's, it is interesting,
A:	in case you didn't know, Texas leads the nation in uninsured children.
A:	Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid.
B:	Did not know that.
A:	So, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care.
A:	And I work in the children's Parkland system
A:	and it's pretty overwhelming to me.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county.
B:	Okay,
B:	so now what are your opinions on recycling?
A:	Well, I definitely think that we need to start recycling.
A:	I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until,
A:	I think if we wait, uh, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have heard that too.
A:	And that is not too far away,
A:	but I don't know how it is there.
A:	It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much.
A:	I take, my paper,
A:	I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
A:	and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to
A:	and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.
B:	Well see, I started saving newspapers
B:	and I would take a ton of them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, that's, I can't remember where I went to take them,
B:	but they wouldn't take them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is real hard to find a spot
A:	and then, I don't know if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is incredible
A:	bottles
B:	Oh I know.
A:	glass
A:	that cannot be, it could be recycled,
A:	but there is no place to,
B:	There is no really recycling facilities.
A:	No.
A:	We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out.
B:	I think that is a good idea.
A:	And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.
B:	Besides, well like a law or whatever.
B:	that's how it is in New York isn't it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think so,
A:	just because they have to. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you get ticketed if you don't do it right.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the,
A:	it's, It's trouble for me to do what I do
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I am willing to do it
A:	but,
B:	Plus you have to have a place to store all of it
A:	Yeah.
B:	and see I live in an apartment.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is very difficult.
A:	Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
A:	and, so, I don't know.
A:	I think there needs to be more places
A:	and also I have a real strong opinion.
A:	In Iowa, the state I am from uh, I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then you take it back to the store
A:	and you get it back.
B:	Uh, so that way it kind of forces you to recycle.
A:	You are forced to.
A:	And, uh, you also don't see the litter there.
A:	People just,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	It makes it worthwhile to take it back
A:	and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian,
A:	I don't know if you've tried it
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have seen them.
A:	and they have on the it's five cents, that they pay five cents
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it even shows the states that,
B:	That take them back.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, some of them are five, some are ten cents.
A:	I am looking at it right now.
B:	Is Texas one of them?
A:	Texas is not one of them see.
A:	So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think that there is enough being done.
B:	Now, I work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we have a paper recycling program that, uh, is company wide
B:	and I do the recycling for that.
A:	Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Good.
A:	Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And I know there is a lot of computer paper that you can't use.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, we use to have, uh,
B:	I mean, I don't even remember how much money that they've, uh, I mean, the money that they've made from the recycling program.
B:	They have donated it to charities.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage
A:	like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton
B:	Yeah.
A:	you add
A:	well, I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later,
A:	but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I want them to have my business.
A:	And I think packaging could be done much better.
A:	There is so much plastic.
A:	But,
B:	Well I know,
B:	you see some of the stuff
B:	and then when they come out with the new things, you are like, well why didn't you think of that before.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I think that it's just people have got to be aware.
A:	Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care
A:	and they don't want to think about it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	And, uh, I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something.
A:	You know, I want to feel like I at least tried.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I don't know.
A:	It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it.
A:	Then we will be forced to.
A:	It may be too late.
B:	Do they not ever, I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,
A:	Very little.
A:	That's another thing that,
A:	see there were no,
B:	Then, that's pollution.
A:	I know Amway.
A:	I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material.
A:	Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know.
B:	I guess you run into the pollution factor.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And there is no place I can take glass to.
B:	Uh,
A:	So, I still throw away a lot of glass.
B:	It is really sad.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then the packaging thing really grips me.
A:	You buy some
A:	and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic,
B:	Well, uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, uh, very specific in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing.
A:	Well.
B:	Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many,
B:	I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us.
B:	I really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,
B:	and I, personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, I guess I basically agree that, uh,
A:	do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs?
A:	I mean suppose they found out some other way?
B:	Well, I think, I think we, I think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	There's too many cases where it can, you know,
B:	there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing.
B:	I don't think there's any definitive, you know,
B:	okay this person is taking drugs,
B:	so we don't want him here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,
B:	I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that, that it's such a, a big deal.
B:	I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you
B:	or, you know, it,
B:	I just, I think it's a whole trust issue.
B:	I just can't see it.
A:	But, have you ever been in a situation where you, you were drug tested
A:	or,
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I have been.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I.  I mean, I was very offended by, by the whole process.
A:	I once too,
A:	so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean it's very humiliating,
B:	and, I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,
B:	but I, uh, I am totally against that sort of a, uh,
B:	I mean it's, it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I had it during a job interview,
A:	and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to, to want to work for them to do this,
B:	Right.
A:	and I'm just like, well, uh, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	That's, that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know,
B:	I did, I, I was in the same sort of situation as,
B:	it was a job interview
B:	and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested,
B:	and it's,
B:	I just,
B:	and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know,
B:	I really.
B:	The other side of it is, is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, as in my, it's my bodily fluid
B:	and I don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work.
B:	I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say this is, these behaviors are acceptable and these are not,
B:	but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really what people ought to be doing, I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons.
B:	That's exactly right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And also I just think it, it gets a lot,
B:	I'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,
B:	and I think that it just moves down along a line that, that I really would find bad if, if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,
B:	there's already talk of people,
B:	well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke.
B:	Well, you know, I, I can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke,
B:	but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all.
A:	Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this
A:	or,
B:	Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or, or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And other than that I think, I do not think it should be allowable.
B:	I think it should be illegal for them to, to want to do that.
B:	It should, it's kind of the big brother syndrome,
B:	I mean, I just,
B:	anything like that just kind of scares me.
A:	I tend to, to view it,
A:	even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an uh, in addition to an individual's rights,
A:	but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
B:	Right.
A:	and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, and I don't really,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	I thought it was supposed to give a recording,
A:	but anyway, uh, well, I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for, for my wife and for me
A:	and uh, I, embarrassed to say, it's pretty trivial.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	All we, all I do is, uh, keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month,
A:	but I doubt I do it more than three times a year.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	do you use a computer?
A:	And,
A:	No,
A:	I work with them all day,
A:	I'm in computer science,
A:	yet I I do everything on paper
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	mine is really simple, because I got all our bills paid off when, uh, he was a Marine,
B:	he went to Saudi Arabia
B:	and while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off,
B:	so really the only bills I have is rent, utilities, insurance you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so they come in,
B:	I pay them,
B:	and that's it you know,
B:	that's about the extent of it, you know.
A:	Yeah
A:	that,
B:	I don't really have this major budget or anything.
B:	I just really, I'm real thrifty.
B:	I take care of, you know, two children and me and uh, just real careful with the money, you know. What little we have
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, that's what I do.
A:	Yes,
A:	it's pretty straightforward.
A:	It's
A:	I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know, fancy budgets.
B:	No.
A:	It seems like if you're getting to that level, you're not in real good control.
B:	Uh-uh.
B:	You know, I mean, I, I, I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt, you know,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	you buy something on credit
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you pay twice as much for it when you get done. You know
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,
A:	Actually, I mean, I like using credit cards for everything, but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month.
B:	I don't have too many, I don't have too many weaknesses,
B:	but I found out a credit card was one of them. You know,
A:	Uh.
B:	it's so much easy, easier, you know, if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person,
B:	it's like, oh, it's on sale,
B:	let's go grab it, you know
B:	so, uh, and if you don't have the money, then use a credit card,
B:	so, I got rid of them credit cards. You know.
A:	Yeah, I guess if that's if that's a weakness, that's a good thing to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was my weakness
B:	It wasn't bad,
B:	I mean, I didn't have like thousands of dollars, you know, and like that,
B:	just, I just learned that that wasn't for me, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	So, but I, self-employed, you know,
B:	I have my own little cleaning business type thing,
B:	so, uh, I keep,
A:	Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	it's not hard,
B:	I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and, uh, you know, what it's going to have to go for that month
B:	and you know, it's not that, not that hard. Not at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's good to know.
B:	So, I always do my own income tax, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you?
A:	I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to, to do it.
B:	Huh?
A:	It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it.
B:	all you got to do is read a book, I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go.
A:	I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	just the form.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, it seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just to get someone to,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and a lot of them.
B:	it's dumb
B:	I guess if you had some really complicated stuff,
B:	but I don't,
B:	so, I don't mess with it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, I don't use a calculator either, you know
A:	I, I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer, too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that, that I, I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on.
B:	I don't, I don't have that that many, you know, things to add up
B:	so,
A:	I know too many people who use a calculator
A:	if they make a mistake, they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And,  And it seem,
B:	And we have a,
B:	I bank at N C N B here
B:	and they have a number that you can call in,
B:	and I always call in and, like, once every other week or so
B:	and I will, uh, check off what checks have cleared
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you do that?
A:	We have the same thing.
B:	You do too?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I always check them off and, you know, check my balance and my book and, you know, because I always want to know exactly what I have, you know.
A:	Sure.
B:	I do that real often.
B:	I do that,
B:	so anyway,
A:	Okay,
A:	so, what are, what are your views on capital punishment?
B:	I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is.
B:	But, on the other hand, it is very, very expensive to maintain,
B:	you know, Texas has one of biggest criminal justice systems in the country.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it's eating us alive budget wise
B:	and, uh,
A:	So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do practice capital punishment,
B:	but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's similar to Georgia.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And then, I was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because I had forgotten, I guess, that I wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.
A:	That's probably true considering,
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,
B:	Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right,
A:	that would be the intent of it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I'm not sure how successful that is.
A:	Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals.
B:	Quicker  maybe,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What, what kind of work do you do?
A:	Uh, I'm a research engineer,
A:	I work, uh, with Georgia Tech.
B:	Um, well, see, I'm a school principal.
A:	Um.
B:	Elementary school.
A:	Yes.
B:	And in a very poor section of town with predominantly Anglo kids.
B:	And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
A:	Um.
B:	and, see, I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that,
B:	I mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids,
B:	we'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road, you know.
A:	Um, that's probably true,
A:	but I guess there's other factors that,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,
B:	Well I'm not talking about just in the school system.
A:	but it's not going to,
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	See, I'm talking about,
B:	like, in, in,
B:	uh, I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared.
B:	Uh, I know the institutions don't work that well,
B:	but a bad day because I all these kids through my office.
B:	I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Five hundred of them are good, solid kids
B:	and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.
A:	Um.
B:	And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible.
B:	Some of them in the penal system.
A:	So that's a difficult situation.
B:	And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.
B:	Now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment,
B:	but some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing,
A:	Um.
B:	and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals,
B:	and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system,
B:	I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh,
B:	and some of them are our problems,
B:	but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But that's another subject
B:	but,
A:	Well, that's probably true.
B:	Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	I guess that's not an easy solution.
A:	There's, there's no easy solution for that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't know that there is an easy solution,
B:	but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and I'm not sure what it would be. It would be money better spent than,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard?
B:	That's true.
A:	I'm sure it is,
A:	yeah.
B:	Statistically, that's true.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	I don't, I don't,
A:	certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but,
B:	Are you for it?
A:	Uh,
B:	I'm for it in  in some cases.
A:	I guess I am  for certain
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah,
A:	in certain crimes.
B:	What kind of crimes would you use it for?
A:	Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	any mass murderer type individual.
B:	I, I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, you always have castration
B:	Well, you know, somebody elected that recently.
A:	Yes,
A:	I read about that
B:	And all the civil rights people are up arms about it, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, um, I used to work in a day care center.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center
A:	and it is, they can be deceiving to people.
A:	I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got,
A:	and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three, um, centers,  all over, you know, the, um, city
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they would, um, be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, um, I think you need to make, you know, if you do, do day care centers, you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when they're not expecting it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because they do, do things differently when you're not around,
A:	so.
B:	Well that,
B:	I know
B:	the things that we kind of looked at is, is you want to see how many teachers you have. And, and how many kids they have and how they break it up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Because we had, we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, it was a really good one,
B:	and in fact, it worked out for us because my wife, we kind of bartered.
B:	My wife did artwork for them
B:	and then, you know, so we got our day care free.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they didn't have enough teachers
B:	and,
A:	Well, this one was set up good.
A:	I mean they had two teachers to every room. Um, sometimes three.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they had a good system like so when you walked in, everything looks cool.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough.
A:	They did not show them care to these small children who are being left.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, they,
A:	one time I picked up this little boy who was crying
A:	and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. You know,
B:	Huh.
A:	he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up.
A:	And I said, no,
A:	this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	what is your problem.
A:	So, um,
B:	Did, did they separate them by age group?
A:	Yes.
B:	Because I'd think, you know, I think that's one thing that was important.
A:	Right.
A:	They did, they had like, um, the, the crawlers, the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Then they had like the, um, three, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower fives. You know, just like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, they really did separate them well.
B:	it sound,
B:	yeah,
A:	It was just the teachers themselves.
A:	Right.
A:	But,
A:	yeah,
A:	that they're not,
B:	Affectionate people that they're, they're kind of  may be parents themselves or something.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Their system,
A:	Right.
A:	But their, but their system was, was great
A:	but, um, the, you know, the caring just wasn't there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her
A:	and she was fabulous.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She loved them babies,
A:	and she loved them and cared for them.
A:	But, um, every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,
A:	so, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,
B:	but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	these kids are just in a day care center all day and, uh, with no, any type of emotional, you know, getting love, getting care,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they're just there. You know. Going through this routine,  which is lousy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The other, the other group that we had was kind of interesting.
B:	The other one we went to the, it was a husband and wife team
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we knew them from other associations
B:	but, uh, it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one,
B:	and I think, you know, she would, she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, you know,
B:	but he was actually the more, um, the more, uh, what, demonstrative type. The more loving
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids
B:	and and it was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the man in the group that, that did that side of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you don't see that much.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so they had a really nice balance.
B:	We liked that one.
B:	In fact, it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,
A:	That's cute.
B:	but they also did, they also did some of the teaching things
B:	and then they had, um, you know,
B:	obedience, obedience was important.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that has to be with a day care center.
B:	And you know so they, you know, they used, uh, oh, I think they used the,
B:	you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself.
A:	I've never heard of that.
A:	That's, that's a new one,  on me.
B:	And it's, it's one,
B:	Uh, I can't remember what they call it actually
B:	but you just stand them in front of a clock
B:	and, you know, it has a second-hand that goes around.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they have to stand there,
A:	Um, what's our topic?
B:	Taxes.
A:	Taxes.
B:	Do we pay too much?
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Um
B:	Well, do we?
A:	What do you do?
B:	Um,
A:	I guess that,
A:	I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
B:	My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there.
B:	I pay the, I generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I think that we're paying too much
B:	because I don't have any children.
A:	Right.
B:	And I pay a lot of property taxes.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services.
B:	It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just,
B:	sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
A:	Right.
B:	How about you?
B:	Do you pay too much?
A:	Uh, well, no,
A:	I can't really complain.
A:	I'm a student, um,
A:	and I I work as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute.
A:	And, uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes
A:	and, uh, and, uh,  one of my parents is still claiming me.
B:	Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.
A:	Huh?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm sure
B:	Um, you look at your paycheck
B:	and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go
B:	Um, what kind of, what kind of,
B:	uh, well have you pay a lot of in
B:	have you been out working and then gone back to school
B:	or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?
A:	I went,
A:	well I did work, um, just very for some time
A:	but I didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a difference.
B:	To worry about it.
A:	Right.
B:	Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this?
B:	Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I haven't.
B:	I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, uh, in D C area, um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress,
B:	um, Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, you know,
B:	there's a bank that they all bank with,
B:	and I guess it went defunct recently.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
A:	Huh.
B:	And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no interest, no repayment schedule.
A:	Oh.
A:	Really?
B:	And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because we're so close to D C anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Um, I, I, I think we pay too much.
B:	And I've, I look at my paycheck
B:	and I make,
B:	well, let's see.
B:	They take out in state and federal taxes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think I pay forty-two percent.
A:	Wow.
B:	Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,
B:	and then they charge me sales tax
B:	and they charge me gasoline taxes,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	taxes.
B:	and they charge me all these others,
B:	and it's just too expensive.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't believe that
B:	I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for.
A:	Huh.
B:	You know what I mean?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I haven't.
A:	Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition.
A:	So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.
B:	What are you studying down there?
A:	Physics.
B:	Physics.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field.
A:	Everybody says that
B:	Scientific.
A:	Huh.
B:	Heavy science.
B:	Are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that
B:	or is it more, um, applied physics?
A:	Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet.
A:	Actually, um, the, the degree I'm getting is physics.
A:	There's a different one for applied physics
A:	so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.
A:	I doubt about that.
A:	Are, are, is America, I mean are we pretty, pretty steep compared to most countries?
B:	Actually, I don't think we are.
A:	No,
A:	I don't think so either.
B:	Um, like, like Europe,  um, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, um, they're talking,
B:	or maybe it was on the
A:	I don't think anybody pays too little.
B:	No,
B:	I would tend to agree very highly.
B:	I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it.
A:	Do you get hit up for local taxes there?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we sure do.
B:	Here in Indiana we pay, uh, we pay county income tax, state income tax,
B:	we pay five percent sales tax,
B:	uh, you name it, they tax it.
A:	Oh, so you get the whole smorgasbord.
B:	That's right
B:	we,
A:	Well, I, I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die. Uh-huh
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Which is probably pretty nice,
B:	but I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high.
A:	No,
A:	actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either.
B:	There's no sales tax either?
A:	No,
A:	what there is, is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The only problem is I work in Massachusetts,
A:	so they they hit me up for the five percent there.
B:	Right.
B:	Taxachusetts
A:	Yep,
A:	but, it,
A:	well, you know, we,
A:	it's only a state tax here, no local.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	got a five percent sales tax.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, the problem is that so I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here.
B:	Right.
A:	But, at least on things like stock options and things like that, they don't tax me.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that's not too bad.
B:	No,
B:	I, uh, I really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay a, a whole, uh, just too much tax.
B:	I worked in a factory, uh, last summer
B:	and, on the average, I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
B:	and I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that.
B:	I mean, I don't utilize all, you know, it really, any government welfare services.
B:	Of course, I drive on the roads
B:	and I, you know, went to the schools and stuff,
B:	but I really feel that, that I'm just getting overtaxed.
A:	Oh, I, I mean, I, I'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on, I mean, you know, when you figure out just on feds, you know, I actually hit the thirty-one bracket  this year, which was no fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No
B:	that's, that's not any fun.
A:	Right,
A:	and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	most people forget about them, because you've you know, you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year.
B:	Right.
A:	But, so, you know, and then, you know, like a five percent surtax, I'm paying forty percent tax.
B:	Yeah,
B:	which is just outrageous
B:	and a lot of it,
B:	and if you look at the way the government is run these days, it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I, I mean, I think there's some people, there, certainly are some things where you need infrastructure
A:	and you need you you know,
B:	Right.
A:	things government does better, you know,
A:	I government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals,
B:	Right.
A:	but, you know, I think, you know, you look at things like, you know, tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way
B:	Right
A:	or, You know, and, and just tremendous amounts of, you know,
B:	That's right,
B:	got to keep those farmers happy.
A:	so much of it, is now just going to service debt or you know, is going in, into, into programs that, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	yeah,
A:	they are, they are a fat.
A:	You know, I think the military is really fat.
A:	I think that a lot of the, the H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them.
B:	Right.
B:	there is just way too much bureaucracy
B:	and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running, keep the paper shuffling around instead of real, you know, good programs.
A:	You know, like we,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, we, we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals
A:	and, you know, then you look at how well they're managed, you know,
A:	I don't think we're getting our money's work out, worth out of there.
A:	I think it's all going into, into bureaucrats.
B:	Right,
B:	and a lot of it's feeding that.
B:	Just, I just, I really, especially in the election year, I mean, I'm really thinking a lot about this, the economy and questions like that and, and just the whole,
B:	it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy, uh, the government goes and our, our whole economy in general
B:	and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens
B:	and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures, uh, beyond what any other President since World War Two has done
B:	and yet he supposedly,
A:	Well, between him and Reagan,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right
B:	right,
B:	yeah.
A:	great
B:	I mean, I just read something that, two thirds or three quarters, I'm not exactly sure of our national debt are, was created during the Reagan Bush era  who are supposedly fiscally conservative.
A:	Oh, oh, yeah,
A:	they think,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	and then they go I'm not
A:	Congress, they're the fault for it.
B:	Right
A:	But, you know, the other thing is, it's tricky, though,
A:	because like in New Hampshire, they say, oh, all right, let's cut the military budget.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	then, you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you lose,
A:	Connecticut goes,
A:	so, you know, it's like, you know, it's very tricky to balance off, because then you hurt, you know,
A:	if the, if the, if people lose their jobs, then they become a load
A:	and they're not contributing taxes.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, you know, it's, it's very hard to say, you know, this is what we should cut.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really,
B:	that is the,
B:	especially that defense, cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy, because like you say, if you cut defense, well, that's great,
B:	that's going to lower our national expenditures,
B:	but then you're going to have people on welfare
B:	and they're not  putting taxes in.
A:	Who aren't contributing.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	So that's, that's really,
B:	it's,
A:	And, uh, in our,
B:	I'm glad I'm not the one who has to come up with these policies.
A:	Right.
A:	But, what's very funny is in our town meeting they were
A:	this, this guy had, both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which, unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution for our local town to do it to, uh, have you, have people line item their taxes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this.
A:	Course, the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use.
B:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	the one will take,
A:	uh, okay,
A:	let's see,
A:	I guess, uh, I can start.
A:	I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing.
B:	Are you really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have.
A:	We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon.
A:	So, I'm looking for something, uh, littler  bigger,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	which are both kind of small.
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while
A:	and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Are you looking for an American car
B:	or, you open to buying foreign cars?
A:	Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's, you know, it,
A:	I guess the American cars had a bad reputation
A:	but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,
B:	and I really like it a lot.
B:	Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,
B:	but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,
B:	but I would also look at American cars,
B:	but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also
B:	and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, even if it's just details, it seems like, uh they, you know,
B:	So, if I were,
B:	Right.
A:	I
A:	there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal
A:	and you have to take it back every once in a while.
A:	It's clearly just a, a design problem there.
B:	Right,
B:	it is.
B:	Uh, I'm kind of,
B:	right now,
B:	the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car.
B:	I would really like to have a sports car.
B:	Uh I don't really, I don't have a family,
B:	so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,
A:	Oh, like a Miata or something like that?
B:	Well, I like the Miata,
B:	but I don't like it enough to buy it.
B:	I would buy something,
B:	actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car.
A:	Um.
B:	But, uh, something along that lines.
B:	Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,
B:	but uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better.
A:	Yeah.
A:	interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.
B:	Right.
A:	Probably,
B:	Right.
A:	Uh,
B:	That's,
B:	when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage,
B:	and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah
A:	I I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and things like that.  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	but it, you know depends on what you, what you pay initially.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger.
B:	That's right.
A:	Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's, you know,
A:	we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,
A:	but uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, But, uh,
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think,
B:	and, and they were okay.
B:	I had a Pontiac once
B:	and, and I never had a problem with it,
B:	but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point
B:	and I, I had driven it a few times
B:	and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge just from,
A:	Um.
B:	well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	But,
A:	yeah,
A:	it, it's hard to beat some of the,
A:	uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction,
A:	but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,
B:	Which is a good deal.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because I guess, uh,
A:	I mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,
B:	Right.
A:	so all the depreciation has been taken off
A:	and, the dealer comes out okay you know,
B:	Yeah
B:	that,
A:	don't what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it,
A:	but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
A:	and So, but, uh, I don't know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm sure they did.
A:	we keep looking at that mini van.
A:	It's just, you know,
A:	we can get a, like a Caravan for, twelve, five
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.
A:	But, uh, uh, it's interesting,
A:	but, uh, I don't know,
A:	if, if, uh, it seems to be,
B:	Well, Julie, uh, are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with, uh, special care for elderly?
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	My grandfather is ninety-two years old.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he is still living by himself.
A:	My grandmother died a couple of years ago
A:	But he doesn't want to, to move away.
A:	He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he recently had to have an operation
A:	but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home.
B:	Is he able to, uh, still do everything himself pretty well?
A:	Well, he was until this operation.
A:	He has arthritis.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And now I don't really think he's doing that well.
A:	And my, a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him.
A:	And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather's feelings.
B:	Because, uh, I you know, I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left.
B:	And  and, for, for, I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm just here for the rest of the stay
B:	And so I, you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs.
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they have can look after a lot of things
B:	but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore.
B:	Uh, I know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home.
B:	They generally were able to have someone care for them at home
B:	and they died
B:	But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents
B:	Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing
B:	Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess,
B:	uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do, take care of themselves physically. Uh
A:	But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.
B:	And that's, that's difficult part.
B:	Because I think what they often get used as is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for, uh, similar to a hospital.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I know, like here in Saskatchewan, we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level, in four levels.
B:	And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally are not able to look after themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically
B:	Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. Uh, you know, where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind Even though  it may be minimal
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, but I think that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care they need. Uh,
A:	But I don't, I mean
A:	at least, I mean I think some nursing homes do that.
A:	But I think a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I and I think it happens more in areas where it's, uh, I guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing.
B:	If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals
B:	and, and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding.
B:	I think that a majority of the places in the U S, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,
B:	but the majority is to the availability of the individual to pay
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, if you're not able to look after yourself, then you have to rely,
A:	Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like, uh, you know, three or four years ago.
A:	I'm a senior in, in, uh, college now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I can't really talk too much about the problems with, uh, public education in detail because the school system I went to was, uh, really superb even though it was a public school  system.
B:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	I feel that my, uh,
B:	I'm a junior in college now.
B:	And  I go to Tech, Georgia Tech?
A:	Oh.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I,
A:	I got a friend who goes there, by the way
A:	I want to talk to you about that afterward,
A:	okay.
B:	Okay
B:	Uh, I've,
B:	the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also.
B:	And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools.
B:	Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	That, that was true for mine too.
A:	Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity,
A:	but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.
A:	You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.
B:	What
A:	And, uh  you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	I mean  know
B:	Yeah.
B:	And I'm also
B:	I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know, in areas where they
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read.
A:	Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable
A:	and you can't really,
A:	I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But these people obviously weren't.
B:	That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow,
B:	well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area
B:	but I still, I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably.
A:	I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,
B:	So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, again, I don't, I mean
A:	got know the, you know, how qualified, I mean,
A:	I think it'd be interesting to, you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school.  You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that'd be an interesting experience.
A:	But, uh, I haven't done that
B:	No,
B:	I, I can't say that I have either.
B:	But, uh,
A:	But I do, I do think that, uh, I mean, public education in general I think can work.
A:	And I think it's a good thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools.
A:	Yes.
B:	I think they compare you know, fairly well.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I don't, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in. mean
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there,
B:	I have a lot of
B:	once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That, I mean, that makes a big difference
B:	cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, and and in the,
A:	once you junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels.
A:	Well, no,
A:	I guess it in junior high, it was still three.
A:	Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. Uh, which,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, actually I think that works pretty well.
A:	and that, that makes,
A:	Okay
B:	How are you?
B:	You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I, I feel like, uh, I am from Mars.
A:	I mean I'm fifty years old
A:	and, uh, I've been divorced for, um, eighteen years.
A:	But I've two kids and all.
A:	But I, uh, I, I've never had a budget
A:	and I don't, uh, do any planning
A:	and I don't know,
A:	I don't, uh, uh, I don't have a long-term financial plan.
A:	I don't try to control my expenses.
A:	But I'm, I'm glad you're a stranger.
B:	That sounds kind of like me.
A:	But, really, I'm, I happy, I, I, well I'm curious how other people live.
A:	Uh, so maybe we should start with you
A:	What do you do?
B:	About the same thing.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
A:	Maybe they're going to arrest us both.
B:	I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children
B:	and, uh, we live from hand to mouth
B:	We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not, then we due for the next month.
A:	Wow.
B:	A couple of times we've tried some things
B:	and they worked
B:	but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and, uh, took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
A:	Yeah.
B:	and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money.
B:	And we did that pretty successfully for about three months
B:	and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope
B:	and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do.
A:	Huh. The, uh,
A:	I had a part-time job around, oh gosh, fifteen years ago, seventy-six,
A:	and, uh, uh, this was a sort of a career shift at the time
A:	and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that.
A:	And I actually did,
A:	my bank account would, uh,
A:	I'd, I, I kept bouncing checks, just at the end of the month
A:	but I, I had miscalculated.
A:	I, well I didn't keep a balance
A:	It's one of the problems this very
A:	I never had to in the past.
A:	I always kept plenty of money in my checking account,
A:	but when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money, I sometimes I sometimes would just,
A:	things would get to tight.
A:	Uh, and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
A:	and every time I, uh, I spent money, I mean cash mostly, I would, uh, write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I would forget to write the things down
A:	and it, that I, I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data.
A:	I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.
B:	I even find now like with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then I forget to take that out of my checking account.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I, I, I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that, so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The, uh,
A:	I, I have to say that,
A:	let's see, at this point on, I don't run out of money.
A:	Uh, and it, uh,
A:	and I don't, I mean
A:	someday, if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have
A:	and I, I, I think my strategy if, if I may, is to, is to not spend money.
A:	I mean I don't have expensive tastes.
A:	I don't go out.
A:	I mean I buy a car,
A:	well the last car I got rid of I'd had,
A:	it was nineteen years old.
B:	Yeah.
A:	people were embarrassed for me.
A:	I mean it was, it was a good car
A:	and,
B:	it still running.
A:	Oh, it was great.
A:	My, my mechanics loved it because it was an old, it was a sixty-five Buick
A:	and it just wouldn't stop.
A:	Uh, and it,
A:	I, I just didn't feel the need for a new car.
A:	It isn't like I couldn't afford one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and now, I mean I, I don't, uh,
A:	I tend to eat expensive food.
A:	I mean I don't mind buying a good steak
A:	but for me, I only do that every week or, without even, I mean, maybe once a month.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean you buy a, a tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, like twelve dollars a pound.
A:	You buy a, a, less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars.
A:	To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that.
B:	Not very often
A:	But, but I'm just, I'm just saying as a single person, that's, that's a drop in the bucket.
A:	And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it doesn't add up. If you're buying, I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, so that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have, I don't, I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that expensive thing.
B:	lot
A:	You want to go first?
B:	No,
B:	you can start
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I really don't agree with that
A:	I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible.
A:	I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.
B:	Right.
A:	you know what I mean?
B:	Right.
B:	There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	there, there's no way.
B:	We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
A:	That's it.
B:	Uh, every person has their opinions
B:	and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.
A:	Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh,
A:	they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system.
A:	I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal,
A:	I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
B:	Right.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt.
A:	You know, all these things.
A:	I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
B:	Right.
B:	They shouldn't allow an appeal.
A:	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
B:	Yep.
A:	I, I think this is a little ridiculous.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Well, I have a V C R
A:	and I see most all of mine there.
A:	What have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
B:	Uh, I don't know, um,
B:	actually earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A.
B:	Have you seen that movie?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't.
B:	It's a kind of one of those psycho ones.
A:	Now, I, I live alone.
A:	Consequently, I don't like these psycho things.
B:	Oh, it's not too bad.
B:	One of those cop thrillers
B:	but,
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Have you seen the
A:	if,
A:	do you have a V C R?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
A:	Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I haven't yet.
A:	I saw it this weekend
A:	and it is, uh, to me an outstanding movie.
A:	I thoroughly enjoyed it.
A:	He is, uh, an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
A:	and she has a suit against his company.
A:	You know, it's one of those things.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that,
A:	But there's a lot of
A:	well, it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy.
B:	He's a good actor though.
A:	Beg your pardon?
B:	Um, Gene Hackman's a good actor.  I think.
A:	Yes,
A:	he is.
B:	Do you see HOOSIERS?
A:	Yes.
A:	I've seen HOOSIERS.
A:	Saw it just again the other night, for,
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually I, we saw her just the other night too.
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's one of our favorite movies.
B:	I, I live with, um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us.
B:	We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.
A:	Have you seen the movie, um, CROSSING DELANCY?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now, that's one I have watched, oh, six or eight times.
A:	I always feel so good when I get through with that movie.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like those movies that you watch time and time again.
A:	I do too.
A:	DIRTY DANCING and CROSSING DELANCY are two of my favorite.
A:	So, well what business are you in?
B:	I'm, I'm an electrical engineer.
A:	Oh.
A:	In New Hampshire.
A:	All right.
B:	I work in Massachusetts actually.
A:	Oh, all right.
A:	Okay.
A:	So is everything going all right up there?
B:	Um, it's only about, um, half an hour.
B:	I live on the border.
A:	Oh, well that's that bad then.
A:	Half an hour, we do that just going to downtown Dallas.
B:	That's right.
A:	So,
B:	See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work.
A:	That makes a lot of sense
A:	But, um, we,
A:	are you a native of that part of the country?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I grew up in New Hampshire.
B:	It seems, southern town,
B:	it's called
B:	It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the border and five minutes from the main border. *main = Maine?
B:	We live right in the corner.
A:	Oh.
B:	That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,
B:	I live on one of that little ten mile spot.
A:	Uh, sounds wonderful.
A:	Did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
B:	Not up, um, where I live
B:	but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.
A:	I happened to be in Nassau
A:	and we got the backlash of that thing.
A:	And they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,
A:	and it was quite an experience
A:	so.
A:	Well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?
B:	Um, well, I'm, I'm only twenty-seven years old
B:	so THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that.
A:	Okay.
A:	Have you seen GREEN CARD?
B:	That would be pretty good.
B:	No,
B:	I haven't seen that one.
A:	That's a real warm movie.
A:	It, it really just turned out nicely.
A:	So I would recommend that if you have a chance.
B:	I'm in for it.
B:	We rent a lot of movies
B:	so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent?
B:	And we don't know.
A:	Well if you, if you can get GREEN CARD, go for it.
B:	All right,
B:	we'll try that one.
A:	I have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas
A:	and I have watched, uh, GROSS ANATOMY.
A:	Have you seen that one?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did.
A:	Okay.
A:	And I don't know
A:	I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school.
A:	But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas.
B:	You too.
A:	I'm looking forward to it.
B:	I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.
A:	Well,
A:	Uh, well, uh, to begin,
A:	I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,
A:	so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree
A:	Uh.
B:	it's definitely new frontier stuff.
A:	So, uh,
A:	but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space frontier,
A:	but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.
A:	Um, Star Wars is not too far I don't think.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time.
A:	Oh, have you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So what do you know about it.
B:	Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.
B:	I get on a computer network all the time,
B:	and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.
B:	They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,
B:	it's like they, take off, you know,
B:	and then they land, with the, with the, you know,
B:	the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad.
A:	Really.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's called V C X or something like that.
B:	Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that.
A:	Wow.
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Do you,
B:	I think I would.
B:	I think that'd be neat.
A:	I think I would just sitting here talking about it,
A:	but if the time came, it'd be real nervous.
A:	I'd be scared,
A:	scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.
A:	That'd be pretty hairy.
B:	Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,
B:	so you know, I, like I know what it's like to
A:	Yeah,
A:	imagine.
B:	Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're talking about doing that again, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.
B:	Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they're going to put,
A:	That's all beyond my imagination really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, science fiction books,
A:	I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons,
A:	so you never know.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those,
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you never know what, what may occur,
A:	but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, uh,
B:	it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,
B:	it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh.
A:	I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,
A:	but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I wish, uh,
B:	like, uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they'd go up, you know, and do things
B:	and,
A:	So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about the "they" in this sentence should probably be a Russia and all that?
B:	Oh.
B:	No,
B:	it's still probably going,
B:	but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know,
A:	and then,
B:	But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles,
B:	they're still going to be subs and things.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and we don't know who's handling them now
B:	Yeah.
A:	so that's a whole different story now.
B:	Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was going to have them.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	At least that was, you know, that's what everybody says.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	we want only Russia to have them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And now they're saying, Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	you're a republic,
B:	you don't want those,
B:	you don't want those.
A:	Some crazy hit man over there so, with those little republics or whatever
A:	they splitting it all up now,
A:	and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you never know.
A:	But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he.
A:	Pretty much.
B:	One hopes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that way, you can't never tell that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Kiss some butt,
A:	but, but, uh,
A:	Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, funding for AIDS research?
A:	Do you,
B:	Well, uh, uh, that's something I've thought a lot about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I, I work in a hospital.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years
B:	and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, my, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with
A:	Yeah.
B:	or I think they already would have by now, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.
B:	I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, what about you?
A:	Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now You know.
B:	I'm not either.
B:	I'm definitely not aware of how much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, that's something I've never really kept up with at all.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, I don't,  I'm not sure, uh,
A:	I mean, I,
A:	go ahead.
B:	I know, uh, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research,
B:	you know what I mean?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, that sort of thing.
B:	Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I, I can see that research is needed
A:	and, you know,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Definitely.
B:	I think so,
B:	I think so.
A:	I mean it's becoming a major problem.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh. I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on, uh, preventing it, uh in more, You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	That's true because, uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease.
A:	Right,
A:	and I, I feel like just saying, uh, safe sex is not the answer.
B:	Uh,
A:	It's it's, uh abstinence in certain cases
B:	No.
B:	It's definitely not.
A:	and
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh,
A:	And, knowing, you know,
B:	Myself, uh, uh, I'm just recently, or about to, get a divorce
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, because you never know what's going to happen
B:	You don't know who you're going to come across, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Course, it's, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's something you got to think about these days.
A:	Yeah.
B:	A single person. You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	I think for a lot of people it has.
B:	Certainly.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	But, uh, uh, I know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Drug addicts.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I don't know,
B:	I don't think that's a bad idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know it, uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction
A:	Yeah.
B:	It just sort of keeps that going.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I don't know,
B:	at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS, so far, cannot be. You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, I don't know,
B:	that, I think that's,
B:	I'm not too much against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know,
B:	what do you think about that? It really is.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	boy that's a hard issue
A:	It really is.
B:	It really is.
B:	They gave us a hard topic
A:	Yeah
A:	I mean, I, I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed,
A:	but as you say, uh, people, I mean, in the meantime,
A:	well someone who's not ready to give up drugs, uh, You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's true.
A:	If they're perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then  you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as something to, to do about it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, so I don't know.
B:	Uh, course, there's so many things in the world where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, but I've never looked into how much money they're spending.
B:	I have, I have no idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I really have never looked into it.
B:	I have no idea.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I haven't either.
A:	I've heard, you know, uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, Mostly that's what I've heard,
B:	Right,
B:	sure.
A:	so I don't know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, yet, I know it's, uh, it sounds like big money to me
B:	Yeah
A:	But it  probably takes  a lot.
B:	I think it is.
B:	I think it is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does every,
A:	So,
B:	It seems to take more than, uh, for any little thing they do,
B:	it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would. You know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that,
B:	That's one thing I've never really feared.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, uh, I,
B:	a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions,
B:	but, uh uh, I don't fear it at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I work in, in the operating room a lot
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, and, of course, when
A:	Hello?
B:	Hello.
A:	How you doing?
B:	Fine.
A:	I'm Lee with, uh, uh,
A:	I'm over here in Plano, Texas.
B:	Okay.
B:	Let me ask you something, can I run a minute and shut my radio off?
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Okay.
A:	Oh.
B:	Okay.
A:	Where are you calling from
A:	or where are you at?
B:	Arlington.
B:	Arlington, Texas.
A:	Arlington.
B:	Yes.
A:	Well, there's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days.
B:	Yes,
B:	not all good stuff.
A:	Are you involved in any of that?
B:	No.
A:	No.
B:	No,
B:	I'm not, not personally.
A:	Well, uh, what benefits do,
A:	now, do you work?
B:	I'm going to school right now.
A:	Oh, you are?
B:	I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've got a lot of,
A:	Because I, I work for myself
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so, uh, there's a lot that I, that I guess I do miss, uh, a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation.
A:	I miss, uh insurance and uh, the steady paychecks that come.
B:	Yes.
B:	Right.
B:	Yes.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yes,
B:	I've been in my own business, Mary Kay, in fact,
B:	I'm selling in out now to go to school full time
B:	and I enjoyed the freedom of having that, you know,
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	go to work when I wanted to or not
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, the benefits weren't there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	I, uh, I own part of a roofing company.
B:	Oh, do you?
A:	In the, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, you know, unfortunately we, we were part of a, of a bigger, bigger company
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, uh, you know, we, we had all the benefits there
A:	and, and I do miss that. You know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, on the other hand, I, I, uh, I enjoy having the, the time that I have with my family and being able to, you know, work when I want
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	I think today the thing that I, uh, would appreciate the most,
B:	uh, because my husband gets, his medical through his company,
B:	but we have to pay for mine
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're the only one, I'm the only one that's being insured
B:	and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has, I mean,
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	so it's kind of,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I would,
B:	I really,
B:	and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to you need to have.
A:	It's,
A:	Yeah.
A:	It, it,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'll tell you what,
A:	that is the single most uh, benefit that I, that I enjoyed, and I do miss
B:	Right.
A:	because I looked into picking up some, uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, you know, just,
A:	and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it.
B:	It's out of sight.
B:	Right,
B:	it's out of sight.
A:	And, uh, yeah,
B:	Even at a group rate, I couldn't believe how much is our,
A:	Oh, yeah
A:	even at a group rate.
A:	Uh, it's, it's unbelievable
A:	and, uh, the amount that you have to pay for, you know, for kids
A:	and, and if you want to add dental to it, I mean, that's  that eats even more.
B:	Right,
B:	it goes up.
B:	Right.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	I guess what, the other benefits that, uh, that I, uh, that I miss, I guess is, uh, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and course, these days, you can't count on that because
B:	Right.
A:	uh, you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, uh, G M deal there in in Arlington
B:	Right.
A:	and I'm sure it will be, you know, quite a few people are affected by that
A:	so,
B:	Right,
B:	it's going to hurt the city,
B:	although, uh, I will personally tell you, I used to work at a bank,
B:	and I would see the G M people come in when they were, they would shut down to retool.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They were paid that whole time
B:	and I don't know, if you're aware of this
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yes,
B:	they come in there,
B:	just, they go off fishing and stuff and come in and, every Friday, and go to the safety deposit box,
B:	and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week, you know
B:	and, And they had all these
A:	Is that right?
B:	I, I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked.
A:	The union,
A:	yeah.
B:	And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck.
B:	I just read this in the paper the other day.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Plus probably an additional six months through the, the worker's stuff that they have at, at, uh, through the company
B:	so I'm you know, I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't feel as sorry for them,
A:	Well
B:	If my husband  were laid off tomorrow, we'd get one more check
A:	really the,
B:	and that would be it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really the ones it's going to hurt is, is actually the, the businesses around in that area.
B:	Yes.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that's already hurting.
A:	You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that, uh,
B:	But I think there's a case, where benefits have gotten,
B:	they voted them in
B:	and they got so good, I mean, like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical, all these things, you know
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it made the prices of cars go up
B:	and and, you know, the,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, we, I believe in unions,
B:	but they went too far.
A:	Well, I'll tell you, I I've had my fill of unions
B:	I mean, I can't make eighteen dollars an hour.
A:	I,
B:	I mean, I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, do you want to go ahead
A:	or,
B:	Oh, sure.
B:	Uh, well I, uh, went to school at Madison for two years
B:	and they are really big on women's rights. And, and equal treatment.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I, I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that.
B:	But, uh, I'm not that liberated.
B:	I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.
B:	But, uh, I think it's, I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more, more of them doing men's fields.
B:	I like to see that.
B:	And  I don't like to see women, you know, like waiting on men hand and foot
A:	Right.
B:	but, you know, I, I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other.
A:	I do too.
A:	I like the idea.
A:	I see a lot more, uh,
A:	my children, I have five children
A:	and they're all married.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I love seeing the men help the women so much.
B:	Right.
A:	And they both cooperate together on,
A:	I think it's great.
B:	Oh, me too
B:	I hope that happens to me someday.
B:	I mean, I, I don't mind  doing stuff.
B:	Uh, I have a boyfriend
B:	and I got to make him dinner and stuff
B:	but, you know, I, he'll help me do the dishes.
B:	I don't want to, you know expect to help to clean up then after
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So
A:	I've always taught my men that.
A:	They better clean up with their women and help them.
A:	If they did that, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	And they're, they're good about it.
A:	But it is neat to see them all work together.
A:	And  a big thing that I see. All that, most of the, most of the women getting married now, uh, go back, have gone back to, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they, they stay at work or go back to work. Or whatever.
B:	Right.
A:	And they're well educated.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I believe we'll see a lot more C E O in companies.
A:	They're having a fit about how little there are.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I think we'll see a lot more. Don't you? Of upper management? Then we do now, even.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I think it'll escalate.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, and I think black women now
A:	in fact I work at a high school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted
A:	and she's very sharp.
A:	And I think that
A:	and the ethnic thing will be, you know, is a good thing now.
B:	Oh, me too.
A:	They're moving them up
A:	and they're sharp
A:	and they,
A:	so you're going to see a lot, a lot more of that in leadership I believe.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I like to see that.
B:	I think it's, uh, really neat to see and all that educated minority, uh, person  who really knows what they're talking about.
A:	Uh-huh.  Right.
B:	And it's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. You know.
A:	Right.
A:	That's
B:	Especially black women.
A:	Yes.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But they know what they're doing.
B:	Right.
A:	But I'm not big on subserving as far as  to the men at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But I never have gone along with that, you know. Even far back.
A:	But I was brought up pretty good in a home that,
A:	years ago my mother was that way.
A:	The same.
A:	I,
A:	my
A:	you know,
A:	some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs. The inside jobs.
A:	But we never were taught,
A:	they had to do as much as we did.
A:	So that was good.
B:	Right,
B:	same here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So that's, I think that's good. To keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not, uh, necessarily by sex type thing.  You know.
B:	Right.
B:	Same here.
A:	You should be able to accomplish as much.
A:	And I think the, uh, attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, you know  you can do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If he  can do it, you can do it type thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly.
B:	I, I see more men, uh, like participating in like the family things with children. Like, you know, helping to take care of them more. And and, uh, uh, doing the jobs equally, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	What about politics on it?
B:	Oh.
A:	Do you think the political scene?
B:	I'm not that big on politics.
B:	I'm not that educated on it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm,
A:	I'm real I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene
A:	and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for, and even for President and Vice President this year,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I agree with that.
A:	there's nobody again.
A:	I think they're all scared out after after, uh,
A:	oh, what was the lady's name that ran a couple of,
A:	I forget her name now.
B:	Oh, I don't know
A:	But you know who I mean?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know who you're talking about.
A:	Yeah.
A:	She took such a rough go of it.
A:	And they their tax deal and,
B:	Yeah.
B:	At least she was strong to like try it and you know.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So that's good.
A:	But I wish they would get some more on that.
A:	I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.
A:	Uh, they, I didn't see any of the women in there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that disappoints me.
B:	Oh.
A:	And right now I don't think we have too many. Uh, in the forefront.
A:	Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Congress woman.
A:	And, uh, other uh,
A:	we really,
A:	Okay.
A:	I think the first thing they said,
A:	I have written this down
A:	so it would,
A:	is it do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?
B:	Okay.
B:	You're asking what my opinion about,  whether it's possible to have honesty in government.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I suspect that it is possible.
B:	Uh, I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody.
A:	Right.
A:	That's a good point.
B:	But, uh, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty.
A:	That's an you know, that's interesting.
A:	I had read something one time
A:	and it was just applying to governments in general,
A:	it was written many years ago.
A:	It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers.
A:	And I thought that was interesting.
A:	It wasn't just talking about our government.
A:	It was just government in general. From times past, you know on
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers.
A:	Right.
A:	And that would be a next question to ask.
A:	or are they in there for their own gains,
A:	and personally I feel it's probably, there's probably some of each.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But I think maybe a lot of them, um,
B:	say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while,  I'm in office.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth.
B:	So I guess it would be like anything else.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The president of General Motors probably has the same,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And they talked, uh,
A:	the other, let's see.
A:	Third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on,
A:	then they,
A:	that's hard to
A:	I'm sure there's a lot. But I agree with you, there's a lot in business.
A:	I think that's just, I think that's very normal,  that we should not I think,
B:	I think  I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be,  more to the point.
A:	I think we put too much on politicians.
A:	We expect them to only be there to serve us, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you knew what you were getting when you voted, uh,
A:	That's a problem, isn't it?
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's interesting
A:	because I'm taking a Texas government class right now,
A:	and one of the things
A:	it's so easy to blame them to
A:	a lot of times I think it's our own fault.
A:	They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they say you,  get the government you deserve.
A:	And it,
A:	If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and, Especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people's past,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.
B:	It's hard to imagine.
A:	Because it's, I think it's gotten just well,
A:	we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life
A:	and, and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, on, say in the Bobsy twins or,  something like that
A:	Right.
A:	You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out.
A:	I don't think there would be too many left
B:	So you're taking a government course?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	At what?
B:	The university?
A:	Uh, at, uh, it's T C J C.
A:	Tarrant County Junior College.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	And it's really, it's really enjoyable.
A:	I like it.
A:	And then they also, you know, ask can we eliminate, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,
A:	and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.
B:	You can make laws against corruption
A:	Yeah,
A:	but that,  doesn't mean,
B:	But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?   Milwaukee, did it?
A:	I don't think making laws will stop it.
A:	I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have.
A:	I mean,
A:	No,
A:	sure didn't,  did it?
A:	So no,
A:	I think you can legislate
A:	but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating,
A:	and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know,
A:	I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, I mean, you know.
B:	Actually, I think other countries may have it worse, uh,
B:	the Japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal.
A:	Right.
B:	Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes
A:	but when I think about where I'd want to go, you know, this is still the best
A:	or I can,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've been around to a few other countries
B:	and I, uh, I, I have not found one yet that I would rather live in.
B:	I think, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	at its worst I think we've got the best.
A:	Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets there at your home?
B:	Yeah, I do.
A:	And what kind do you have?
B:	I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.
B:	I live alone in an apartment, and, uh,  except for the cat.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, we have a cat, um,
A:	he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?
B:	Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,
B:	so  he's an indoor cat,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.
B:	How about yours?
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.
B:	Huh.
A:	He's, uh, been so mean to her
B:	And, and you say you've had him how long?
A:	We've had him for about two years
B:	Two years.
A:	and he was so mean to her, um, right after we first got him.
A:	So we had him neutered, and, and declawed,
A:	and now he bites her.
A:	He can't scratch her any more,
B:	Huh.
A:	he bites her.
B:	Does he bite her enough to draw blood?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	he has a couple of times,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But he's a very possessive cat.
A:	He, he loves my son,
A:	it's his cat,
A:	and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
B:	Yeah.
A:	and he's so funny,
A:	he just follows my son around just like a dog.
B:	Huh.
A:	He won't even let my son shower.
B:	Yeah.
A:	He meows and wants to get in the bathroom
A:	and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.
A:	So he's quite a animal
B:	Yeah,
B:	boy,
B:	I guess.
B:	Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
A:	but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,
A:	and we do keep our daughter away from him.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house
B:	Is that the only pet that you have?
A:	It is,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.
A:	Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home.
A:	So, we gave him up and tried.
B:	Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	we're in a house,
A:	but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,
B:	I see.
A:	we couldn't allow him to run free,
A:	so, he was just chained up all the time,
A:	and it was, it was  unfortunate.
B:	Sure.
A:	So have you tried any other pets?
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	I, I live alone in an apartment,
B:	and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh
A:	Oh
B:	although I've heard rabbits are pretty good
A:	Oh.
B:	you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	and they apparently, uh,
B:	especially when they're young when they bring them in
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	uh,
A:	And do they, they just paper train it or something?
B:	I guess.
B:	I guess,
B:	yeah,
B:	and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, rabbits are darling.
A:	That would be fun if you could get them trained.
A:	Otherwise they're pretty smelly
B:	Yep,
B:	that's right.
A:	Oh.
B:	Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, uh,
A:	Huh-uh,
A:	we don't have C, we don't have cable.
B:	I see.
B:	Well they have, uh, uh, a they call it the Westminster Dog Show, uh,
B:	I think it's in New York City at the, at the Gardens
B:	there once a year live
A:	Oh.
B:	and they had that on last week,
B:	and that's really kind of something  to watch, uh,
A:	Oh.
B:	it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
A:	Is that right?
B:	and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there.
A:	Oh
B:	Some of them are really beautiful, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Well, I'd be, interesting to watch.
B:	So you live in Utah do you?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Elton.
B:	Goodness.
A:	We live out here by, it's by Ogden.
A:	It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we really love it out here.
A:	It's, uh, kind of country.
A:	We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, we're kind of country but not too.
B:	Well do you all work for T I, or for,
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	Do you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Oh, well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas.
B:	This is the very first one I've, I've talked to.
A:	Oh, well, great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've been doing it for about two weeks
A:	and, uh, no my, No my,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So how do you get most of your current event information?
B:	Well, , see I'm going to school right now,
B:	and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,
B:	and I do, like to do other stuff with it.
A:	Right.
B:	While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's kind of helpful.
A:	I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,
A:	you keep up on what's going on.
B:	That's true,
B:	I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,
B:	so.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I'm a housewife,
A:	I have three kids,
A:	and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on. .
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you watch, do you watch the network, like major network news,
B:	or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?
A:	Just the regular channel  just channel eight.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	That's our channel here
A:	that's the, um, eyewitness news.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Oh, see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,
B:	so it's kind of different.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think, I think the, uh,
B:	I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,
B:	but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.
A:	Right.
A:	And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,
A:	and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
A:	I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	because they can, they can only report on, I mean,
B:	they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,
A:	I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections
A:	and, I guess I do read that,
A:	and I do study who's running in our area,
A:	and I do study what's going on in the economy.
A:	It, you know,
A:	and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.
B:	What kind of, see,
B:	I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,
B:	and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about
A:	Right.
B:	but other than that I don't really read,
B:	I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.
A:	I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles
A:	or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,
A:	but I just can't seem to find the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh.
A:	Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,
A:	and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.
A:	You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
B:	Yeah.
A:	that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information.
B:	If they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh.
A:	Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that's,
B:	they start, already they're having like, um,
B:	in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,
B:	and they've got like a countdown,
B:	it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
A:	I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
B:	But, uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I can't believe, I mean,
B:	they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,
B:	I guess people want to hear about it.
B:	Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	and they did so well last year.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,
A:	and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But.
B:	It seems like,
B:	I don't know,
B:	they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,
B:	if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it
B:	but I don't have cable.
A:	Dave.
A:	What kind of pets do you have?
B:	Oh, we have one rotten cat.
A:	One rotten cat
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's my son's cat.
A:	I heard a laugh in the background.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's the boys.
B:	They know I don't like it.
A:	Don't you like cats?
B:	Well, I like cats.
B:	This, this cat is a, uh, more like a dog.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	he's, uh, a one owner.
B:	He likes one boy in the family and that's about it
A:	That's odd.
A:	How does he treat the other people?
B:	Just, uh, stays away or runs usually.
A:	Wow.
B:	But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around.
B:	You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,
B:	but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing.
A:	Did he raise him or something?
B:	He's, he, we bought the cat for him
B:	and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him.
B:	But I, I've never owned a cat like that.
B:	I've had cats growing up all the time
B:	and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh, that's interesting.
B:	So, it's a weird cat
A:	Huh. We have a, a mutt.
B:	A mutt.
A:	Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, some lady, she, uh,
A:	a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house
B:	Oh.
A:	and she use to work for a veterinarian
A:	so she would uh, neuter them give them all their shots
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we saw an ad saying it was free,
A:	so we went down there and picked it up
A:	and it's been an excellent dog,
A:	but it's my first dog I've had
A:	and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone  while I go to work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.
B:	So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?
A:	Uh yeah.
A:	Right now it, it is.
B:	You feel like.
A:	It's kind of good training.
A:	I mean we have been trying for kids,
A:	but right now we haven't had any,
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes
B:	Have, have you had dogs before?
A:	Uh, my brother has.
A:	Uh, we didn't do a lot with them.
A:	Uh, I never felt like it was mine or anything,
A:	you couldn't do anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I mean, that did, did more responsibility. When its yours and not your brother's
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	Well, I just, uh, we've, you know
B:	when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog
B:	and we had mostly mutts,
B:	well not mutts, but mixes you know like one or two mix
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs.
A:	That's what we found.
A:	Ours is, uh, like a cockapoo.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it's a really good dog.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	they seem to be, I mean, listen better or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is your cat a purebred?
B:	No.
B:	No,
B:	it's just uh an accident
B:	From a uh, from my, my son's friend down the street.
B:	They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so,
A:	Would you ever want a dog in the family?
B:	Uh, we, I would.
B:	We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I should say a pup
B:	and he was just too big for our kids when we got him
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet
B:	and it was a dog that we gotten
B:	and he was, he was just too big.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the kids couldn't handle him
B:	and I was still going to school
B:	and my wife was working
B:	and I was working
B:	and so we just didn't have time to really train him
B:	so he was kind of you know, he was too big for the kids to handle,
B:	so he was just tied up to a post
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	so we gave him to, uh,
B:	I don't know if you've,
B:	there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they have, uh,
B:	I guess it's kind of an animal shelter
B:	but he just takes a few the animals in
B:	and some he destroys
B:	and some he keeps.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we took him up there
B:	and he ended up keeping him.
B:	Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years.
B:	We, we've, saw him just about a year ago
B:	and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we asked him about it one day
B:	and he said yeah,
B:	he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life
A:	Wow.
B:	just goes everywhere with him.
B:	I, he would have been a great, great dog.
A:	He just needed a lot of time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hey Steve.
B:	Uh, They just, uh, they just started a recycling program here, I think.
B:	Actually, this is my first experience with recycling program
B:	but, uh, instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about, uh, I am starting to split split stuff up.
B:	The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb.
B:	They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there.
B:	What are they doing up there?
A:	Well, here in Saskatoon, uh, much the same thing.
A:	There is no curb pick up of, uh, any of the recycled products.
A:	Uh, we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people.
A:	Uh, there are areas where we could, uh,
A:	actually we have a couple of the, uh, handicapped societies, types of places where the uh, one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers
A:	so, uh, we are able to, uh, have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing
A:	and then there are, there's a uh, deposit program on plastic and glass containers. Well, primarily soft drink bottles
A:	and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh, rehabilitation centers
A:	and then they recycle the containers.
A:	They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container
A:	and then,
B:	The, the deposits only on like drink stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	Okay.
A:	On the, on primarily on soft drink, pops and that kind of thing
B:	Okay.
A:	and, uh, so, they induce recycling of plastic and glass, soft drink containers.
A:	Uh, we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and actually the recycler, there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler, uh, with the handicapped group will also accept those.
A:	So, uh, it's fairly, fairly extensive,
A:	but then again it's uh, it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city.
B:	So, did they,
B:	you're giving, are you giving these products to the handicapped group
B:	and the handicapped group is getting the uh, the money
B:	or or are you, or are they some home distributing the funds back to you.
A:	Well, actually there's, there's the opportunity for both.
B:	Oh. Okay.
A:	Generally the, uh, the handicapped group takes care of the things that
A:	actually, the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
A:	and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
A:	and then I, and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well
B:	That's very cool.
B:	You know there's a, I heard about a similar program in New York City where, uh, a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that,
B:	but what they do is employ, uh, homeless, I think mostly men, but homeless people to uh, go out and collect all the recyclable cans
B:	and and I think it's mostly cans.
B:	There may be bottles as well, but like beer cans, soda cans and what not
B:	and they, uh, bring them up to a one one centralized location and, uh, are able to collect the money from the various beer and, and soda manufacturers and, uh, and get more money to these people that desperately need it.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Uh, I guess partly because of our climate.
A:	Here in Saskatoon at least, the majority of central, uh,
A:	well, I want to say Central Canada,
A:	but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people.
A:	We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.
A:	Uh, there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, uh, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, uh, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes.
B:	Do they do it with news papers as well?
A:	They have done it some, uh,
A:	but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers.
A:	They are actually at, virtually all of the shopping centers. Like the shopping malls.
A:	There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects
A:	or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins
A:	and then the bins are collected.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, some of the,
A:	Jimmy , so how do you get most of your news?
B:	Well, I kind of, uh, I watch the, uh, national news every day, for one.
B:	I also read one or two papers a day
B:	and I'm a, I'm pretty much a news junkie
B:	and I tune in to C N N a lot.
A:	Oh, wow.
A:	So, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news is when?
B:	Uh, every evening at six thirty, I believe,
B:	I watch the national news.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Well, I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot,
A:	but I don't, uh, I don't, uh, subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also, uh, because,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, I, uh, I give to the United Way
A:	and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	as opposed to paying for cable.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I take away a, uh, addiction
A:	Oh, something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well I,
B:	Uh, overall I, I,
B:	the quality of the news you get off of most, uh, sources I would say is pretty low.
B:	It's,
B:	usually you get pretty incomplete coverage
B:	and that's one of the reasons where I, why I try and get as many sources as possible,
B:	because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of, of what is going on. You would hope,
B:	but still, you know, hard to say that what you've heard is what really is.
A:	Oh.
A:	What, what, uh, newspapers do you read?
B:	Well, I read, uh, the local newspaper
B:	and I also try and read one of the, uh, major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	For a while there I, I, I, uh, subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, actually a couple of newspapers because, uh, you know, my fiance,
A:	well, she was unemployed for a while
A:	so she, you know, really needed to look at the, the help wanted ads
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so often they, they the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of uh, news.
B:	Right.
A:	And, I don't know,
A:	NEW YORK TIMES is okay,
A:	but, uh, and when you read a lot of this stuff, the, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,
A:	but uh, I mean, they, they say it's like the sixth grade reading level,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I swear it's at least second or third grade, sometimes.
B:	Right.
B:	Pretty low.
A:	But, I don't know,
A:	uh, I think if you listen to like N P R or something like,
B:	Right,
B:	I, I really like N P R a lot.
A:	That's pretty good.
A:	Uh, and I like listening to that on, on, uh,
A:	when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to, to listen to it, because I,
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	I miss N P R a lot also.
B:	I really like them because they give, uh,
B:	instead of being, as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which I think is good.
A:	Uh,
B:	And they also,
B:	their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing.
A:	Well, McNeil and Lehrer,
A:	I guess he's leaving,
A:	one of them is leaving.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, they're, they're pretty good, too.
A:	Uh, I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right?
B:	Right
B:	yeah.
A:	Had that invasion or whatever it is.
B:	Sure was.
A:	Uh, but I, I don't know,
A:	I guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype.
A:	Look at the, the Smith trial.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, that was a joke.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was,
B:	but then you also have things where you, uh, where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	the N P R doing that,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know,
A:	I had, uh, some visitor
A:	and he was just just, I don't know, fixated on that, you know, just listened to it constantly.
B:	Uh-uh.
A:	Uh, and I guess that's good when it's live, if you, if you'll really want that,
A:	but that's not really providing you news.
B:	Right.
A:	It's, it's more like a media event rather than reporting.
B:	Well, but the but the news, news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I, I tune into every once in a while.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	That's kind of boring to me, I think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it is, really kind of boring,
B:	but, you know, that's,
B:	if, if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned, uh, report, somebody else's view about it
B:	and that's what you're supposed, you're supposed to,
B:	if you watch the news, you're going, your opinion is going to be formed about, on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own pinion, opinion, which I haven't, would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess that's true.
A:	But, one of the ways that I get information is, uh, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this, this thing,
A:	it's free inside the company,
A:	it's called INTELLECT
A:	and, and they basically, uh, type out abstracts which are really literally,
A:	I've, I've actually read the actual articles,
A:	they're pretty
A:	Let's see,
A:	mine's pretty easy actually.
A:	Uh, I just got done reading a, a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the, uh, new Saturns.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just like love to have one.
B:	Oh, really,
B:	you like, uh,
B:	so you're an American
A:	Well,
B:	you want to buy American.
A:	No,
A:	regardless of that fact.
A:	It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money.
A:	I'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
B:	Um.
A:	and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away.
B:	It terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
A:	Handling, power, everything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it just got like the top rating.
A:	It was compared up against, uh,
A:	let's see,
A:	there was like the Mazda M X three, uh, Nissan's, whatever, their two, N X two thousand, the Civic S I
A:	and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them.
A:	Everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it.
A:	I like the, I like the styling
A:	and, I seen a few of them actually race
A:	and they seem to be really good cars for it.
B:	What about Mustang G T
A:	Mustang G T
A:	Uh, can't afford it.
B:	Those,
B:	so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm a graduate student
A:	and, let's face it,
A:	I don't make any money
A:	so,
B:	Right.
B:	Well, you can wait till you graduate
B:	and you'll have plenty of money,
B:	you can buy whatever you want.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we'll see then.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right now I'm stuck,
A:	I, I've got a, a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that,
A:	it's fast, but unreliable
A:	and trying to get it prepared for racing.
A:	But it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the Saturn.
B:	Right,
B:	would you use that for city driving and racing?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I'd do it, I'd use it for both.
A:	The nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
B:	Autocrossing is,
B:	what kind of track is that?
A:	Uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times
A:	and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. And pylons and things.
B:	Okay.
B:	And you put up, set up the track, pylons.
B:	Okay.
A:	Tight turns, hard acceleration.
A:	I've seen a lot of Mustangs, uh, compete
A:	and it's interesting.
A:	They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I would guess so.
A:	Uh, what are you thinking about buying?
B:	Uh, I think I'd like to get, uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, I mean, a, a Acura Legend. Uh
A:	The Legend.
A:	Uh.
B:	a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I was, I was actually in, uh,
A:	a lot of the B M W are produced in, uh, uh, Stutgardt and, uh, and Munich
B:	Yes.
A:	and I was, I was there this, uh, summer
A:	and, uh, I was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for B M W.
B:	The,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, their, they have the whole philosophy,
B:	I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
A:	Uh,
A:	Oh, of course,
A:	of course they are.
A:	They want you to buy their car.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there,
A:	it was, it was interesting.
A:	I was at, I, I also went to, uh, the Porsche
A:	and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	the, uh, the B M W is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things
A:	and everything is put together with exacting tolerances
A:	and, and then you go to Porsche
A:	and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
B:	Um.
A:	and no two of them are alike
A:	And
B:	Yeah
B:	that's,
A:	so it's like completely opposed.
A:	I don't know,
A:	which do I like better,
A:	I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
B:	No,
B:	it's not realistic.
A:	Unless, it's, it's a toy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, uh
A:	Let's face it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	but it, it, B M W good for that.
A:	What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?
B:	Yeah,
B:	just work,
B:	short trips.
B:	No no heavy mileage.
B:	I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
A:	Wow, yeah.
B:	So it's pretty minimal.
A:	That's cool.
B:	Lasts a long time.
B:	That's mainly what I'm looking for.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
A:	I also, I was impressed by, uh, by the Mercedes, too.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I really, I really like the Mercedes.
B:	But, But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
A:	The factory was nice
A:	and,
A:	And is it different for the, for the B M W?
B:	Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different.
B:	Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
A:	Probably.
A:	Right,
A:	I can imagine that.
B:	So I'm kind,
B:	yeah,
B:	I'm not sure if I really want,
A:	All right?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	How many kids do you have?
B:	I think I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children.
B:	We,  have three children who are eleven, nine, and eight.
A:	Right.
B:	So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
B:	but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Anyway.
B:	You don't have children?
A:	No.
B:	But you're married?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we've been married for two and a half years.
A:	We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
B:	Oh.
A:	Hopefully,
B:	You know, I know we're not supposed to do this long distance
B:	but actually I'm getting a call.
B:	I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting.
B:	Could I ask you to hold one minute?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'll be right back.
B:	Excuse me,  just a moment.
B:	They're going to get mad
A:	whispers to someone in the She had another call.
A:	She has just three kids, eleven, nine, and eight.
B:	Hello?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm so sorry.
A:	All right.
B:	That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting.
A:	Okay.
A:	That keeps you
A:	do you have a lot of activities with your kids?
B:	Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation
B:	but, yes,
B:	we do.
B:	Both my husband and I work
B:	and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade.
B:	And the school years are wonderful,
B:	they're just wonderful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The kids, they are real people
B:	and they are interesting
B:	and, they, they have all their own activities
B:	and, um, I think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation
B:	our children have not yet decided to rebel
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So they're pretty good kids, huh?
B:	I'm sure that's coming though.
B:	But,  they are wonderful kids.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we had growing up
A:	I guess I can talk about us.
A:	We had nine kids in our family.
A:	We had eight boys and one girl.
A:	But, my Dad, uh,
B:	You had eight boys and one girl?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own business
A:	so we worked with him most of the time.
A:	So that's how we spent most of the time with him.
B:	Are you Mormons?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's what the Utah and the large family.
A:	That was a dead giveaway, huh?
B:	Well, we're Catholics.
B:	I came from a family of five.
B:	I had four brothers,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the only girl.
A:	Oh.
B:	And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
A:	Which that,
B:	I never felt spoiled.
B:	In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed
A:	I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.
B:	No.
B:	Usually busy fighting for survival.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's .
A:	But,
B:	Well, I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real issues here. Um,  that I think, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know.
B:	It's an interesting problem.
B:	I happen to, um,
B:	I'm a pediatrician.
A:	Oh.
B:	My husband is a physician,
B:	so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot.
B:	But children,
B:	I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing.
B:	And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really believe that.
B:	And it has, um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age,
B:	and I think our kids are real secure. And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I know it sounds like a rationalization
B:	but it's, I really think it's true for our family,
B:	and I think it has worked very well.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's like you said, you know, to each his own.
A:	And we're planning on having my wife stay home.
A:	And but,
B:	There's no question,
B:	I think that's really the best.
B:	If, if a woman is happy doing that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I hate to put it quite that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I was twenty-nine when I had my first child
B:	and, uh, I would not have been real fulfilled.
B:	I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother
B:	but, uh, I like I like the way I did it.
A:	Right.
B:	I sort of worked half time.
B:	I had very flexible hours.
B:	I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year
B:	and I,  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and I think we choose very, very carefully the, um, alternative situations that we had them in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Some baby-sitting groups,
B:	again, I know it sounds like a rationalization,
B:	but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children
B:	and they, they learn to share.
B:	They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that helps.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.
B:	Well, so, so . So, your wife, does she work right now?
A:	Um, no,
A:	not right now.
B:	She's out,
A:	Right.
A:	Well, we just moved down here.
A:	We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years.
B:	You're still trying to dry out?
A:	It's that's no problem here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we really liked it up there
A:	but then
A:	I don't believe that we're ,
B:	So what do you think about, uh, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie?
A:	The recycling program here is just terrible.
A:	I mean it's hard to find places to go.
A:	I mean, Kroger does a couple things.
A:	They, I don't think they, do they do newspapers?
B:	I don't know,
B:	there's, there's big bins out there,
B:	I don't know if they ever get
B:	I, I really don't know what the details are.
B:	There should be someplace where you could call and find out.
B:	As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, you know, thing to you,
B:	but, I think there should be some kind of curbside service.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's the only way I could really,
A:	The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything.
A:	They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They pick up everything.
B:	During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people
B:	I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we used to just save them up
B:	and then they'd come around
B:	and we'd give them to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, when,
B:	during the winter time I think they, they move south or something
A:	Yeah
B:	so, I don't do that anymore.
B:	And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know it,
A:	I know it.
B:	They just overflow.
A:	It piles up.
B:	So what's a guy to do?
A:	I just don't know.
B:	I asked myself.
A:	I just don't know
A:	and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center,
A:	you can't really unload all your stuff.
B:	Really?
B:	Huh, oh, yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	hadn't thought about that.
B:	That is very inconvenient.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Inconvenient, even
A:	I know it,
A:	I know it.
B:	But, uh,
B:	so, you do recycle, don't you?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.
A:	The ,
B:	If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.
A:	Well, I mean, it's real,
A:	you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And since we go there all the time, I mean
B:	But wait
A:	probably at all.
B:	I've never seen you before
B:	Who are you?
A:	Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my name's Bill.
B:	Well,
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi.
A:	I'm from Atlanta.
B:	Me, too.
A:	Neat.
B:	Crazy.
B:	Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?
A:	I just think that everybody ought to do it.
B:	Do they do
B:	like, what about, like, uh,
B:	what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
A:	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	What about like those grocery bags?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	they have, uh,
A:	uh, what I, what I used to, uh,
A:	now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot,
A:	but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, also most places, like Big Star does
A:	and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not
A:	but,
B:	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in.
B:	uh.
A:	Can bring them in.
B:	Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
A:	I know it,
A:	I know it.
B:	The hostile planet, I think, Julie.
A:	It really is a small,  hostile planet
B:	The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
A:	Did you know that,
A:	No,
A:	really not.
A:	Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
B:	Um.
B:	Paper just seems so innocuous.
A:	Huh?
B:	Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.
A:	Well, it is, it is, though.
B:	It comes from trees.
B:	How can it be bad?
A:	It is, because they,
B:	They treat it with chemicals or something?
B:	Why can't trees break down?
B:	I don't get it.
A:	Well, they do treat paper with chemicals
A:	like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.
B:	Yep.
B:	Oh
A:	You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper,
A:	it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah
B:	Huh.
A:	it will be whole.
A:	You'll be able to read  off of it.
B:	I'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then.
A:	Yeah, um.
B:	I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work
B:	and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on.
B:	I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.
A:	Well, white paper's bad too.
A:	They, they treat it, too.
B:	Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile.
A:	I'm sure that's fine.
A:	I'm sure.
A:	Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
B:	You think so?
A:	Maybe.
B:	Tablets?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.
A:	You think?
A:	I don't know,
A:	well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,
B:	What do you think?
A:	I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.
B:	Kind of radical, I know
B:	but,
A:	We would no longer need paper at all.
B:	That's true.
B:	Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.
A:	I would love that.
A:	So how do you, uh,
A:	so, so, it sounds like you've got a television going on there,
A:	so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news.
A:	Is that,
B:	I almost never watch T V news.
A:	Really?
A:	Wow.
A:	I ,
B:	I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio.
A:	Uh, what, what station do you listen to?
B:	Uh, it's a local radio station.
B:	It's called, uh, K L I F, cliff.
A:	Cliff, I see,
A:	so, uh, it's not affiliated with anything, is it.
A:	Not it's not a network station.
B:	No.
B:	No.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	because I, I listen to, uh, public radio a lot
A:	and they have, they have K C R W, which I, I, I saw a thing recently, they may be trying to start their own, uh, cable TV outlet, I guess.
A:	They're getting a little, getting a little feisty now
B:	Well, this has, this station has a lot of just ongoing news
A:	Uh,
B:	and occasionally in the morning, I'll pick up something like, uh, C N N or that,
B:	but I hate watching the, like, ten o'clock news
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you have a paper or something or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have a well, we have, uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We read, I read it pretty much from cover to cover.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How do you like it?
A:	It's been, it's been a while since I read the Dallas news.
A:	I, uh, fact, last time I read the Dallas, Dallas news I was in Arkansas.
A:	I, uh ,
B:	The TIMES HERALD went out of business here
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one, Fort Worth newspaper.
A:	Well, that must be pretty bad.
A:	So, how did that happen, anyway?
B:	Uh, financial trouble.
A:	No,
A:	not how,
A:	I mean, when did it, when did they ,
B:	Oh, when did it happen?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess they closed down about three months ago.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Um.
B:	So, how do you keep up?
A:	Oh, me, I, uh, good grief, I read the TIMES, LOS ANGELES TIMES.
A:	There's, quite a task if you've ever run into one.
A:	They're, uh
B:	Yes, they're very voluminous.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're thick.
A:	Uh, if there's something you want to know, it's, it's in the TIMES and then, and in detail. *repair bracketing wrong
A:	Uh, they, uh, we, we used to have two papers here in town
A:	and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of, oh, I don't know, just nobody was buying it really.
B:	So there really is only one major L A now?
A:	Yeah,
A:	pretty much.
A:	Uh, there used to be, fact, I think there still is, the, uh, the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley
A:	and, uh, they're not bad as far as a, uh, you know, as far as a local paper goes.
A:	In fact, it was kind of weird, because I met the, uh, I met the, I met the editor, uh, while I was on, uh, while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time
A:	It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff.
A:	He was a really cool guy. Uh, you know, went to Columbia University and all this stuff.
A:	And, uh it's, it's a pretty good paper,
A:	but, uh, you know, it's not, it's not the TIMES.
B:	and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.
B:	Uh, and then moving up, I run in the mornings,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week
A:	Right.
B:	and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,
B:	but it's along the lines,
A:	Right.
B:	How about yourself.
A:	Well, um, that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I walk with my parents, occasionally,
A:	nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule,
A:	and, um, I play racquetball,
A:	but I haven't since I've been out of school.
A:	I don't have anywhere to do that,
A:	but that's going to start soon again
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I play softball once a week, which is kind of more recreation than exercise.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because I really don't like to exercise,
A:	I think that's the basic point of it, is I'm not, I, I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise,
B:	Right.
A:	but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, I don't mind
B:	Right.
A:	so I have to disguise it,
A:	it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it.
B:	That's right.
A:	That's kind of the same thing for me.
A:	I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it.
B:	Right.
B:	So you look at it more as a task.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	if it's exercise, it's a task.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't want to do anything I have to do.
B:	I see.
A:	I mean, I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom,
A:	but I won't do it if I have to do it.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	So, I'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	I'm twenty-two.
B:	and so, it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise.
A:	Right.
B:	My job at Texas Instruments, I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, I don't get any exercise doing that
A:	Right.
B:	and plus there's a build up of stress
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner,
B:	and I need to go out in the morning and run
B:	or I'll just get nuts
A:	Right.
B:	so that's kind of a motivator,
B:	so even though I can look at it as a task, the, you know, I kind of get the, I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying, Well, I'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.
A:	Right.
A:	Eating right and no cholesterol and all that.
B:	Sure,
B:	that all,
B:	I, I do all that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we,
A:	I'm sure, I will do,
A:	I'm doing that more and more than I used to
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it, but it's still at the task stage.
B:	Right.
A:	Is it a pleasure for you,
A:	or are you,
B:	Well, it's a,
B:	something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable.
A:	Right.
B:	I do that at the end of the day,
B:	and it takes, you know,
B:	that, that during that time the stress from the day goes away.
B:	I get to share whatever I did with my wife, and, and vice versa.
A:	Right.
B:	Going to the gym is, is actually something different than, than, like,
B:	oh, and the running,
B:	and I enjoy that too.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Year,
B:	I've been running since high school on track teams and the like,
A:	Oh.
B:	so, running, I, I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
B:	and you don't think about the pain of it.
B:	You, you, you take the time to relax some how
B:	and you think about other things.
B:	During those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and that's no fun.
B:	And it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people.
A:	Right,
A:	that's,
A:	I never got past that stage.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the the, uh, weight lifting on the other hand is actually, you know,
B:	I think I look better.
A:	Right.
B:	I have just a, I don't, I'm not a huge person,
B:	I'm just a regular looking guy,
B:	but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife,
B:	and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is, is attractive
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	so that pays also.
A:	That's good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work the, with my wife, which is nice,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I love her, you know,
B:	I enjoy being with her
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess that's one thing,
B:	but also, uh, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.
A:	Right,
A:	that's it,
A:	I do the occasional push up and sit up.
A:	I haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because I feel, I felt real competitive there,
A:	and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are ...
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I don't, I don't let that bother me,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	that's something that comes with time, too. You know,
A:	Right.
B:	I'll tell you, the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's your own,
B:	you, you're, you're struggling against your own body weight
A:	Right.
B:	you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower, by putting your arms further apart or closer together, by doing them real quick or real slow
A:	Right.
B:	and you can actually get a good
B:	you can, I know in the push up, at least, you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's a good idea,
A:	but I do have my ride,
A:	we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house.
B:	Oh, is that right.
A:	I'll do those once in a while just you know, like at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on and I can't sleep,
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	I'll get up and stair step for half an hour
B:	That's funny.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's, I guess, pretty, pretty healthy,
A:	but I don't have a regular plan, that's
B:	Yeah.
A:	I need to get started on that.
B:	Well, you know, maybe not.
B:	I'd say, I'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting, getting the exercise otherwise.
A:	Right.
B:	When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between, uh, when you, when you add something to your life, when you add a plan to your life,
B:	something else has to go away
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's the hard decision, is, okay, if I'm going to run in the mornings, what am I, what do I trade it off for.
B:	Well, the answer's sleep, right.
A:	Sleep
B:	If I'm going to walk at night, what do I trade it off for.
B:	Well, Star Trek
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or, you know, it, it, it's always trade offs,
B:	and you actually have to, as you get older you have to really think what can go, and what, to, to, to replace this thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's, I mean, not just exercise, but anything.
B:	It's very hard.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, I don't, I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet.
A:	That'll come some day when I,
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess if you care, or if your wife, your future wife, uh, gives you a reason to care which helps
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I hope so.
B:	Well, I think we covered it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	sounds good.
B:	Nice talking with you, Craig.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you too.
A:	Have a nice day.
B:	You too.
B:	Good day.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	what do you think is the biggest problem?
B:	The biggest problem, well, like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that, uh, you know, you can throw money at it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's,
B:	I don't know,
B:	to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know, because, I mean, the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school, I mean,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it the, do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home.
B:	Uh, well, the values, more or less at home and the T V, just a general,
B:	I mean, learning is not a revered endeavor, really,
B:	I mean, it's a lot more,
B:	it's socially, well I won't say socially unacceptable,
B:	but whereas like in, uh, a person that, uh,
B:	they put a lot more emphasis on athletics
B:	and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society,
B:	and I think that carries over to school a lot.
A:	Right.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I, I think that the biggest problem is, uh, with the, uh, with the home environment being part of it.
A:	You know, if,
A:	I think too many parents expect, uh, the school to teach, uh, the moral aspects of, of things to the to the kids and, you know, while we're not going to worry about, uh, teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that, you know, and then expect them to pick it up at school,
A:	you're not going to do that, you know,
A:	you're going to carry, carry with, carry to school, uh, out into the world, you know, what you learned at home,
A:	and, uh uh, I think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with, with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for, for people than in, in other things, than we may have seen in the past, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and part of it's the, the family, I think,
A:	and part of it's, uh, the living conditions of certain people are subjected too,
A:	drugs is a big problem now,
A:	and I think that's, that's, that's another root problem.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	you know, I wonder if that's a root problem or not,
B:	because I think about that a lot,
B:	and it's just like, everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now,
B:	but I wonder, you know,
B:	do you get the,
B:	oh, that's kind of side tracked,
B:	but, uh, I just remember seeing on the news the other night, they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better, and not so much when I was growing up,
B:	Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools,
B:	but, uh, they still had a, a better success rate, simply because they started with a lot better raw material.
B:	I mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had, uh, at least the parents did, at least, had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it.
A:	Right,
A:	Right.
B:	And I wonder if, not so much that, uh,
A:	Well, I think it's, like you say, it's, it's the socioeconomic mix
A:	there, you know, the, they're,
A:	you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically, uh, that might be more well well off, you know, going to a private Catholic school or whatever, uh,
A:	and, and they're not all that way,
A:	but, you know, some that are um, that, they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city, uh, you know, public schools.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	this is interesting because in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,
B:	but, uh, this, this was actually inner city
A:	Yeah.
B:	people were sending,
B:	I mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,
B:	like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education. It shows, I think it shows that the parents have some, uh, desire for, for the kid to do, do well, you know,
A:	and that may be passed on down to the kid as well,
A:	and, uh, maybe they pick up on that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then from the other aspect, um, maybe the, uh, school itself has, has, has more emphasis on, uh, trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller, uh,
A:	they may be able to, to give the resources that's needed to, uh, to do a good job.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean,
B:	and what do you, what would you do to fix the school systems?
A:	Uh, that's a tough question how to fix the school system.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Uh, with, uh,
A:	I would try to, I guess, to see about getting parents more involved, with, try to, to come up with more ways to do that. Uh, uh, uh, stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students, and, uh, more, more classes that I think that are,
A:	and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of, um, morals, trying to teach the kinds of things that, that aren't getting taught at home, and, uh, and, and respect for other people.
A:	Uh, I think that's a big part of it.
A:	You know, people, you know,
A:	if you don't care about property and people, you know, you're not going to care about, uh, about learning, I think. You know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you're not going to really care about yourself.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's what I was going to say.
B:	It's the chicken and the egg thing.
B:	I wonder, a lot of times, you know, people, I mean, a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise,
A:	Right.
B:	and you get,
B:	I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school.
B:	They're even in grade school when they do that.
B:	But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that.
B:	But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school.
A:	Well, you know, and I,
A:	that's not an but that's not an easy task, you know,
A:	that's why I say, it's, it's a tough question what would you do,
A:	because, you know, even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when, uh, when, when you're growing up in, you know, in a home which may be, uh, just the pits,
A:	and uh, you don't have any, any kind of a good environment to live in, you know,
A:	it's kind of hard to say, well, you need to take care of other people's stuff as well, when you're, when you barely have anything yourself.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I could see where that would be a problem,
A:	and I think that's, I think it's ...
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, I, uh, I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers, I'm not a lawyer, uh, that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I'm not sure,
A:	and I, I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of, of the value of, and worth, so that they have real problems when it comes to, uh, uh,
A:	they can find guilt or innocence
B:	Right.
A:	uh, but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that.
B:	Right,
B:	I agree, too.
B:	I don't think the jury should be the ones that, that put the sentencings down.
B:	I think the judges should,
B:	or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. Might be better at than just regular civil people. Not knowing, you know, exactly what things are, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because I find that, uh,
A:	I've been on a few juries
A:	and, uh, as a say, I, I tend to be around, uh, civil cases because I've been an expert witness some,
A:	and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence
A:	and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, that, uh,
A:	when I only do something one, two or three times I'm hardly an expert on it,
A:	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.
B:	Yeah
B:	and,
A:	And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a, you know, worth five years or twenty-five.
B:	Right,
B:	that's,
B:	yeah.
B:	And, and most people that do sit on juries,
B:	some people just sit on them once in their lifetime, you know, if they're that lucky sometimes Or, you know, what, whatever the case may be. And, and may not have any idea of what, what the standard punishment would be for it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it, they may have some different idea,
B:	I mean, it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was, uh, longer, you know, that didn't fit, the punishment didn't fit the crime. Or not long enough or, you know, whatever the case may be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I think the judges do have that, that better knowledge of it.
B:	The only thing I worry about sometimes is if, if you get somebody in there that, that has a name, that is the defendant and, you know, sometimes, might have more pull, which that does happen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, we can't say it doesn't, because it does happen.
B:	I mean not everybody is, you know, has, has the right morals sometimes.
B:	People can be paid off or politically or whatever the case may be
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and sometimes that's not real fair either, though
B:	so,
A:	Well, one of the others things that gets me on, on the juries is that often in the newspaper, I, I tend to hear two things that, well, that go on.
A:	One is, you often see in the headlines the big numbers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences, or get changed by a judge or an Appeals Court
B:	Right.
A:	and that never makes the, the press
A:	and so, when, uh, you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines, uh,
A:	and we don't have, again, a lot of knowledge,
A:	so we don't know what is really going on, what is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, well, also what I don't think is fair, either, is when you have like a, say a rapist, come in,
B:	and, and his attorney gets his sentences, sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge, like, I don't know what, assault or something or,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, which that doesn't make any sense to me either.
B:	this is the second time the person has said 'which that' I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot
B:	and, and, and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't,
B:	I mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they, they're put on like, they were the ones that caused it or whatever,
B:	but, to me, when you do the crime, then you should pay for whatever you did,
B:	and, and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge.
B:	I don't, I don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say, Oh, well, you know, that was a breeze,
B:	I can go out and do it again and, you know have the same thing happen.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's, that's not right.
A:	Well, that's where, uh, the role of juries is, is restricted
A:	and, I'm not sure I'd want to change that aspect of it,
A:	one is, it's restricted in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that are actually, uh, brought, you know
B:	Right.
A:	if it's first degree rape, second degree rape or whatever, they only get to decide on that,
A:	well, okay this person has been charged with first degree rape, uh,
A:	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, such like, maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.
A:	The other thing that juries are restricted on and, and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my, even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get to hear all the information.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's what information is presented
A:	and, uh, I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,
A:	but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence.
B:	And to me, how can you, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it be, whether it pertains to the case or not,
B:	somebody thinks it, it had, because they've got it there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So the lawyers, the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the truth that's brought out is, uh, as I say, when I've heard about, you know,
B:	Don't they?
A:	the oath is to tell the truth,
A:	the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is that they want, uh,
A:	they don't want, uh, the whole truth.
A:	I mean you can say,
B:	They only put part of it.
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The,
A:	because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the, of the truth.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that's just like that old witness game,
B:	well, it's a game kids play, too,
B:	but, uh, somebody did it, just for your train of thought where they, they showed something
B:	and they asked,
B:	they, there were, uh, like four people,
B:	Hello.
A:	Hello.
A:	My name is Nola.
A:	I'm in Plano, Texas.
B:	Hi Nola,
B:	I'm Steve.
B:	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
A:	Not too far away.
B:	No,
B:	that's unusual.
B:	Seems like usually,
A:	I've had some from Plano, too.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	I think all mine have been East Coast people so far
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay
B:	So,
A:	um, let's see.
B:	social changes,
A:	Social changes.
B:	what's that mean?
A:	That sounds like not as recent social changes, too, like back to the sixties or fifties, I guess
B:	Yeah.
A:	Think we can handle that?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I definitely,
B:	I mean there's plenty of things to talk about there.
B:	That's a,
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	shall I go ahead and push one?
B:	Yeah,
B:	sure.
A:	Okay
A:	You want to go ahead and start?
B:	Uh, I was hoping that you would
B:	but, oh,
A:	Oh
B:	In social changes is that,
B:	uh, it seems to me that, uh,
A:	That involves  a lot of different areas, I think.
B:	Does that,   Yeah.
B:	Like a lot,
B:	it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, is even more, true today. You know?
A:	Yeah,
A:	there is a a big difference in the, uh, economic, um, status of, uh, people although I think that has been true, uh, always.
A:	Um, perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's like people are starting to give up hope
B:	and they start out very poor.
B:	Let's see,
B:	that's a bad tangent to get on.
B:	What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties  and the nineties?
A:	Uh,
B:	No.
A:	I think, uh, in my situation,
A:	I have three children
A:	and we're, uh, home schooling.
A:	So, education, you know, things that relate to education, um, are things that I think about a lot.
A:	Um, I think that, and I think that involves social changes a lot.
A:	Uh, for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of, uh, things that are happening socially in the world around them and in, in, because of their parents
A:	and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home, rather. More not than are. And children being put in day-care centers from very early,
A:	and, and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening, such as the day-care centers and things, are having a big effect on the social changes.
A:	Because of the way children are being raised, they're not learning the values they need to learn.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they're not, um, they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have
A:	and they don't have the, um, a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world.
A:	And, uh, I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang, gang things that are happening
A:	and, and, um
B:	Yeah.
B:	It seems, so that,
B:	yeah,
B:	that is a pretty big change.
B:	It seems, even not just single parent families but with no guidance
B:	but it seems like, some of these even ladies that, that'll work and have,  a baby and then, you know, after two or three months, go back to work.  You know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh it's,
B:	well that, that, I mean that's very, young for a baby.
A:	That's really sad.
A:	I think that a lot of people,
A:	and they think they have to
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think that if they really tried, they wouldn't have to.
A:	And,  I, I think that if they didn't that, and it became more of the standard not to that, uh, I don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home. You  know? And have a more solid, uh, foundation for the kids.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I mean they're going to,
B:	like you said, I mean, there's, they might be saving money,
B:	I mean even if they had to pay more now, I mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to  force two people to work. Even though  it's higher productivity is short-term.
A:	That's right.
A:	It's already,  It already costs society much more because of it.
A:	You know it,
A:	trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those. You wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, there's,
A:	and I think, uh, a lot of it is selfishness.
A:	People have become very selfish.
A:	They don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that.
B:	yeah
A:	There are a lot of two parent, um, situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do, you know.
B:	Oh rather than she needs the money  just she wants the   stimulating environment
A:	Rather than that,  she has to have the money particularly.
A:	Or, maybe there's a small need for money
A:	so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself, too  You know,
B:	Huh. It,
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's interesting how, uh,
B:	home study. Is that what you said?
A:	Home school.
B:	Home school.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Is that, uh, is, is it like, uh, a preschool level then or through  grade school or,
A:	No.
A:	I , I have, uh, one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler.  And one on the way
B:	Oh I
B:	Oh, well you sound busy
B:	So you're teaching them, completely
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I think, uh, it's becoming, uh, more popular then it has been for a while, I think.
A:	Home schooling's always been around
A:	but, uh, I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools.
A:	Um, and a lot of it is discipline problems.
B:	Yeah.
A:	A lot of it is,
A:	and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers.
A:	It, it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things.  That, um, they've been raised in a day-care center.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's pretty sad because, I mean, I don't know, something's got to change with the schools.
B:	That's what it all boils down to in the end, usually anyway.
A:	Well, I think it's going to,  change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.
B:	When they're young,
B:	Yeah
A:	The home is the base,
A:	it's the basic unit.
A:	And that's the, where it all starts
A:	and if we don't start making changes in the homes
A:	and maybe part of that is educating parents better.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And educating, uh, you know
B:	Changing people's expectations.
A:	I know they do do some, they do have some classes in, um, high schools and things for kids to, uh, give them an idea of what family life is like and the, uh, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing
A:	but, uh,
A:	The AIDS issue is, is a bit of a problem.
A:	I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem, is, is the financial end.
A:	And how can a country stand to, uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem, uh,
A:	but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, I'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer.
A:	Uh, there's some, uh,
A:	take breast cancer, for instance.
A:	It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more many more people than AIDS.
A:	And yet, uh, more people die of it,
A:	and yet the funding has already, uh, exceeded,
A:	AIDS has more money than, uh, breast cancer
B:	Than,
B:	well, that's interesting, isn't it,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, uh,
A:	I mean, if it's true.
A:	I, I've, I've always heard these things.
A:	I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure,
A:	but, uh, I've heard it on more than one documentary that, uh, they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and, uh,
A:	it's just one big P R campaign that,
A:	yeah,
A:	we think that's the world's worst thing
A:	so let's give money to AIDS.
A:	And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years.
B:	Right.
A:	And, it's just
A:	one of those, uh, course, one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going to get funded.
A:	And, uh, having thought about that for a while,
B:	What did you think about that idea?
A:	Well, I, I kind of, I thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.
A:	But then I got, I got to thinking, the, the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate
A:	and there's only one test that just recently got developed, uh, a blood antigen, uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood
A:	and that's fairly recent.
A:	And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.
B:	They've not really given it attention either,
B:	yeah.
A:	So it's not really cured,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's not, uh, not that heavily funded either
A:	and then that seems to be one of the, the major, uh, problems that men have in the realm of cancer,
A:	so, I don't know.
A:	I, I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. Uh, be it through different organizations, March of Dimes type, uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, uh, illness they wish.
B:	Right.
A:	It's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that.
A:	I mean, it's really hard to say,
A:	well, there's, you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one
A:	so let's give it this amount,
A:	and then this other one's only a tenth of that,
A:	so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep doling it out that way
A:	or,
B:	Well, I'm, I'm glad I'm not the one that's, that's in charge of, of making those decisions.
B:	They, uh, you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious, you know.
B:	I mean it's not so serious, I guess, until it affects your family
B:	and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing.
A:	Right.
B:	So I, I would hate to have that responsibility just personally
B:	but, but then, again, we really, we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address
B:	I, uh, I guess I, it, it frightens me to think of so many people with, with AIDS and with cancer
B:	and many of those things, uh, if they're not able to, to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other. Whether it's through prevention or, or treatment or, you know, just, uh, just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves.
A:	Right.
B:	It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it.
A:	That's true.
B:	But
A:	You know the, the other thought that I had, uh,
A:	I've had several minutes to think about this after I, uh,
A:	while I was finding people, I, uh, I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it,
A:	so it's kind of a, a typo: that for than unfair advantage, as it were,
A:	but, the other thing that I thought of on this is, I wonder if there isn't enough money, uh, in our economy or in our system.
A:	Uh, it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good.
A:	I mean, yeah,
A:	they're kind of nice.
A:	But, we have such an affluent society , society that I wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything.
B:	Just change our
A:	Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people,
A:	but that's
B:	Right,
B:	just change our priorities a little bit.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza
A:	or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other
A:	and then you have all the arts that, that are nice and aesthetic,
A:	but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	They certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that,
A:	but, uh, had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else,
A:	All right, this is easy for me since I,
B:	And me too, because I eat out a lot.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I travel,
A:	I do about forty percent of my time is on the road.
B:	So you eat all your meals out.
A:	I eat a lot of meals out,
A:	well I'm also married
A:	and my wife is an A one cook,
A:	but she enjoys eating out,
A:	so I have to share it with her.
A:	And, uh, actually it's very easy for me, because I, I have a make it a practice when I am out,
A:	I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here.
B:	Sure.
A:	So, I look for just about anything,
A:	and it's, it's, uh, it's a lot of fun.
A:	I don't have to worry, really worry too much about price considerations because I, you know,
B:	I was going to ask you, could you go to, you know, nice places,
B:	and,
A:	Oh, sure,
A:	yeah,
A:	and it's, it's really great.
A:	I, I, I like different types of food.
B:	So where are your, what are the places, you know, memorable places you've eaten?
A:	Uh, oh you okay you name it.
A:	Let's see,
A:	you've got one down in, uh, down near, uh, Addison,
A:	uh, there's two restaurants that I particularly like that I, every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta, Georgia, I make sure I go,
A:	and that's Houston's.
B:	Oh, Houston's,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yep,
A:	okay.
B:	It's a great place.
A:	It's, it's great.
A:	There's a, a restaurant in, um, right outside of Reading, Pennsylvania, it's called Alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it is fantastic.
A:	Uh, there's a restaurant, and I don't recall the name of it, uh, in, uh, Panama City.
A:	Of course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama City, uh, Panama, the country, uh, Panama.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	because I was thinking,
B:	well, I, I grew up in Panama City.
A:	No
A:	this is the country this is the country Panama, all right?
B:	I get it.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, but I have gotten to quite a few.
A:	And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there.
A:	I, you know, and I know the locations,
A:	and I know the places,
A:	but I, lot of times I don't remember the names.
A:	I'd have to go back through some expense reports.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But particularly, down in your area, I'm looking for some, some more restaurants.
A:	So, I, you know, I don't know what's, what's down there,  the ones out in Addison.
B:	Do you like Mexican?
B:	Do you like Mexican food.
A:	Not particularly
B:	Oh.
A:	that's one of the few,
A:	why, which one were you going to recommend?
B:	Well, I mean, there's so many places here, you know,
B:	there's just, it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But in the Addison, well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi
A:	Okay,
A:	I have a,
B:	that has a great, I've not been there, but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas,
B:	and now there's one in Addison.
A:	Okay,
A:	let,
A:	I'm, I'm writing it down
B:	It's F, S it's S F U Z I.
A:	Okay.
B:	And it's on, it's in Addison,
B:	and it's a great place.
B:	Also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copelands.
A:	I've been there.
B:	Now I really like Copelands.
A:	Okay,
A:	I've been there.
A:	Um, one down there is the, uh, I think it's an old schoolhouse.
B:	Oh, the, yeah, the, I know,
B:	no,
B:	I don't like that place.
A:	Well, I like the food,
A:	but I don't care for the clowning around.
B:	See, uh, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I, when I went, I thought the food was not good.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Oh I've had,
B:	Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of,
A:	That's it,
A:	that's it.
A:	I've had excellent food there.
B:	See, I, when I went, I thought,
B:	the people drove me crazy first of all
A:	True.
A:	True.
B:	but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	all right,
A:	well, that's great.
A:	Uh, no,
A:	Italian is fine.
A:	I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in
B:	Do you like, like Southwestern?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact.
A:	All right.
A:	Really?
B:	And, um, it's great,
B:	I mean, their, they have, I think,
B:	sometimes I've been when I thought, Well, it wasn't as good,
B:	but I went there recently,
B:	and I thought, Well, this really is good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's, that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.
A:	Good.
B:	And, um,
A:	Well, this is great.
A:	This is going to give me  some more places to go.
B:	A whole new,  dining experience.
A:	Okay,
A:	fine.
A:	I guess our time's about up,
A:	so.
B:	Well, they haven't beeped us, have they?
A:	Uh, well, they don't always.
B:	Oh, I thought sometimes they say, you know this is three minutes or whatever.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I they've been doing that when, uh, the circuits are busy
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and other than that, they, you know, leave you go about five minutes,
A:	and then, that, that's about it.
A:	I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat,
A:	so.
B:	Okay,
A:	It was a pleasure talking to you.
B:	Well, thanks for calling for helping us out.
A:	Okay.
A:	You bet,
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	So do you have any recycling programs there?
B:	Um, I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we're a pretty small town
B:	and, uh, the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that show, you know, plastics, paper liter bottles, et cetera, et cetera.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We've progressed a little bit farther than that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, actually they have, uh,
A:	parts of town,
A:	it may have even spread all over the whole town,
A:	and, um, they will have these green bins
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's just as standard as a, a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, just along with a trash can you have this, this green plastic bin,
A:	and you put your bottles in it and paper and, uh, you know, all those things that
A:	aluminum.
A:	You know, anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, I guess you can
A:	and a lot of the restaurants they just have, uh, places where you can throw away, especially beer places, where you can throw away green bottles, and then the brown bottles.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, uh, oh, I don't know,
A:	I guess they're, you know, clear bottles.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, um, you know a lot of people do have those separated.
A:	And, of course, they have the, um, dumpsters, uh, the, the igloos.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and they have those strategically placed around the city.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, they're, they're actually going to extend it, I think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh, that would be good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	things of that nature.
A:	So, I guess when you live in a bigger city it, it really becomes, uh, necessary.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see, it's not anywhere near that.
B:	Uh, we, you know,
B:	as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But that's as far as we go
B:	because I take them to a girl at work,
B:	and she goes and cashes them in because, you know,
B:	I just I can do that for her
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
A:	Huh.
B:	see we don't have anything here in Belton.
B:	It's, it's a pretty small little town.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
B:	So, you know, that's about all the, that we're doing here.
B:	Uh, they're, uh, getting a little bit more on,
B:	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle, and what can you recycle and what you can't. Because, you know, not a lot of people do really know what, you know, what it's for.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're doing a real good job of, uh, separating it here.
A:	And, of course, there you know you have a specific place to put your paper.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, they try to get you to go ahead and separate it,
A:	but they actually have the door to door pickup.
A:	Um, and it's, uh, I think it started out to be, um, just kind of a test, a pilot project.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it went over so well that they just extended it.
A:	And it's almost, uh,
A:	I don't know if it's done by a private company or not.
A:	It may be.
A:	But, uh, they just go around to each, uh, door and pick it up.
B:	Wow, that's excellent.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's good.
A:	Let's see.
A:	Oh, and every year, of course, the phone books um, they tell everybody across the city to, uh, put all their phone books in, uh, the, uh, recycle bins.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Because, you know, phone books are pretty,
A:	well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are .
A:	And sometimes you might have two or three.
B:	Exactly.
A:	So, uh, that's, that's a big savings right there in itself.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see ours just goes in the regular trash.
A:	Yeah,
B:	It just, you know, there's not a whole lot.
A:	huh.
B:	And there are, you know, some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But usually it's, it, it hasn't caught on yet.
B:	I'm hoping it will soon.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, the thing about newspapers and paper,
A:	recycled paper is actually very expensive.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, when you see something that's on recycled paper, they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that.
A:	It's, uh,
A:	they're not coming out ahead at all.
A:	It's, uh, it's really a cost.
B:	Huh. I wasn't totally aware of that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	I mean it, it sounds good to the public
A:	but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something.
A:	Now, aluminum I don't know.
A:	They may be coming out ahead.
A:	But I know, for a fact that the paper, uh, on that end they're not, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's just good to recycle
A:	but it's, uh, not to their advantage.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it costs less.
B:	Huh. Well,
A:	I can't think of anything else.
B:	I can't either. Because we're, we're at a very, you know, beginning stages,
A:	Okay.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We look forward to it to get better .
A:	Well, I hope you all, um, uh, come along a little farther in the future.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me too.
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	You too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Supposed to talk about boats.
A:	Have you got a boat
B:	No,
B:	I don't,
B:	do you?
A:	No,
A:	I don't.
A:	I, I've had one for quite a few years,
A:	but I, I've not had one the last couple of years.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	But, it's something I've always enjoyed.
A:	Do you, do you like boating?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I love them
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh, my children all have been grown for a few years
A:	and we were using it less and less and less,
A:	so we decided to sell it.
A:	And,
B:	Well, I heard, that's the second happiest day of your life
A:	What's that?
B:	The day you sell your boat.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	now I loved having a boat.
A:	I loved having it.
A:	No,
B:	No,
B:	I just heard that.
B:	That's just a joke, I guess.
A:	Oh, okay
B:	First best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it
B:	but, I'd like to have one.
A:	Oh, yeah
B:	I just don't know if I'd have the time to use it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	guy just you know,
A:	he needs his weekends free, or to be able to use it or a day during the week or something,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, but, no
A:	I guess for the cost of them you don't really,
A:	it's hard to get,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I felt like I got my money's worth out of mine
A:	I had bought it used and kept it, uh, I don't know, ten years and got within, uh, three hundred dollars of what, when I sold it, of what I'd paid for it and had it all those years, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So they hold their, you take care of them they hold their value real well.
B:	Really?
A:	So, you know, you couldn't complain about that.
B:	Did you go fishing?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	it was a uh, big boat, big ski boat type thing.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I had a hundred, hundred sixty horse, uh, Murcruiser in it.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	Inboard outboard.
A:	Oh, I did fish out of it occasionally,
A:	but I'm not too much of a fisherman.
B:	Really?
A:	And, uh, but I but I did enjoy owning a boat,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like to fish.
A:	would recommend it to anybody.
A:	And, uh, uh, but, uh, and now sailing, I've never been sailing.
A:	Have you been sailing?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I've sailed some.
B:	I just like, uh, fourteen foot Sunfish.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Nothing big.
A:	I've never tried.
A:	I've always thought, I bet that would be more fun.
A:	But I'd want to be with a skilled sailor
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
A:	But it,
B:	Well, they offer classes out at, uh, Ray Hubbard.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I, I've always thought I'd like to.
A:	I've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, at this stage of the game, I'm not that interested in it anymore.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	We go out with friends on the,
A:	we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon
A:	and parents' next door neighbors have a big barge
B:	Okay.
A:	and we go out and take them out on their barge.
A:	They're getting kind of old
A:	and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often,
A:	so we we get out on the water occasionally, you know.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, uh, anyway, it's it's, it's fun.
A:	I, I do enjoy the lake,
A:	but, uh, once the children were grown,
A:	and we'd go down there
A:	and I'd get the boat out on the, you know, Saturday,
A:	and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much.
A:	It's such a pretty lake down there.
A:	We'd enjoy it so much
A:	and, I'd say, well, I'm going to leave the boat out, because, uh, we'll probably do this again tomorrow
A:	It got to where the, tomorrow the boat was still sitting there
A:	and we never did go out again
A:	and I'd have to go load it up the next day.
A:	And,
B:	Where is that?
A:	Uh, Mount Vernon.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Cypress Springs,
A:	Cypress Creek Springs.
B:	Okay,
B:	that's south of here?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's down at Mount Vernon.
B:	Okay.
A:	It's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's just a hundred miles from here.
B:	Huh. What do you take, I Thirty-five?
A:	No,
A:	you go down I, uh, uh, you, uh, you go down, uh, yeah, thirty, thirty.
B:	Thirty.
A:	It's east of here.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	East of here.
A:	Hundred miles due east of here.
B:	All right.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it just we just moved down here a couple years ago,
B:	so,
A:	Did you?
A:	Where did you all move from?
B:	Colorado Springs.
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	How are you liking it?
B:	Oh, we love it up there
A:	Well, good.
B:	That's where I grew up
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, we're, we like it down here pretty good.
A:	Oh, I think you'll like it better,
A:	but, of course it's hard when you don't have any family around.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we got two kids that are under two
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	it's hard on the your folks, too,
A:	I know.
A:	They're all, yours
A:	and your wife's folks still live in Colorado?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Uh, there are supposed to be, uh, some people moving down here from Colorado Springs for T I.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	supposed to be.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right. Uh,
A:	Do you work at T I?
B:	I don't,
B:	no.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, a friend of mine's dad is, was a program manager up there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he just moved down here to
B:	what do you,
B:	I guess it's,
B:	he's working in McKinney.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't either.
A:	My wife does
B:	Okay.
A:	But, it's a good company.
A:	But, anyway, we're supposed to be talking about boats,
A:	so back to boats.
A:	So, tell me the last time you went for a boat ride.
B:	Well, actually, I went, uh, canoeing down the Brazos this weekend.
A:	Oh, my gosh, now that had to be, that's boating.
A:	That had to have been fun.
B:	It was fun,
B:	it was fun.
A:	Well, what are your hobbies?
B:	Well, actually my hobbies now are T shirt making.
B:	I'm making T shirts and sweat shirts.
B:	In fact that's what I was doing when you called.
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
A:	What kinds of, uh, sweat shirts and T shirts do you make?
B:	Um, right now I'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing.
A:	Okay.
A:	Is that silk screening, or,
B:	Um, no,
B:	I'm, have material that I cut out,
B:	and then you, um,
B:	there's this stuff called Wonder Under that you that you iron it on
B:	and then you iron that on the T shirt, and you paint around it.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	So, it's real fun.
B:	I started doing it as a, um, just something fun to do,
B:	and now I'm selling them and pretty,
A:	Well, how's it going?
B:	Pretty good.
B:	I just started last week,
B:	and I sold seven.
B:	I didn't, wasn't expecting that,
B:	so,
A:	Well, that sounds great.
B:	I guess in my spare time I'll be making T shirts
B:	So.
A:	Well, somebody has to do it,
B:	That's right, you know.
A:	Give you a little Christmas money, any way.
B:	That's correct.
B:	Well, what are your hobbies?
A:	Well, I, I kind of have hobby fads, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When I was growing up I was, was into coin collecting,
A:	and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty, I guess,
A:	and then, my hobbies in high school went just to the sports.
A:	Now my latest one is classic cars.
A:	I've I had a sixty-six Mustang I was rebuilding.
B:	Um.
A:	Almost had it done,
A:	and I went on, went ahead and sold it.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	But it was fun.
A:	I really enjoyed it.
B:	Well, how'd you learn to do that to fix them up?
A:	Oh, you just,
B:	You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what?
A:	No,
A:	you just kind of,
A:	all I did is, uh, I bought the car
A:	and then, uh, you know, you can,
A:	I, uh, was just in a supermarket
A:	and I seen a, a magazine for, you know,
A:	basically it, it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE
A:	and and so I bought it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they had, uh, some names, some companies that sold mustang parts,
A:	and I just started ordering some parts
A:	and, and, you know, basically, you know, I, what I did was, I redid the whole interior.
A:	I didn't do too much to the engine, because the engine was pretty good, but the, the whole interior and then part of the exterior,
A:	just kind of do it.
B:	Where'd you get the car?
A:	Well, we lived, we lived in South Dakota,
A:	and I bought it up there before I moved down here.
B:	Wow.
A:	So it was, it was kind of rusted out there,
A:	there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here.
B:	Well, that's true,
B:	that's true.
B:	Well that sounds neat.
A:	Well, gee I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies.
B:	Let's see.
A:	That, that about covers mine
A:	and T shirt making about covers yours.
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	I've done other hobbies.
B:	I'm a hobby person.
B:	I've always done a lot of craft stuff.
B:	I always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that,
B:	and, I collect dolls,
B:	I have a huge collection of dolls which is still in New Mexico with my parents
A:	In New Mexico?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	from New Mexico.
A:	Okay.
B:	So. Let's see,
B:	what else?
B:	I started collecting music boxes.
B:	I guess that's a hobby.
A:	Yeah
A:	that is.
B:	So.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	How many music boxes do you have?
B:	Probably uh, about twenty.
A:	Do they all play different songs
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or do some of them play the same song?
B:	They, they all play different songs.
A:	Well, that's neat.
A:	What's the most expensive one you bought?
B:	The most expensive.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I've gotten all of them for gifts.
B:	I don't
A:	Oh, really.
B:	bought a few of them.
B:	I usually get them for Christmas gifts or, and like when people go, you know, to, on trips or something.
A:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	It used to be tea spoons, was the thing.
B:	That's true
B:	I never collected those, never collected those.
A:	Well, that's interesting, music boxes.
B:	I have dolls from all over too.
B:	That I started when I was a little girl,
B:	and I have a lot of dolls.
A:	.
B:	People would always bring them when they go to the countries,
B:	and, um, and I did that when I went to Europe one summer.
B:	I bought a doll everywhere we went
B:	so.
A:	Well how was Europe?
B:	economy.
B:	It was great,
B:	it was quick.
B:	I was in, I was in high school,
B:	and I was in a tour,
B:	and we went all,
B:	it's kind of a, it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries,
B:	and, um, it was called People to People,
B:	and we'd stay in people's homes,
B:	and then we got to also tour big cities,
B:	and I really enjoyed it.
A:	Was that in high school
B:	Uh-huh
A:	or was that a college thing?
B:	in was in high school.
B:	So I'd like to go back, because we had, you know,
B:	everything was rushed
A:	I bet.
B:	everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day,
B:	but but it really,
A:	Right.
A:	That's where a camcorder would come in handy.
B:	Exactly,
B:	that's true.
A:	Well that sounds real neat.
A:	So you, you haven't been back to Europe since then, huh?
B:	No,
B:	I always thought I would,
B:	but who knows now.
B:	I got married and, maybe some day.
B:	Maybe it's one of those retirement things
A:	There you go.
A:	Well, does you husband, uh,
A:	what does he think of your, uh, T shirts and,
B:	Well, he likes it all right.
B:	He's been pretty good, because there's T shirt stuff all over the house.
A:	Does he help out much
A:	or,
A:	What kind of car would you like to buy next?
B:	Well, I guess Cadillac.
B:	I guess that's kind of everybody's dream
A:	Well, why would that be?
B:	Oh, I guess it's a General Motors product,
B:	and I like General Motors because they're made in the United States,
B:	and, uh, we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them.
A:	Okay,
A:	well that's good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	If you had, uh, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy?
B:	Oh, um, I think I'd still go with the Cadillac.
A:	Do you?
B:	I don't, I don't care about a big fancy, fancy
A:	Which type of Cadillac, uh, is your favorite?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
B:	I guess the Seville, probably or.
A:	The Seville.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's a sharp looking car.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That really is.
A:	It, it always has been though. You know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they have been.
A:	it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness.
A:	It never really has.
A:	It's always had it's own unique look.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I've always liked that.
A:	I liked the, the
A:	one year they had, a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	I thought, now that looks sharp
B:	Yeah.
A:	that looks real sharp.
B:	Well, I think the ones now with all of the, uh, fancy gold lettering and all, you know, I think they're very pretty.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And course the top, now the what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, the,
A:	I, I've never really, uh, I've never ridden in one recently, um,
A:	but they're supposed to be just real smooth.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just a nice comfortable ride.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are,
B:	and, uh, they, they're just always,
B:	they, they look like they're sturdy you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they look like they're very sturdy,
B:	and you don't have to worry that much about, um, getting, you know, hurt like you would in a small one.
A:	Right.
A:	Now they've got a unique uh, feature in them now.
A:	If, uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside.
A:	It'll go underneath the car instead.
B:	Oh, I didn't know that.
A:	So that's, that's a big safety factor they've got in them now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I suppose they all have the balloons.
A:	The air bags,
A:	yeah.
B:	The air bags,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well.
A:	So,
A:	well that's great,
A:	that's great,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products .
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do.
B:	Um, I, I go for things, you know, built in the United States rather than foreign countries.
A:	Right.
B:	Help our economy
B:	and,
A:	What kind of, uh, General Motors cars have you had in the past?
B:	Mostly Oldsmobiles.
A:	Oldsmobiles.
A:	Those are real nice riding cars too.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's what we have now,
B:	but of course if I have a choice I'd still have the Cadillac
B:	but, uh, I've been very satisfied with the, with the Oldsmobiles.
B:	We've driven them for about probably twenty years.
A:	Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	the Ninety-Eight.
A:	The Ninety-Eight,
A:	okay.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Well, I don't think,
A:	uh, let's see,
A:	the Ninety-Eight,
A:	now that's got that big V eight engine in it, doesn't it, doesn't it?
B:	Well I don't know.
B:	The one we have has a six.
A:	Has a little V Six?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	But it's a very good car.
B:	It's a had, not had one minute's problem with it,
A:	It,
B:	and I've had, now I have twenty-three thousand miles on it.
A:	Oh, that's great
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's great.
A:	That's always nice to get, uh, reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending, you know, anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for, for a single item. You know,
B:	Right.
A:	you just don't want any hassles with it.
B:	No.
A:	You just, you expect it to do its, its job,
A:	and I think a lot of, a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into don't take that into consideration you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	They just expect you to buy their product,
A:	but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Price is, is an issue,
A:	but it's not the most important issue.
B:	No,
B:	it really isn't, because now you can get like five year financing on them
B:	and so, um,
A:	Right.
B:	but I, I, I would go with the General Motors any time.
A:	Well, I've always been a Ford man, myself.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	But that's all right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well sure.
A:	You know, it's American made too which is good.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but I, I've,
A:	ever since I guess I, I was growing up, my dad's always had Fords,
A:	and, uh, well, I grew up in South Dakota.
A:	So everybody has a truck
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and my Ford trucks have just,
A:	I've, I've just never had problems with them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I honestly think I would die before my truck would, keel over on me.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Well, I,
B:	yeah,
B:	those are good products also.
B:	Um, let's see,
B:	My T V down.
B:	Okay.
B:	I'm sorry.
A:	Uh, invasions of privacy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	All,  sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
B:	I hate those canned messages they put on my recorder.
A:	Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen
A:	just what went into the
A:	something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using
A:	and, uh, and, uh, people, businesses would be prohibited, uh, from calling for for, for business selling you things.
B:	I have through,  the phone company, uh,
A:	I'm sure that's true.
B:	no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received.
A:	Uh, some of did too.
A:	I think, I think government can do that now,
A:	is that right?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, especially with, with possibly children around.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, that could, could be useful protection.
B:	Right.
B:	Yes,
B:	and I don't have children around
B:	but I just don't like those nine hundred numbers.
B:	So,  I've excluded those.
A:	So, uh, I used to deal with,
B:	But isn't, it does not stop you from the, uh, dialing services.
A:	What are dialing services?
B:	Where they, uh, intend to sell you things.
A:	Oh, oh, where people just, just call you.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And leave again that canned message on the,
A:	And you know, and then what, those problems has been eliminated
A:	those problems used to be when I used a credit card they'd want to have my phone number.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I did not like giving it out.
A:	I gave out my work number
B:	Right.
A:	but I think I'm not sure if it's by law just,
A:	otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number.
B:	Well, that's the thing I hated too about, uh, Radio Shack.
A:	How did Radio Shack work?
B:	If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number.
B:	And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning,
B:	and, and I don't give that out.
B:	I have an unlisted number
B:	so I don't,
A:	Yes,
A:	that's, that's, that's one solution
A:	but you, you, you nonetheless often get, get people calling you?
B:	Sure.
A:	Despite the fact that your number is unlisted?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you actually have your number
A:	or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours?
B:	Well, anything that you buy um, you you may get put on the, a, uh, preferred list that is purchased.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and companies can purchase this list
B:	and what that is is people who buy from the mail.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll be thinking in mind the address is ,
A:	um, is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number?
B:	Uh, no.
B:	Not really.
B:	Um, no.
B:	Uh, some of that unfortunately is legal.
B:	So they can't stop people from, uh, advertising
B:	and that, and that's what it falls under.
B:	It falls under the guise of advertising.
B:	So, I don't care for it,
B:	but is it a legal, uh, solution for some companies.
B:	So that, that's the way things are.
A:	Huh. Yeah.
A:	I don't know.
A:	I think it's gotten much worse the last,  few years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists.
B:	Well, they, you know,
B:	that's, that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy.
B:	You've got the holy rollers
B:	and you've got, uh, all kinds of people knocking on your door and, who want to, uh, either direct you to the right path or, or want to, uh, sell you, uh, paper routes, uh, whatever,
B:	so, um,  you know, it's not just the telephone.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Sell you magazines.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess whatever is,
A:	I just don't give,
A:	For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	so it's right up your alley, then.
A:	I suppose so.
A:	Let me push the button.
B:	All right.
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system,
A:	but, uh, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think it's going to happen either,
B:	but I wish it were
B:	because I'm a, I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm at grad school now in acoustics
B:	and all we do is metric stuff.
A:	You're now in what?
B:	Acoustics.
A:	Acoustics, uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so everything's metric
B:	and then you go to read some order book or something
B:	and it's all confusing
B:	so I don't understand as much,
B:	so I think we should get one adopted permanently.
A:	Well, I guess that is the policy,
A:	but it's been the policy for a long time
A:	and nothing ever happens.
A:	Uh, I suppose things, some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation come up that's more used to it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to.
A:	They have to for international trade.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I guess it's, it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because of, of, uh, of computers coming into everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.
B:	I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms.
B:	Because someone says a kilogram,
B:	no one knows what that is.
A:	Everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I, I, I don't see that, it, it, it can change it very quickly.
A:	I mean we're not the kind of society that, that, uh, that something can be posed upon, uh, by government will.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no one seems to be adopting it.
B:	Metric system, no one's very, uh, no one wants it at all seems like.
A:	Uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, uh, money, dollar, coins, anything like that.
B:	Yeah
A:	And, and, and it it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in, in using the old system.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused, though.
B:	I think two systems is worse than one, though
B:	Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things
B:	and they're half english and half metric
B:	and you, you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems.
B:	just get one.
B:	I prefer metric,
B:	but even if it's english, they should just have one.
A:	Well, I mean, I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day.
B:	Yeah
B:	yeah,
B:	I think so.
B:	Your, your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination.
A:	Uh, I mean, there are things you could do.
A:	Uh, we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but that hasn't been adopted very widely.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they have some of those in Ohio.
B:	There's this one sign's kind of funny.
B:	It says, uh, metric signs next hundred miles.
A:	But, I mean, and no one will, will go a step further to remove the english signs.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that would force everybody to use it. Or to quit selling tape measures in inches.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, uh, eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess a hundred is sixty-two.
A:	Hundred car is going sixty-two,
A:	yeah,
A:	so it would be more like, uh, like ninety I guess,
A:	car is going fifty-five.
A:	Uh, you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety
A:	Do, do, do you know, where you are,
A:	do the schools emphasize the metric system?
B:	Yeah,
B:	in the engineering they all do pretty much.
A:	No,
A:	I, I, I meant, I meant down, like, in the elementary schools.
B:	Oh, in the elementary schools.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I wouldn't think so.
B:	I remember a ways back we did like conversions,
A:	I mean, I think,
B:	but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, I think my children learned the metric system,
A:	but it doesn't get, get emphasized over the other.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they learn how many centimeters are in an inch
B:	and that's about it.
A:	Okay,
A:	we're supposed to talk about vacations.
B:	Right,
B:	so, uh, well, uh, what kind of vacations do you like?
A:	Well, uh, I haven't been to many places,
A:	but I have a opportunity to go to, uh, Paris, France, uh, with, uh, with my friend in April.
A:	She is, her, uh, her family, you know, lives there,
A:	and she's only been there once.
A:	Her grandmother lives there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I'm hoping to I'm praying I get to go. Uh,
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you ever been to, uh, like New Mexico?
B:	Uh, no, actually.
A:	Oh.
B:	Why, have you?
A:	I was curious.
A:	I was just wondering what it was like.
B:	Oh, okay
B:	No, uh,
B:	I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and, uh,
A:	Tahiti?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Tahiti,
A:	oh.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	Haiti.
A:	Oh, Haiti.
B:	Right.
A:	Where is that?
B:	It's, uh, well, it's in the Caribbean
B:	and it's the western half of an island,
B:	with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	that turned out to be a really good experience for me.
A:	So, what did you do when you were in Europe?
B:	Uh, well, see, I went there when I was in high school, actually
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.
A:	What did you do on the farm?
B:	Uh, uh, uh, well, not that much
B:	Just, uh,
A:	Are you just kind of sight, just kind of, uh,
B:	Right,
B:	I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything
B:	But I, you know, drove a tractor, helped them weed beets and that sort of thing.
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, yep,
B:	and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home
B:	and that was pretty interesting.
B:	And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were, uh, staying for their vacation in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, like right across from England.
A:	Um.
B:	Uh, so, uh, where in France are you,
A:	Paris.
B:	Right,
B:	Paris.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, um, how long do you plan to be going for?
A:	Uh, two weeks.
A:	Last time she stayed two months,
A:	but we're only going to stay two weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Great.
B:	And, uh,
A:	We're going to take a cooking class there,
A:	so that might be fun.
B:	A what?
A:	Cooking class, you know,
A:	French cooking.
B:	Oh, great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, what else are you planning to do, if anything?
A:	Museums, you know,
A:	go to museums and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, um,
A:	Do you go to museums in Europe?
B:	Uh, actually, no,
B:	I don't think I went to any of them.
B:	Uh, the closest thing I did was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.
A:	Um.
B:	That, there is some on that west coast of France
B:	and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany.
A:	Um, that's neat.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was nice.
B:	Uh, um, but, so, uh,
A:	Hey,
A:	what about,
A:	have you ever been to Hawaii?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I haven't.
A:	No?
B:	Have you?
A:	No.
B:	Okay
B:	Well, uh, well,
A:	I'm wanting to go there.
B:	Where have you gone first?
A:	Oh, where have I gone that's anywhere.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean,
A:	Uh,
B:	All right,
B:	well.
A:	Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?
A:	Uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think that you're absolutely right there.
B:	The other thing is, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh,
A:	And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly. Um,
A:	And that's got to be paid.
B:	Exactly,
B:	and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.
B:	Um, I'm not really, uh, sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that needs to be paid, or the tax that's currently being paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.
A:	It can only hurt the deficit picture.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	Um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, uh, bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	So that, that, that's the current predicament.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it seems like it's, it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two.
B:	I mean, it's, it's the, um,
B:	my understanding is what they're what, what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, uh,
B:	and if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn will generate revenue.
B:	But it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a an unending spiral,
B:	and it, it, it, uh,
B:	I'm, I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point.
A:	It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do.
A:	Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has, with interest rates.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that's been a positive development.
B:	I think what that's done is it's, it's, it's help keep inflation from, um, uh,
A:	Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	That's the sort of upside to the deficit.
B:	It's a sort of a piece of luck.
A:	That's the upside to the recession.
B:	Yeah, um.
B:	I don't know,
B:	what kind of things do you think can be done in, in, uh, in the long term?
A:	Well, can be done or will be done are two different things.
A:	Um, at various places to look for, for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation.
B:	Sure.
A:	But there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.
A:	Uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, uh, they should put a, in
A:	the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, I think to make, to make, uh, reductions there.
A:	Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.
B:	Right.
B:	I think that, I think that, that I agree with you certainly in the second situation,
B:	and I think certain entitlements I, I'm inclined to agree with you, too.
B:	Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um, uh,
A:	A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician well, and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition, uh, and the school gets paid off immediately, uh
B:	Oh, I see, I see what you're saying.
B:	And then they  and then the people default on the loans.
A:	and then they don't provide very much education.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh,
B:	and I, I, I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,
B:	but, but taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay
B:	what kind of  foods would you have?
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, well, I like to cook, um
B:	Oh, I do too
A:	but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it, just because, um, uh, it's too much pressure. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can't enjoy it.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
B:	That's, that's what,
B:	I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's,
A:	Exactly.
B:	everybody just says how wonderful it is,
B:	and it's it's like, uh, yes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's one of those things I got famous for in college.
B:	People would come and say could would you come over and make lasagna for me
A:	Uh-huh
B:	It's like, well, I can't really give you a recipe, uh
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	you'd just do it.
B:	I can I can just do it
A:	.
B:	I like doing that kind of stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it's, it's fun,
B:	in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We just had a bunch of people over
B:	and we had, we did lasagna and garlic bread and, uh, yummy.
A:	Um. Boy I like that.
B:	Uh, I do too, in fact
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I'm planning a,
A:	and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, good.
A:	So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
B:	Uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And have, you know, like three or four couples come over,
B:	and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's, it's inexpensive
A:	Yeah.
B:	plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it,
B:	and you got a great dinner.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good idea.
B:	It's, it's real easy,
B:	I like doing that part.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	and it's,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that, it's, it's fine, because then I can just say, Okay fine,
B:	you bring this,
B:	you bring this,
B:	you bring this,
B:	we're done.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it's pretty cool.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
A:	Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's very easy to.
B:	Oh.
A:	You don't like it?
B:	Oh, I love it
A:	Oh, you do,
A:	okay,
A:	yeah.
A:	I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken
A:	and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan,
A:	you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
B:	Um.
A:	and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over
A:	and you can put mushrooms in if you want,
A:	and then you just.
B:	Over the uncooked rice?
A:	Yeah,
A:	over uncooked rice
B:	Oh.
A:	and you can either microwave it
A:	or do it in the oven,
A:	and it just.
B:	Oh, how neat.
A:	It fluffs up,
A:	and it's really moist.
B:	Huh.
B:	Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	wow,
A:	yeah.
B:	And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes
B:	and I'll put in there,
B:	and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person
B:	but I like it,
B:	it adds something to the chicken.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then just bake it,
B:	and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.
A:	Well, I'll keep that one in mind.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um,
B:	yeah
A:	Yeah.
B:	I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	or, you know semi .
B:	But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You put in, um
B:	Um.
A:	let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice
A:	or,
B:	Um.
A:	It depends on,
A:	you can really vary it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But you have to put the water in proportionally.
A:	I can't remember.
A:	I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I use that for for rice
B:	and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.
A:	Yeah,
A:	flavor.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um. Now that would be good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How long do you have to bake it?
A:	Um, let's see.
A:	I think it was an hour.
A:	I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.
B:	I do, I do microwave too, a lot
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, I think it's about an hour.
B:	How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
A:	Or maybe it's only half hour.
A:	Um, you just,
A:	until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
A:	Yeah.
B:	or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
A:	Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
B:	Um.
B:	Ooh, this is a beneficial call.
B:	I like this
A:	Yeah,
A:	I liked your idea too, there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but that one's an easy one.
B:	It's like, just put in,
B:	a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it, it makes a great,
B:	I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old
B:	and they love it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, because my daughter calls it her gravy
B:	and I mean, she thinks it's wonderful,
B:	my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to,
A:	Uh, did you watch the Bulls this morning?
B:	You know what,
B:	I watched a little bit of, uh, of the Bulls game
B:	and I, uh, had to leave.
B:	Uh, in fact I, I think the Bulls were ahead when I, uh, when I left.
B:	Who won the game?
A:	They won in a squeaker.
A:	They won by they won by two points.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Uh, they were behind as they headed into each quarter
A:	and then they came back in the second half
A:	and at the end, I think they were, uh, looked, they looked like they were closing it out
A:	and then Detroit kept coming back
A:	and uh, Isaiah missed a three point attempt, at the end
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I think the Bulls won by two.
A:	I think they do, as a matter of fact.
B:	Yeah.
A:	One of the, uh, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would, uh, if they continued at their current pace, uh, set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season.
B:	Wow.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they looked real good
A:	and,
B:	They, they do,
B:	and they, you know,
B:	I think by, uh, by relieving some of the pressure off of, uh, of, uh, uh,
B:	Michael Jordan really helped them out.
B:	You know, he doesn't have, they don't have to rely on him to score you know, thirty or forty points at every  at every game
A:	Right.
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they, they're, they're balancing their attack
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	I'm,
B:	yeah,
B:	I saw the I saw the Warriors, uh, just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors, uh, Dallas game.
A:	I saw the, the second half of the game last night
A:	and they were impressive.
B:	They look good.
A:	Billy Owens looks like he was,
A:	that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him.
B:	Yeah,
B:	now, I don't, uh, I haven't kept up with what was going on with, uh, with the,
A:	Well, they traded away, uh, Mitch Richmond,
A:	or is it Tim Hardaway.
A:	One of the two, uh, who, along with, uh, Chris Mullen was, you know,
A:	though three were three of the best in the N B A,
A:	and and, they made a heck of a threesome
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens
A:	and, uh,
B:	Good move.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, yeah,
A:	he's really worked out well.
A:	They've got the Warriors have got a team, uh,
A:	and, uh, I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do.
A:	They're ahead,
A:	and the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth, uh, position in the west
A:	and I don't know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	in the east, I don't know, uh,
A:	is it Boston in, uh, first place?
B:	Uh, I think Boston's in first.
B:	Uh, I, you know, I haven't kept up with any of the other, uh, teams.
B:	I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks, you know.
A:	Boy,
A:	they've had a hard time.
A:	They said  they've lost a lot of squeakers.
B:	Oh, man!
B:	That,
B:	well, yeah,
B:	but, I mean, just this whole year has been just disastrous for them
B:	and, uh, you know, they're going, I, I think they're going for an all time record of how many you know, losses in a row they can, they they can, uh, pull out.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's unbelievable.
A:	How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.
A:	Do you, for example, like San  Antonio in Dallas?
B:	Uh,
B:	Well, actually, actually, the, the, the Dallas area here, uh, pulls for Dallas.
B:	Uh, San Antonio pulls for San Antonio,
B:	and Houston pulls for, for the Rockets.
A:	So there isn't much crossover, huh,
B:	There really,
B:	I mean, not a whole lot. You know,
B:	I mean, you find them, they're, find them be, to be pretty loyal, uh, in, with the local teams.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, you know, it's kind of, I guess it's kind of like, uh, there in the Bay area, you know, you don't find a whole lot of, uh, of Sacramento fans.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's true,
A:	because San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they?
B:	Really isn't,
B:	uh-uh.
A:	No.
B:	It's, you know, it's, it's about the same, uh, same distance from here to to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento.
A:	Is it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	so it's not something you'd drive,
B:	So it's, yeah, it's not really a local, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing.
B:	Uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio
B:	and they, I mean, they have got a great club. You know.
A:	They've done a good job.
A:	I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him certainly,
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah
B:	that always makes a big difference.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, that's
B:	So,
A:	I think the way it, uh, I think that's the way it works now in basketball.
A:	You, you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and, you know, uh, Bird for the, for the, uh, Celtics
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	And, you know, uh, you know, I used to think that, that one, one player really doesn't make a club,
B:	but it really does, you know.
A:	Well, it ,
B:	You get somebody like Magic
B:	and you can see the decline in that team.
A:	Well, yeah.
B:	Once he left, you know, it's, it's just not the same, uh, it's not the same team.
B:	There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for.
A:	Well, I think you're right
A:	and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit
A:	and I think those things do make a difference
A:	and there are marquee players.
A:	And I think  I think Jordan and the, and the Bulls have to be, uh, considered the likely favorites.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I don't know who would meet them in the west.
A:	Uh, I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year.
A:	They were so
B:	Who won that Portland game?
A:	You know, I wasn't, I, I I watched only a few minutes of it
A:	and I wasn't paying attention.
A:	Uh, and so I don't know, uh,
B:	Uh,
A:	But Phoenix, you know, Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs
A:	and,
B:	Well I guess we're, uh, forced to finally, to do a lot about air pollution.
B:	I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars
B:	and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels.
A:	Yeah,
A:	one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from?  Or sources.
B:	I, you know, I assume,  that the major sources are cars and factories.
A:	That's what,  I would think.
B:	But I,  I don't know for sure.
B:	I just know that, um, acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from, would
B:	comes over the border from us.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the automobile definitely is an area and any, any industry that burns, you know,
A:	and then I don't know about chemical pollution.
A:	I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air.
A:	I know we have a lot of chemical, the indoor type pollution.
A:	They have offices that are too well insulated.
A:	They found people are getting sick,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I don't know if that affects outside.
A:	You know, I, I think, seems to think, seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside
A:	and the thing I can, the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, um, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which,  has been a real problem.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it?
B:	Again I, that's what I hear
B:	and, and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not
B:	but at last I heard it was, uh, discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought,  initially.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's
A:	It's kind of scary.
B:	Well, it is scary
B:	and I think it will, uh, continue to force us to clean up our act,  literally and figuratively.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment.
A:	I think something too that you probably see in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces.
B:	I, I, I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't,  do that.
A:	I think it will.
B:	In Los Angeles they're apparently going to,
B:	they've passed laws that, for habit, do you think this could possibly be prohibit? nothing elseseems to make any sense?? for example, people using, uh, barbecues *listen for habit prohibit gasoline lawn mowers, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles,
B:	and, it's gotten bad in Denver
A:	Right.
B:	and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.
B:	And people in this country are really wedded to their, uh, cars,
A:	Right.
B:	and our economy seems to,
B:	and this I think is one of the big problems,
A:	Yeah.
A:	In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out,
B:	Yeah.
A:	we have to drive so far,
A:	but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts,
A:	but we're even getting it here.
A:	We can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas
A:	and you can tell it in the mornings too.
A:	My husband likes to go out and jog
A:	and there's just a brown fog here
A:	and we don't even have any mountains that are,  holding it in.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together, the worse it gets.
B:	Well that makes a lot of sense.
B:	I mean I, I hadn't thought about it that way
B:	but it, it,
A:	You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, they make, uh, making more and more high-rise buildings
A:	and, uh, so yeah,
A:	we can comment
A:	and we didn't see this a few years ago.
B:	No,
B:	and I think,
A:	It was pretty clear here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I think that, that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts,  and that there is a, a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it, it's going to tell us about it,
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, we're going to feel it,
B:	and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy,  uh, in this country, uh, whether people are willing to get out of their cars,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable.
B:	For example,  taxing people heavily for using their cars.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using
B:	and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive
B:	but I think, uh, we're going to have to make some fundamental changes
B:	and, and I'm, I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and,  houses we sell.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car, just one person in that.
A:	It's a lot of waste
A:	but,
A:	Okay, Eric.
A:	Uh, are you married
A:	and do you have a family?
B:	Uh, yes I am to, uh, both questions.
A:	Okay
A:	and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances.
B:	Uh, yeah
B:	we do.
B:	We, uh, uh,
B:	basically there's the, you know, the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every, every month
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we, uh, enter those into, uh, into a spread sheet
B:	and, uh, whatever is left, uh, after that we, you know, we sit down and agree on kind of what, what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see. Uh
B:	So what do you do?
A:	Well, that's basically what we do.
A:	Uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget
A:	and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks.
A:	I work part time at night
B:	Wow
A:	and he works, and my husband works full times days
A:	and so we have four checks,
A:	but that works out nice because we get paid every week
A:	and  so that does help,
B:	Yeah.
A:	that helps a lot.
A:	And then, uh, we don't have a lot extra for extra spending,
A:	so it's pretty well ear marked.
B:	Yeah.
B:	All allocated out.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Every penny is ear marked
A:	but, uh it, we have found that works the best
A:	and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up.
A:	In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half,
A:	but and divide those up between all,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	All the checks,
B:	yeah.
A:	And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one
A:	and then the next pay check we're real short
A:	or,
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses.
A:	That's true.
B:	We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know,
B:	we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand.
B:	We thought it uh, thought it to be really helpful.
B:	We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,
A:	Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes
B:	Yeah
A:	and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget,
A:	but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in
A:	and then you're saying, my word where did all that money  go.
B:	That's a lot of money,
B:	but
A:	Where does it go?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh
B:	But,
A:	and also we have found that if we write down,
A:	and we did this.
A:	We are not real consistent with this,
A:	but we did it for about a month
A:	and we wrote down everything that we bought when, you know, every pay check
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we could see where every penny went
A:	and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend
A:	and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it.
A:	It's,
A:	we should cause it does help.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit
A:	Uh-huh
B:	it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say, oh, it's gone
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	just stick to that,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	That is,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That that sounds like a really good idea.
B:	So.
A:	And it really helpful.
A:	Uh, have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet?
B:	We, we haven't.
B:	We our our initial goal was just to retire debt, uh, completely retire debt for car payments and credit card uh, credit card debt and all of that.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We are just at a point where, where we could start thinking about it
B:	so
A:	Oh that's good.
A:	That's a good feeling
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well I
A:	My husband just graduated from the university, uh, a year ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so finally finally we are getting to that point too.
B:	A student.
A:	So, are you still going to school
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am actually in the, in the
A:	Kay.
B:	Okay.
A:	I guess we're talking about exercise, huh?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well first of all I, I have to ask you how, how old you are?
A:	Oh, I am twenty-seven.
B:	Twenty-seven,
B:	okay.
B:	Well, I am quite a bit older than you are
B:	But, no.
B:	I think exercise is extremely important
B:	and I I do exercise on a regular basis.
A:	You do?
A:	What type of exercise do you do?
B:	Well, I do, uh, jazzercise which is an aerobic, uh, program that,
A:	Oh you do.
B:	are you familiar with it?
A:	Yes.
B:	It's, uh, you know, a national company
B:	and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long
B:	so you can,
A:	Are they different from aerobics
A:	or is it the same thing?
B:	No
B:	it's really, it's an aerobic routine.
B:	you warm up
B:	and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, you know, slowly and then working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate
B:	and then you gradually go down again.
A:	And you do that every day
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	I only do it probably two or three times a week.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.
A:	And this is a club
A:	or, uh, do you belong to a group?
B:	Well, it's really a
B:	I mean it's called a center
B:	and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time
B:	and then you just go in whenever you can.
B:	So, like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.
A:	Do you go with friends
A:	or do you go alone?
B:	No,
B:	I go by myself
B:	and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me
A:	Yeah.
B:	and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise
B:	or they might play tennis
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and since I am not a tennis player, uh, you know, I don't get that,
B:	but I am, you know, I am between, I am in my late forties
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh, there aren't many people, you know, that want to do that.
A:	Oh
B:	Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. You know, with with children between the ages,
A:	Oh yeah
A:	young mothers or,
B:	Young mothers.
B:	You know, young women, with small children are the ones that I find.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, what do you do?
A:	Uh, I really don't have a routine.
A:	I like playing basketball.
A:	We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
A:	and that's what I do every day.
B:	Oh, great.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you play every day?
A:	Yeah,
A:	pretty much.
A:	When my wife lets me.
B:	Well, now who do you play with?
B:	Do you have friends that play with you
B:	or just,
A:	No,
A:	I just shoot around by myself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, that's about it.
A:	I use to play soccer a lot in high school,
A:	but when I graduated I haven't done much.
A:	I don't have a problem.
A:	I know I have to do more aerobics,
A:	but I don't have a problem with weight.
A:	I could eat all day and not gain an ounce
B:	Well see, that's, that's really good
B:	and I think that keeps a lot, some people from exercising.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either,
B:	but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise.  You know
A:	You do exercise.
B:	I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin
B:	and it's because I exercise
A:	You do it
B:	but I also watch what I eat. You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you'll come,
B:	being twenty-seven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet
A:	Yeah
A:	and I
B:	but as you get older you will.
A:	well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days,
A:	but I don't know
B:	Well, it might not
B:	Mine,
B:	because everybody's been telling me that too
B:	and so far it hasn't happened, you know,
B:	and I, I just feel like, you know, you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know, too high.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess I enjoy sports a lot
A:	so that's why I've kept active in that way.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But you don't play any other sports but basketball?
A:	Uh, basketball,
A:	volleyball, uh,
A:	too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby,
A:	I do that.
B:	But, do you ski?
B:	Being in Utah, I was wondering if you ski.
A:	Uh, I use to,
A:	but it got too expensive,
A:	so.
B:	Oh did it really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Cause I know that skiing in Utah is, is suppose to be great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot of people do that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and but, well I just I never find the time.
A:	I had rather do other things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I have never skied before,
B:	but I have friends that go to Utah all the time
B:	and they think it's really
A:	Oh they come up here.
B:	and they ski.
B:	I guess there's a place where you can ski,
B:	well is it Tahoe? Where you ski from,
B:	no
B:	that's Nevada to California  I guess.
A:	That's in Nevada.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line.
A:	Oh, yeah
A:	but,
B:	But there's a there is a place in Utah called a funny name.
A:	There's Snow Bird or Alta.
B:	But it's like, Oh, Heavenly.
B:	Is that it?
A:	Heavenly?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it's called Heavenly.
A:	Huh. I've never heard of that one.
B:	You've never heard of that?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Well, maybe it isn't in Utah.
B:	But they said they've skied Heavenly
B:	and it sounded like, you know, that they skied really well, and when they are actually talking about a place.
B:	It's kind of funny.
A:	Do they exercise much or, I mean for skiing?
A:	I know when I went, you can get sore easily
A:	but,
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	You can get really sore.
B:	I know you,
B:	I mean I've talked to people,
B:	but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	is one or two timer a year if I do go on them
A:	and I am really sore after.
B:	And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst?
A:	Yeah.
B:	In your legs and,
A:	My legs really, really ache.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, that's,
A:	I am using muscles that I have never used before.
B:	Well,
B:	and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, you know, all the time
B:	and then I went horseback riding
B:	and still I was so sore
B:	and I couldn't get over,
A:	Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.
B:	Uh, I certainly can't argue with that.
B:	Definitely does need some improvements. Uh,
B:	and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think there's a limit on that.
A:	The, uh, the, uh peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many,
B:	I think it's, Four or five,
A:	but you can,
B:	I can't remember which.
B:	I was on a jury trial last year
B:	only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got.
A:	Um. Yeah,
A:	it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things.
A:	I think I have a severe demeanor or something.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh,
B:	That, uh,
A:	But, typically, you know, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process
A:	and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.
B:	Right,
B:	but it still has to be a group of your peers.
A:	Right.
B:	See.
A:	So,
B:	So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,
A:	So if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have nincompoops to, uh,
B:	You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.
A:	Um.
B:	So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat,
B:	but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.
A:	Um.
B:	I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have.
B:	you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,
B:	but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.
A:	Um.
B:	Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.  Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.
A:	Well, I suppose you may be right on that.
A:	Matter of fact, I've heard that,  I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,
B:	Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime.
B:	But when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side,
B:	and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.
A:	Oh, is it?
A:	Oh, I didn't realize that.
A:	Okay.
B:	At least in California, they're supposed to be.
B:	Not during the trial,
B:	during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background.
A:	Right.
B:	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial.
B:	They get too boring.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.
B:	Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.
A:	Um.
B:	So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better.
B:	When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant,
B:	you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.
A:	What about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.
B:	I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like what?
B:	Well, uh, say, embezzlement, right.
B:	You get a guy down the street who comes up, uh, carrying a
A:	Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. I, you know, I, I really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated body of law.
A:	And if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently were  they judged by today's standards.
A:	So I, I really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it.
A:	What do you think?
B:	Uh, I, I don't think so.
B:	Possibly in the jury selection would be the only,
B:	just for example, what we're seeing in California I guess.
B:	It makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome.
A:	Well won't,
A:	well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
A:	but then then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, the  other two guys sat in the car
B:	That's, that's bad .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they didn't get beat up. You know.
B:	No.
B:	It ,
A:	Rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting is self-destruct.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Everybody  says well this is the nineties
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	and they're going to rebuild
A:	and it'll be even better.
A:	Hey, what do you think,
A:	you know, some, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?
B:	That's right.
A:	With everybody with that mind set. They, they're  they're going to, that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto, you know,
B:	They're only going to suffer.
A:	and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.
B:	they're only going to suffer.
B:	They, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence.
B:	Uh, I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape
B:	and, uh,
A:	Well everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
A:	and we're going to reexamine this thing.
A:	Hey, the the average person is going to take a look at that and say, suspicions confirmed.
A:	They're a bunch of animals, you know.
A:	How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything.
A:	Forty deaths.
A:	I mean there are forty people  that are dead as a result of that.
B:	I know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really ridiculous.
A:	And I'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh, you know, Rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths.
B:	Against forty other people being,
A:	Yeah.
A:	And there's no other,
A:	I'm not exactly sure, uh, what the circumstances surrounding the deaths.
A:	And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and, and pursued it, you know, because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing.
B:	Those deaths.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner?
A:	I, you know,
A:	no tears.
B:	Or just a an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And  and so I, but I, I suspect a number of them.
B:	Um.
A:	You know, you, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street.
B:	Or, or beaten.
A:	And, and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before, rather than stop.
A:	And, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage after, after, after if I'd been at the wheel.
B:	Um very
A:	No one  would have stopped me.
B:	Right.
B:	That's, that's exactly how I feel too.
B:	I wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't have stopped my car for any, anything had I seen them coming.
B:	But I was just wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer to the, the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here.
A:	Right.
A:	I'm inside the beltway.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they think thus
A:	and so and I say well wait a minute,
A:	I'm inside the beltway
A:	and I don't think like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm a government employee.
B:	Oh.
B:	In what, uh, section of the government do you work?
A:	I'm with the F B I.
B:	Oh
B:	Oh, that's interesting
A:	Yes.
A:	and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick, whose another government employee wanted a segments of my speech, that that were done a year ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he wanted another collection a year later.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so this is my seventh call.
A:	A year ago I did eleven calls.
B:	Oh, I see
A:	And so that's, that's why, uh, uh, that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique, you know, I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate,
A:	Uh, around here we have a program where, uh, we, we put out the, the, we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers.
A:	And we keep the newspapers in a, in a,
A:	they're collected twice a month and the trash and, and this bottled stuff that is put in a, in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck.
A:	So they actually have about three passes at this collection. One for  the regular trash, one for the, uh, uh, you know, the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers.
B:	Sounds,
B:	But I gather you do not separate, uh, the bottles and cans.
A:	No,
A:	they, they do that on the truck.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They separate them as they, as they, you know, dump them.
A:	And, you know, one guy comes around with his truck and, and dumps it all in there.
A:	And I think they're, they're running out of, uh, you know, .
A:	The sanitary landfill, I think, uh, is, you know, running out.
A:	Of course, uh, you being from New Mexico, you've probably been to Washington. Especially if you're, your present location.
B:	Yes.
A:	You must have come to Washington at least once.
B:	Yes,
B:	I know.
B:	Not only have I come to Washington but, uh, I find it very amusing that, uh, the thing that was just instituted here is very similar.
B:	That is we also have blue bins.
B:	We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and, uh, landfill space is, in deed, the driving factor here.
B:	And, in fact, uh, despite all of our open space out here, landfill space is still, uh, very hard to come by.
A:	My, you've got a lot a, a lot of nothing out there. You know,
A:	they got,
A:	I mean there, there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could, you could use for landfill.
B:	Ah,
B:	but if somebody can make a regulation about it, they will.
A:	Well what other, what, uh, what unique things you think, uh, that you can do about it in, in what, in Los Alamos?
B:	Well, uh,
B:	Yes,
B:	other than nuking it.
B:	Um, in fact, Los Alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general.
B:	Um, it, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. And, uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements.
A:	Well, isn't that a, that's a, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation.
A:	I don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting  rid of the heavy metals.
B:	And  the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody has, uh, made some special, uh, polymers that have the ability to, uh, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.
B:	Uh, uh, they've, uh, looked at, uh, plutonium and uranium and, uh, some other similar things to  try to remove those from radio active waste
A:	Huh.
B:	and, again, this is driven by all of the documentation and, uh, E S and H, uh, uh, considerations that, uh, people are, uh, worrying about, I think, much more than they should.
B:	Actually  I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable.
B:	Back when I was in graduate school, I did all of the recycling of the, uh, paper from the computer center
B:	and, uh, in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable recycled paper.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well that's certainly, uh, you know, uh, getting into the swim of things.
A:	I, I think it should be, it should go to the, to the heart of the matter though and say, okay guy,
A:	you, everybody gets, you know, five pounds of garbage that they can throw away, you know.
A:	Uh, but more than that every week, uh, you've got to pay by the pound.
A:	I, I think  I think people would be, would get very, very, you know, they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff.
B:	I think that's a wonderful idea.
B:	The only alternative I would see is, uh, and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. Uh, if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would, uh, speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it would  also cause people to compact their garbage more.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and, uh, and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight.
A:	Well, of course, that, uh, you know, those big trucks can, can, probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.
A:	Well my exercise program consists of, uh, you know,
A:	it's, it's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of, you know, wasting my, my, the, you know, the, trying to exist on the latency of my youth, the good health of my youth.
B:	Huh.
A:	I'm,
A:	and what I like to do is I like to stretch out
A:	and I like to run, uh,
A:	I'm, I like to run, get my heartbeat up.
A:	I like to run about, oh, about two, two and a half miles.
A:	And then I like to work out on, uh, on the, uh, the Bailey Life Cycle machines up here at the, at the Holiday Spa.
A:	And, and I, I think that, you know,
A:	I've had a regiment now for about, you know, ten, fifteen years of, of doing that
A:	and, uh, and I, I kind of think it's, uh, it's a lot of work
A:	but I think it's, uh, it's a lot of work
A:	but I think it's, uh, it's the, uh, the amount of effort that's required to, uh, to stay healthy, you know.
A:	I have a sedentary job
A:	and, uh, unless you do something like that, you're going to get sick.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm, I need to get,
B:	I'm, I'm pretty bad about that.
B:	I'm lazy.
B:	I should, I know
B:	I want, I always say that I need to get start running
B:	and I'm going to try and do that this summer.
B:	Because I never have time.
B:	I, I always put it off.
B:	By the time I get back from classes it's late at night
B:	and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever.
B:	Because I'm, I'm getting a gut here.
B:	I got to get back into shape.
A:	Well, I, uh, two years ago I started having trouble with my knee.
A:	And, uh, you know, I've got, you know,
A:	I figured well, it'll go away.
A:	Well I you know, I'm, I've had to reduce my program, reduce my program
A:	and I've gained fifteen pounds.
B:	Huh.
A:	And so, uh, you know, it's, you know,
A:	I need to get back into swimming, you know, instead of running.
A:	If I can't swim or I can't run, I should be able to swim.
A:	Well I'm such a terrible swimmer
A:	and I, I, I really feel I can, I can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort.
A:	But if it gets longer than that I, I, it, I start not doing anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so, so I got a real problem in that regard.
A:	Uh, it,
A:	do,
A:	you obviously are, are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I do it, I guess,
B:	I'm going to do it, uh, because I want to get in shape.
B:	I'm not, it's not something I really enjoy all that much that, I'll, I'll probably,
B:	I mean once I get into it and I, if I, if I get into better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me.
A:	Well, it's, it's always a chore.
A:	I mean  I started doing this when I was about thirty-five
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	and now I'm fifty-five.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, you know, I, I know that in, I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some, some piece of nonsense.
A:	you know, some health related thing is going to blow me away.
A:	That's the same way,
A:	I got too much weight on right now.
A:	I  need to lose fifty pounds, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	I need to lose at least twenty, you know.
A:	But, uh, you know, it's, it's just, uh, I'm busy.
A:	I'm doing a lot of traveling
A:	and, uh, it, it creates a problem, uh, you know, when you're on the road.
A:	What sort of, uh, uh, what other programs other than say running?
A:	Have you, have you ever done anything at all?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have.
B:	Uh, sit-ups
B:	or, also last summer I was doing Nautilus
B:	or last year I'm, uh, belong to a club right here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was a little bit too much money.
B:	But, uh, doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that.
A:	club, what club are you with?
B:	I'm sorry?
A:	What club were you with?
B:	It's called, oh, what was it called City Sports, downtown Washington.
A:	Oh. Okay.
A:	So you're, you're down, you're downtown.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm at, I'm at, I go to George Washington University.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You're down there on, you know, twentieth and eighteenth and  F G.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's , uh, Plaza.
A:	Oh.
A:	Well, I'd, uh,
A:	well there's a, there's a Holiday Spa down there on, on K street, I think. Something like that.
A:	But, uh, I, I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria
A:	and that's pretty good.
A:	But, you know, evening time it gets pretty busy.
A:	But generally, you know, I can, I can get in and get a program, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, you know, I, I need to, I need to rededicate myself to, uh, to doing this
A:	and, uh, I got a problem, uh, you know, ever since my knee went bad, of getting back solidly into it.
A:	I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen, twenty years.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, you know, and I'm, I know I'm going to get, I know it's going to bite me in the ass
A:	and so I, I really don't want to, want to, uh, you know, back off on it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's something,
B:	I think, uh, I'm young,
B:	I should get started getting into shape.
B:	I don't want to,
B:	I want,
B:	I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it. .
A:	Well, no.
A:	When you're young, you, you can abuse your, your, all your systems
A:	and you can recover.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems, you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye, you know.
B:	Huh
A:	And, uh, and so the object,
A:	Okay.
B:	The topic is to discuss the, uh, sources where I receive news.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio,
B:	I almost never watch television, as a matter of course
B:	so, I don't get news from television,
B:	except during the war, I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, why was C N N the only,
A:	of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it,
A:	is that not true?
B:	Um.
A:	It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news coverage.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I don't know.
B:	I guess, uh, I don't even know why I watched C N N.
B:	I guess, I just wanted more news.
B:	It's one of the few times I wanted more news than.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I know even if you watched A B C, N B C or the other,
A:	I mean, what's the other one, uh, C B S.
B:	C B S.
A:	They all were, were tapped into C N N.
B:	Were they?
A:	Uh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's the only thing they broadcast
A:	and like you I listened to radio on my job at work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about that is why, uh, why C N N was
A:	well, I listen to a Christian radio station.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world, uh, news service
A:	and, uh, they,
A:	it was,
A:	you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got, you know.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church went to Israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was watching on TV
A:	they, they broadcast this terrible riot
A:	supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem,
B:	Right.
A:	and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know, uh, if the news we're getting is any good.
A:	So
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably, don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	But, uh, I, I'm from California
B:	and I can remember being in, uh, in these earthquakes
B:	and, I mean they were, they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it seemed, you know, from anyone else's point of view,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but they get all blown up in the news. Um,
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Well I, I find it depressing to watch our,
A:	specially TV, you know,
A:	it's just, uh,
A:	local news concentrates, on murders and things like that.
A:	I'm from Dallas
A:	and, uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, uh,
A:	it just really gets me depressed, even to watch it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So then, you wake up one morning
A:	and you are in war with somebody
A:	you don't even, even know about it.
B:	Right.
A:	So.
B:	Well, what newspapers, uh, do you read in Dallas?
A:	Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS,
A:	but I don't, I don't read newspapers
B:	Don't you?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	How come?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I find it hard to, uh, follow from one page to another.
A:	It's just something I have never developed, uh, an interest in.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it
B:	Gosh that's, that sounds pretty bad to me.
B:	I mean who would steal a newspaper?
A:	You would be surprised.
B:	Huh?
A:	They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV, you know uh, selections of the day.
B:	I see.
A:	I don't know.
A:	It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	who would steal a newspaper?
A:	in glass sound in But, they do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What part of California are you from?
B:	Uh, from Los Angeles,
B:	but I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, right now,
B:	that's where I am speaking to you from.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	But, I grew up in L A.
B:	I work out here.
A:	Huh, you work for T I?
B:	No,
B:	I don't.
B:	I work for North Carolina State University.
A:	Huh.
B:	But, uh, I know some people at T I,
B:	and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I'm in the computer business.
A:	Well, I,
A:	boy, current events is not a good subject for me.
B:	Well.
A:	I don't keep up with it that often.
B:	Let's see, I've, I've, I've never done this before,
B:	I mean I've never.
A:	This is your first call?
B:	This is my first call. Because I just got my password.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I don't know,
B:	are we suppose to,
B:	it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes,
B:	but I think we've been talking for three minutes
B:	and nobody has interrupted.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I, I got into a conversation last night with a lady
A:	and they interrupt at ten, minutes.
B:	I see.
A:	So if we've done our three minutes. Let's just let the conversation end and say bye.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, all right.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Nice talking to you too.
B:	All right,
B:	bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	You want to start?
B:	Well, I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged
B:	and therefore, having seen the last generation, I guess it puts me in, you know, gives me a perspective on that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I, am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women in, both in society and in the work place,
B:	uh, there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office, but not necessarily.
B:	Uh, now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples, uh, are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will, uh, have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed.
A:	I agree, uh,
A:	the equality of, uh, the roles now between the sexes, I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war, especially compared with, uh, the Vietnam war
A:	and you see women going off to wars as well as men.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I have wondered why they allowed, or let, you know, both the father and mother go, uh,
A:	and the children are left without either parent.
A:	Now to me that's kind of a drawback.
A:	But, uh, I guess it's a price you pay.
A:	And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the, uh, uh, day care centers.
B:	Wonder about them in what way?
A:	Well, uh, from what I understand there's been studies that, uh, these children are, uh, more rebellious.
A:	Uh, they term it as more, uh, creative. But, uh, that they, uh, are much more contentious.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I, I don't, I, I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up, you know, in a, uh, kind of a, uh, community, rather than a home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have not, to be honest, had much experience, with children in that situation.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I guess one knows one's own storly
B:	and I know, uh, in my children's case it was one where, uh, pretty much up until the older of two was in, uh, let's see, I guess basically starting junior high
B:	and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh
A:	So they,
B:	so I guess my experience is, is just with what we did
B:	and, and so they didn't really go through the child care route.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They were able to be home together.
B:	Uh, and we never actually experienced that.
B:	What, in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the, the next generation or so, I guess I anticipate, uh, an increasing equality, uh, greater presence of women in management roles
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of, of surrogacy that we see.
B:	I just don't know.
A:	What do you mean?
B:	Uh, deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Sort of rent-a-mom,
B:	to be, you know, not to be crass about it, but, uh, uh, whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, uh, uh a professional mother, person. For instance, that,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's strange.
A:	A nanny, sort of?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I could, you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.
B:	In fact, I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
B:	Uh, I, I don't have a, other than, than a reading and, and male perspective on, on the on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not.
B:	Uh, I know that, that my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent.
B:	I, I don't know that I, uh, felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't have boys,
B:	that doesn't, didn't bother me,
B:	never has.
B:	Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or, or as a professional nanny, nanny as you put it, uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	It would be a sort of day care,
B:	but it would be more of a family setting.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I know that there are young people, characterized, I guess as being half my age, so that by definition that means, they're young. Uh, that, in my work place, who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman, uh, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	To come in and live with them?
B:	I could easily envision that.
B:	Pardon?
A:	To come in and live with them?
B:	Or to put their child into a into a home setting, where they would, you know, like they, they would get, leave at eight in the morning and, and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and you were paying for really high quality care.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on, on the order of what I quoted to someone, because that's what the experience they want
B:	and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that, that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then you might have more control over, uh, the, the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I know the day care centers are not cheap either.
A:	You know they're,
B:	I haven't ever really looked at them.
B:	Are you aware at all, of, of what they would, what they cost?
A:	Uh, well, no,
A:	I just know, I know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it.
A:	They have to go with the, a single, uh, I mean a baby-sitter more, more or less.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think it's like, about sixty dollars a week for two children if I'm not mistaken.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you have to pay that whether you're on vacation, you know, and taking care of the children or if the children are at home, at home, sick.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, that is, you know, just a, a rate that you have to pay
A:	and, uh,
B:	What, what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society?
A:	Uh, I think, I really don't have a vision
B:	That's okay, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I think that they will be more in the work place because, uh, the door's open.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it's just human nature to walk through an open door.
A:	So, and I would be glad to see that.
A:	I hope I don't see a lot more single moms,
A:	but, it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the time.
B:	.
B:	I'm, I'm noticing that, too,
B:	and, and I notice the, the, a terming emerging called solo parents, that I'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that, that I encounter in the work place,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that, that is a little troublesome. Uh, because the pressures on them are, are, rather, rather formidable.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	It's awful.
A:	Yeah
B:	Uh, and maybe that's a change we'll see.
B:	Maybe, uh, the possibility of, of women, uh, who deliberately say, no,
B:	we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps, in the event of a separation or whatever.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Well, I think we've done it
B:	Well, I think we're about done.
B:	Okay.
A:	Thank you very much.
B:	Uh, good-bye.
A:	It's been interesting.
B:	You take care.
A:	Okay.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	So are you a freshwater or,
A:	Mostly freshwater,
A:	I
B:	Freshwater,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, I used to fish, uh, when I was real young, down in Galveston with my parents,
A:	and I never really got into that too much, because you have to get in the boat really to do anything,
A:	and I didn't know anybody who had a boat now,
A:	so I don't fish too much in saltwater.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater. Uh, mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish
A:	Oh, really,
A:	Oh, neat,
B:	and, uh, I have caught one or two small sharks
A:	Oh, really.
B:	and, uh, yes.
A:	What'd you do with them?
B:	Put them back
A:	You didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do?
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	I love shark steak,
B:	but, uh, the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything.
A:	Do they have a limit on sharks,
A:	I mean, is that like a, a sport fish,
A:	can you actually catch those
A:	and there's no limit.
B:	Is there a limit?
B:	I have no idea.
B:	I know, I,
B:	my home is in, uh, Pensacola, Florida
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, it's, they do a lot of shark fishing in that, you know, in the gulf
A:	Right.
B:	and, um, there's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from, I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have, uh, shark tournaments,
B:	and, you know, there's part,
B:	either as part of or separate from the, uh, bill fishing tournaments they usually have so, I have not done, uh, much freshwater fishing oh, for, you know, lake, lake fishing for bass and so forth but, uh, maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things, but nothing,
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think I've been trout fishing once.
B:	I've never fly fished.
B:	Have you fly fished?
A:	Uh, no
A:	I haven't.
A:	I don't know that I could do that.
A:	That looks awful tiring
B:	I've tried it once,
A:	Did you.
B:	yes,
B:	uh, a friend of mine
A:	Didn't like it?
B:	no.
B:	I could never get the hang of it.
A:	It looks complicated to me.
A:	It's a rhythm or something
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I usually ended snagging my, uh, fishing partners or the trees along the bank
A:	Catching tree bass,
A:	right
B:	Yes
B:	Almost got an owl once.
A:	Did you
A:	That would have been something.
B:	But, uh.
A:	So do you, do you fish mainly for trophies
A:	or do you, do you eat what you fish.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no.
B:	I used, uh, when I was, uh, working in Florida, I used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	you know, there are people who fish,
B:	and then there are people who catch.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, I'm a fisher
A:	You just like to sit down and watch it, right.
B:	That's right,
B:	I've never caught that much,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Really.
B:	Oh, and occasionally we'd go out on a, you know, full day trip, you know, three or four other people and do either, again, bottom fishing or or for grouper
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	or, I used to catch you know, I've caught a few worthwhile snappers, red snappers and gray snappers and so forth.
A:	That's nice.
B:	What about you, you a,
A:	Well, most of my fishing is done at, um, area lakes around here, freshwater lakes
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, most of it,
A:	I haven't been really in a long time.
A:	Last time I went I actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish
A:	and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle.
A:	That was real fun.
A:	Um, but, um, I went fishing at, I don't know if you've ever heard of, uh, Lake Worth.
A:	It's a fairly new lake in Texas.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And, uh, we went fishing there last memorial day, *Memorial Day
A:	and I caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep.
A:	I was so excited.
A:	And, uh, that's really about it.
A:	Mostly just the lakes around here,
A:	and I fish to take home and cook
A:	I don't, I don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching.
A:	I get a little bit of relaxation from it,
A:	but mainly I, um, I want to say I brought something home.
A:	I want to say I did this,
A:	I was out there for a reason
B:	The last time I went, uh, bass fishing,
B:	I was with my daughter, a friend of hers, and, well, a friend of mine and his daughter.
B:	We, I was the only one who did not catch, a single fish
A:	Really.
B:	my daughter caught fish,
B:	his daughter caught fish,
B:	he caught fish.
A:	Everybody but you.
B:	I did not even, I did not even,
B:	I have been, I was out on a party boat a few years ago,
B:	and we, we were grouper fishing,
B:	or, you know, actually we were, uh, snapper fishing.
B:	Everyone on the boat was catching snapper, snappers except guess who.
A:	It had to be you.
B:	I I,
A:	Couldn't catch one to save your life. Huh.
B:	That's right,
B:	I would go from one side of the boat to the other,
B:	and, uh, the, uh, the party boat captain could not understand, you know,
B:	he even, even he started baiting my hook and holding, holding the, uh, the fishing rod.
A:	How funny,
A:	just hoping maybe, he could pull
B:	Right,
B:	and it was, it was really, really, really bad.
B:	Uh, I, as I said, I am a fisher,
B:	I'm not a catcher.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, I enjoy it though.
B:	I don't really get out as much as I, uh, as I would like too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they do, of course, you know,
B:	here in,
B:	we're only just a few, not a few minutes, we're, you know, forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland
A:	Right.
B:	and they do a lot of fishing there.
B:	Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays, or uh, or for oysters.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	That would be fun.
B:	And, uh, that I was able to do, when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom.
A:	Right
A:	Hand picked
B:	That right
A:	The weirdest fishing experience I ever had. People to this day are still trying to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught.
A:	We were in, uh, Rockport, which is close to Corpus
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we had been fishing in a canal,
A:	they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,
A:	and, uh, we'd been fishing in the canals
A:	and all we were catching were catfish,
A:	and we were pretty bored with that.
A:	So, we thought well, maybe there are some crab in here,
A:	we'll try to catch some crab.
A:	So I got my chicken and all my little net and everything,
A:	and something,
A:	I had a rock to weight it down,
A:	something grabs and just runs with it.
A:	And of course there's no hook,
A:	so it can't be a fish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm sure it's not a fish,
A:	right.
A:	And crab, they don't bite like that,
A:	they don't just run with your food.
A:	So, I netted it,
A:	and it was the ugliest fish I've ever seen in my life.
A:	It had real teeth, like human teeth,
A:	and it looked archaic.
A:	I, I had no idea what it was.
A:	I called my father long distance just to describe the thing,
A:	and it had the rock in its mouth, not the chicken,
A:	but the rock itself is what it had grabbed.
B:	Um.
A:	They say it's a dog fish, from everything I've described,
A:	it was brown with these little white dots
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it made a loud, almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it, it was the strangest thing.
A:	Oh, I'll never get over that.
A:	To this day I don't want to get in the water, anywhere around salt water because I'm sure one of those fish are there.
B:	Well, we used to,
B:	I guess the weirdest thing I've ever caught is, uh, in some of the inlets and the rivers around Delaware.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They have a fish that's called an oyster cracker.
B:	I don't know if you've ever heard of it
A:	I've never heard of that one.
B:	and it has a huge strong mouth,
B:	and they actually, uh, use their teeth to open oysters.
A:	That's where it gets its name, obviously, huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and this is the ugliest, fish I have ever seen,
B:	and I mean, and they come in all you know,
B:	I've, I've caught them from, you know, three or four inches long up to, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long,
B:	but just huge, ugly things just terrible.
A:	Huh.
A:	Can you eat them?
B:	No,
B:	no.
A:	Ooh.
A:	I, I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly,
A:	but.
B:	They just, they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them.
A:	That's like this dog fish,
A:	it was, it scared me to death.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was it really, it didn't look like, it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died.
B:	Well, the first time I went surf fishing was in ,
B:	and I threw my line out
B:	and the first thing I caught was a sand shark, which was probably a foot, and a half or, uh, two feet long,
B:	and scared me to death.
A:	Oh.
B:	I had never seen anything,
B:	and then I was fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes, caught a few white fish and so forth,
B:	and then I felt something relatively heavy,
B:	and I thought, oh, really, here, I'm really going to get one.
B:	And I,
A:	Okay, um,
A:	let's see.
A:	How do you feel about credit cards?
B:	Personally, I do not care for them. Uh, although I find them a necessity in business and so forth,
B:	I, I try to refrain from their use as much as possible. Um, for a number of reasons, one of which is the, you know, extreme interest rate on most of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The one I use, uh, of course, for mostly, only for business purposes is, uh, you know, American Express.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, I'm not I'm not terribly in favor of them.
B:	Not for my own personal, uh, point of view.
A:	Right.
B:	Plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion, I believe
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Wow.
B:	uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have, I have heard.
A:	Right.
B:	Do you use them frequently
B:	or,
A:	Well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have, and we can put it in our budget, yeah, we'll, we'll use it.
A:	But like last year, I think we paid,
A:	I think it was like twenty something cents interest, on our Visa.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think this, this year we, uh, I think we used it for Christmas,
A:	and we got caught just a few days on our grace period.
A:	And, uh, so we'll pay a little interest this year, but maybe two dollars.
A:	But we don't like to do that at all.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, you know, we, I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly.
A:	We, uh, we have several credit cards, though.
A:	We have a gas card, our Visa, and then, of course, the American Express,
A:	and I think we have a couple of department stores.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, we use it the same way,
A:	and, uh,
B:	I find the one I use mostly, uh,
B:	aside from the American Express, I do use my Sears card.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I try, as with the American Express, I try to pay it, you know, as it comes in.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So, uh,
A:	It's, it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill.
A:	That's usually how we do it.
B:	I know when I travel, or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit, what I would do on my American Express card is before I would, before I left I would mail a check to, to American Express and, you know, have some idea of how much was there, you know, I'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever I felt I would spend. And then use it then.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.
B:	But, uh, but I knew that it was paid
B:	I knew I knew that I had that much credit, going in.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Sometimes, you know, sometimes I would go over,
B:	but it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big, in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	That's good.
A:	I've, I don't think we've gone that far to pay it in you know, in advance before we spend it,
A:	but, I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, that, like that, that may be good.
B:	Well, I found I found in, um, in traveling overseas that, uh, often it would, uh, it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card for hotel bills and so forth.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Plus I would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, for example, I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip, I think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And when I finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.
B:	So the
A:	Wow
B:	So, I got caught a little short in that regard,
A:	Wow.
B:	but, uh uh, I, I was anticipating, you know, my room would cost, uh, let's say
A:	Yeah.
B:	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty
A:	Right.
B:	maybe it would be more than that.
B:	It was more than.
B:	It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	of course the government was several months behind in, their, on its per diem for exchange rate.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	So there's a little consternation, you know, in trying to get them to compensate, for the difference in the exchange rate.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah
A:	especially,
B:	That was the only time I really got caught short.
B:	And I, But as I said, most, most of all I try not to use them, uh, to any, you know, lavishly, in that regard.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's good.
B:	Well, from where are you calling?
A:	Oh, from the Dallas area.
B:	So you're from
B:	okay,
B:	I'm from Maryland.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah
A:	Wow.
A:	Do you work for T I?
B:	No.
B:	I work for G T E.
A:	Well, really.
B:	Yes.
A:	Um. I wonder how T I got G T E involved.
B:	Well, I know Jack Godfrey.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I know him very well.
B:	I've known Jack for a long time,
B:	and I'm also in the speech business.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, when I heard that Jack was going to do this, I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, so that's how I got involved.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You have a very, um, very,
A:	what's the word.
A:	Your, your speech is very exact.
B:	Oh. Thank you very much
B:	But, as Jack said, I'm one of the, the old hands in the speech business.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh. Yes,
B:	I, I've been doing it for twenty some odd years.
A:	Wow.
B:	And so, uh, I was very much interested, uh, in getting involved in, uh, switchboard.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, you work for T I?
A:	Right.
A:	I work in .
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording
A:	Yeah
A:	I think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject,
A:	so, I think you get ten,
A:	so I think we're okay.
B:	Alright.
B:	Okay,
B:	fine.
B:	Well, you have a good evening.
A:	Well, you too.
B:	It's been pleasant talking to you.
A:	Same here.
B:	Take care.
B:	Good night.
A:	Bye.
A:	Well, what would you have at a dinner party?
B:	Well, uh, lately, since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time
B:	uh, I have one recipe for, uh, a really good, um, type of a meatball.
B:	It's called burgundy meatball
B:	and it's made with red wine and,
A:	Oh, gosh, that sounds great.
B:	um
B:	It's, it's really good
B:	and you can make it ahead of time and then, um, make the sauce when you're ready to, um, to serve it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's one of my favorite things to, to serve.
A:	Well, um, I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party.
B:	Sure.
A:	But if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Well, I guess being from that part of the country.
A:	Because, I mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish
A:	but you know, I, I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like, uh,
A:	shrimp, shrimp fettucini is real easy to, um, make and everything
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's usually well liked by people, I guess,
A:	I'm just a seafood fan
A:	so, I think on the lines of,
B:	Well, how do, make, how do you, you cook crawfish?
B:	I, in fact, I just came back from the grocery store
B:	and being in Texas we don't have too many, you know, people that, that eat crawfish
B:	but they had live crawfish, on sale.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	um, you're not supposed to, I mean, you're not supposed to eat them dead.
A:	I mean, well, you eat them dead
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but,
B:	Don't buy them that way
A:	Right.
A:	Because if, if they are dead for too long,
A:	you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, I'll remember that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so if you ever go in a restaurant, order crawfish,
A:	I mean, every once in a while you'll see
A:	I mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident
A:	but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah, don't eat it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, you just put some Cajun, well, lots of pepper
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you just boil them
A:	and they're absolutely wonderful
A:	but there's, uh, they're a pain to peel for some people.
A:	Once you get used to it they're real easy
A:	but, um, you know, if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot.
B:	Huh. When you were, um, when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too?
A:	I think for a dinner party
A:	I, I don't know
A:	it depends.
B:	Um-hum.
A:	Like if, like my age, if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, I, they would shell their own,
B:	Sure.
A:	you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something
A:	but, um, if it was more formal like if I was, you know, working environment then I would probably, um, shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head
A:	But there's a, There's a, big thing over here that everybody sucks the head.
B:	Still have see that. *slash error Ooh *slash error should be 'ba'
A:	So, um it, it would just depend.
A:	That's the best part of the crawfish.
A:	Sucking the head
A:	But um I don't know
A:	it it just depends on what type it was I guess
A:	But you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything
A:	And usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um You know make a sauce with or something like that
B:	Um-hum
A:	But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
A:	and they're more expensive of course
A:	but
B:	Does it taste a lot like shrimp
A:	Um Yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own
A:	It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
B:	Sure
A:	but um I think that
A:	And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps
B:	Yeah.
B:	We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time
B:	And
A:	That's what I need
B:	Yeah
B:	that's what I wish I had
B:	but in our family I am the one who who cooks
B:	And I I really enjoy it
B:	it's gotten a little more difficult with kids
B:	But I really do enjoy cooking
B:	And we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me
A:	Oh!
B:	and we we
B:	was really a lot of fun
A:	I bet
B:	and
A:	that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe
B:	Yeah
B:	it did
B:	we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other
A:	That would be fun
B:	or
B:	Uh it was a lot of fun you know
B:	it something unique you know
B:	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know
A:	Uh huh
B:	It was a lot of fun
A:	Sometimes it might be the candlelight
A:	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something
B:	That's right
A:	Well that's you know that's fun
B:	it was fun
B:	and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying
A:	Uh huh
A:	That sounds right I would I'd take him up on that
B:	I'm
B:	It does
B:	except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again
A:	Uh huh
A:	I'd be
B:	make hot dogs or some potato chips
A:	I that's about how much I can cook You know
A:	I'm I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to
B:	Uh-huh
A:	but that's only because my mom just started working
A:	so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon
A:	so I try to have things cooked for her
A:	but uh um I usually try to stay out of kitchen
B:	Oh that's nice
A:	I don't know
A:	not one of my favorite hobbies
B:	It can it can be fun I if you have the time
B:	But you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able to
A:	Well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and and Easter
A:	whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
A:	and it has
A:	I don't know
A:	they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs
A:	and they are absolutely delicious
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I don't know what she calls them in
A:	I don't I'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol
A:	But
A:	um
A:	I don't know
A:	I would I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
B:	Yeah
B:	it's um it's in the other room
B:	I don't know if we have enough time for it
A:	Oh
B:	it's real easy
B:	one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings
B:	you can just light
A:	Yeah
B:	so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different um
A:	Oh
A:	that would be wonderful
B:	makes them a little bit crunchy
B:	you need to chop em up real fine
A:	Yeah
B:	But um it makes them crunchy
B:	and that adds something new to it
B:	And then the sauce is just made with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
A:	Um-hum
A:	Oh
B:	So it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce
B:	it's more of a
B:	when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food
A:	Um-hum
B:	And it gives it a bit of a different consistency
A:	Well um how long do you cook the meatballs
B:	The meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're uh browned on all all sides
A:	Uh huh
B:	and then drain off all the grease
B:	Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them
B:	And then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it
A:	Oh
A:	yeah
B:	probably you have to heat it up for a good oh
B:	if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out
B:	But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself
B:	Let them simmer in the sauce itself
A:	Hum
B:	and it's real good
A:	That sounds great
A:	Especially I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance
B:	Right.
A:	I mean like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend
B:	And then freeze them
B:	Sure
A:	That would be great
A:	I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope to have to have lots of dinner parties Cause I like to
A:	I mean um Um I'm sure that I'll be involved in a big company
A:	and I know that my future husband will be You know
A:	He's going to be working for Chevron in Houston
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so he's going to be
A:	Um You know I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy
B:	Yeah
B:	you'll meet friends
B:	invite invite the boss over and and friends at work
A:	Oh yeah
A:	I have to impress the boss and clients cause Um I'm in I'm in public relations in school
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I'm going to have You know my whole job's going to be based on my clients 'n stuff like that
A:	so I'm going to have lots of dinner parties
B:	Sure.
A:	And have to take 'em out to eat
A:	Right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy * Did she really say "ettiquesy"??
A:	and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know
B:	Oh
B:	really
A:	I mean I thought for sure I'd been raised properly
A:	but I've been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about
A:	but um So Is there anything else
B:	Well I I think we've covered the subject
B:	I got some interesting information about crawfish
B:	I was in fact
B:	It's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale
A:	Oh
A:	yes
A:	you need to try em
A:	Oh they're wonderful.
B:	Oh I will
B:	I'm sure my husband will be surprised, 'cause we were talking about them the other day before
A:	Okay,
A:	so which, uh, what basketball teams are you interested in?
B:	Well, I guess I'm a big Laker, L A Laker fan, when it comes to pros.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the college ranks, um, I guess I really,
B:	of course I try to follow my alma mater,
B:	that's, uh, B Y U, in Utah.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	But they don't have much of a team usually.
A:	No,
A:	they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You see them in football on T V once in awhile.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You never see them on a, on nationally basketball.
A:	You know, that's true.
A:	I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball.
B:	They, uh, last year they had a really good team,
B:	the year that Danny Aines was there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was about five, six years ago by now.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, they made it to the sweet sixteen, once or twice, in their history,
A:	Um.
A:	That's not too bad.
B:	and that's,
B:	and they usually lose in the first round.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I'm, uh, originally from the Saint Louis area,
A:	so the only basketball team, pro anyway, in that part of the country is Chicago.
A:	So, I, I do pull for Chicago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a, a Chicago fan, I guess, because they're doing pretty good.
B:	Is it the Bulls you're talking about?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the pro,
A:	Um, as far as college teams, uh, I know it's really easy to say,
A:	but I've been pulling for, uh, Duke for about four years now
A:	so, uh, so, I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although, I've, I've really, you know,
B:	Is that right?
A:	again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but they're on, uh, probation this year
A:	so you can't do much about that.
B:	No,
B:	no.
A:	But, uh,
B:	So, did you watch the, uh, final four this year?
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I watched every, uh, I watched all three games of that.
B:	Every game?
A:	And, uh, I was very pleased with all three games, because Kansas, uh,
A:	you know, I was pulling for Kansas on the other side,
A:	so it was real nice to have the, the teams that were there.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Of course, I wasn't really,
A:	I mean, I, I,
A:	U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a, uh, uh, oh, I don't know, a macho team, you know,
A:	they just didn't seem, they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
A:	and, and maybe they were,
A:	but, um, I was real happy to see them get knocked off.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I watched that game.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was a good game.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It was a very close game, and hard fought game.
B:	And it just,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it looked like U N L V may have had more, uh, talent,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, as far as playing together as a team that day, it didn't, Duke seemed to have them off balance.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that, uh, they didn't, couldn't,
B:	aren't they more of a running gun team ?
A:	U N L V,
A:	yeah,
A:	they, they play the pro style, is, what I've always called it.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	fast breaks and things and,
A:	yeah,
A:	the fast breaks and, and,
B:	They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed
B:	and,
A:	Right.
A:	And, uh, U N L V wasn't used to that.
A:	Of course, I've, I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time,
A:	see I don't know if they were necessarily behind,
A:	but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, and, you know, that meant that they had to play a second half
A:	and they, they've not had to do that all year
A:	and, uh,
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	They didn't have, they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year
B:	and that, and that, so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that, right in, when it, when it counts so much.
A:	That's right.
A:	I mean Duke's schedule was, was so much harder than U N L V's that it, uh, it just made them a much tougher team overall,
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, that had to help them a lot.
B:	I think, I think that, that probably was the difference in that game.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know.
A:	So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, uh,  will win
B:	Well,
A:	or,
B:	I don't know.
B:	Probably not.
A:	I mean, Portland's pretty good. Um,
B:	Since Kareem's retired,  they haven't had a center.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, they've got Perkins,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't think he's really been a super star for them.
A:	No.
A:	Well, he's, uh,
A:	I don't,
A:	I,
A:	he, he to me is not a center,
A:	he's more of a, a real tall forward
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh,
B:	So,
A:	I think Magic does a,
B:	They'll make it, you know,
B:	it, it's going to be a war between, uh, between Chicago and, uh, and, uh, uh, Boston Celtics.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's going to be a war.
A:	That sure is.
A:	It,
B:	It's going to be a great series.
A:	I think that's going to be one of those that's, uh, that's won by the home team, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think.
B:	One of those two will probably be, um, in there,
B:	um, let me see,
B:	where does Detroit fit in?
A:	Detroit's in that same, uh, that, that same, uh, division.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I don't know,
B:	those three,
B:	uh, Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year.
A:	No,
A:	but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, that might help them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They have the, they have the play-off experience,
B:	but,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	so does Detroit, I mean, so does Chicago. So all three of them do, with Larry Bird back, uh,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's,  starting to click on all cylinders.
A:	That's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They say he's starting to do, starting to play,
A:	He's, yeah but he's been, yeah, but he's been kind of up and down all year.
B:	Right.
A:	uh, one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
A:	and then the next time he'll, you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I don't know,
B:	Right.
A:	I'm, I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year.
B:	Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that's when,   you do it.
B:	He's,   starting to be more consistent, you know, right at the right time of the year.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, any dark horses I, uh, you know,
A:	Well, the dark horses,
B:	San Antonio,  San Antonio is the dark horse that could, could really flip in there, I think.
A:	Yeah
A:	that's,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, anybody who has David Robinson, has got to have a chance anyway.
B:	Yeah.
B:	He's got to be pretty much, you know,
B:	I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player, you know, when he,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	against any team he would dominate,
B:	but Robinson's getting up there where , every game, he's just,
A:	That's right.
B:	I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk
B:	and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's, when he's driving hard to the hoop.
A:	Huh.
A:	the first thing,
A:	uh, what do you think you would offer as far as, uh, information about selecting a school?
B:	Well, first I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to, what they want to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, once they have that, then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves, and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of, uh, of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer.
A:	Yeah, uh,
A:	do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,
A:	depending upon the field, I know there are some fields which a person should go to the school, that school, all four years,
A:	but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot fields are,
B:	most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway.
B:	It's, it's your core education, your general general education requirements.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, if, you know, if they want to get a liberal arts degree, I don't, I don't know what advice I'd give them.
B:	Go to the school you'd like to go to.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's what I did
A:	Yeah.
B:	I didn't care about the program or anything else.
B:	I went where I wanted to go.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What was your degree in?
B:	Uh, political science.
A:	Political science, oh,
A:	okay.
A:	Well, I I know, I'm going to school right now,
A:	and, uh, I have a friend,
B:	Where are you at?
A:	Uh, U T D.
A:	University of Texas, Dallas.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I guess, everybody's in Dallas that I talk to.
B:	I'm in, North Carolina.
A:	I know.
A:	That's where Texas Instruments is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	Um, something that I, I think that I've noticed that
A:	I, I have a friend,
A:	I think if you're going into like, uh, law or medicine, a very particular, very specific field, even, even engineering, you can get, you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public, um, institution.
B:	Sure.
A:	And, uh, it's a lot cheaper.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	My parents, my parents made a mistake in, uh, in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years.
B:	Um.
A:	And she found out after that,
A:	she said, you know, my parents, they just, they really wasted a lot of money.
A:	This is about twenty years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, well, right now I just,
A:	I mean as far as selecting, selecting a school, I, I, I feel that, uh, a lot of it depends upon the major.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does. Um,
B:	I didn't know what I wanted to do after I got my, my degree.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, originally I had planned, uh, undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration.
B:	And I went ahead and pursued that.
B:	I, I got as far as the thesis, and decided, To hell with it,
B:	I didn't want it.
B:	Um, and from that point I went to law school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either
A:	Okay.
B:	Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And so, but I, I, I really did enjoy the law.
B:	I mean, that's, that's where I wanted to be,
B:	but I didn't want to go through the, uh, the hassle that the law schools put you through, because I never did want to be a practicing attorney.
B:	I just wanted a law degree.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field. Because that's the nuts and bolts of the law, and that's what I like,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to.
A:	Right.
B:	So that's, that's what I'm pursuing right now
A:	Um.
B:	and I'm pretty happy with it so far.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm, I'm pursuing what they, what's, what's called an interdisciplinary field.
A:	I'm a speech therapy major
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and fortunately I have a lot of, I have a good medical background,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	that's probably very useful.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's actually turning out to be more, more useful than what I thought.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, I also have a good languages background, linguistics. And some psychology.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it's all working together.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The only field I'm not familiar with really is education, which is required, requires about four or five different fields really.
B:	Oh, good grief.
A:	So it's a,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher,
B:	but I, I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while, just to get my feet wet.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I said, uh, I couldn't do this everyday.
B:	No way.
A:	Well.
B:	Maybe, maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing, but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing.
A:	Oh, so you are a disgruntled graduate student
B:	I am a I am, I am just a disgruntled person all around
A:	Oh
B:	I'm the, uh, I'm the, uh, original, uh, Mister Scrooge, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Bah, humbug.
B:	Yeah,
B:	bah, humbug.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just,
A:	I, I, I think,
A:	yeah,
A:	there is,
A:	I, I, I think, uh, law would be a fine field, a fine profession, fine field to go into.
A:	Um, I know one time I was in a political science class,
A:	and you know, talking about fields, people going into different fields, I made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers, about their integrity being questionable.
A:	And I mean, oh, that was like a can of worms.
B:	Probably, you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.
A:	No,
A:	there was a woman,
A:	she said a My, my best friends are lawyers a and you know, all this,
A:	and it was just
B:	Well, that remark in itself is a slam a
B:	My best friends are lawyers a
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	You know, like, like, uh, my best friends are blacks
A:	Or Jewish,
A:	it used to be Jewish, you know.
B:	Jewish,
B:	now blacks
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I guess, I, I, guess Iraqi now is the
A:	I know,
A:	it's,
A:	but,
B:	Law, law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it doesn't become fun anymore.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a I have a friend.
A:	She's studying, she's going into law,
A:	another friend going into law,
A:	and, she's,
A:	I, I, I'm really, I'm really concerned about, you know,
A:	she's just going to be, you know,
A:	what's going to happen when she gets there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you going,
A:	You know, all of her dreams will be dispelled
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if, if, if you've ever seen the program PAPER CHASE it's very much like that, except worse.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's I, I think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful.
B:	It is.
A:	I see I see that happening.
B:	Yeah,
B:	very much so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's a lot of that. Um
A:	Yeah.
B:	it, it was enjoyable for a while, um,
B:	but it's such a grind
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you begin to wonder, you know,
B:	if, if I'm not, I mean,
B:	you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If you have any doubts whatsoever, you better not get into it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard,
B:	and I aged ten years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I, I, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world.
B:	It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I went to a language school,
A:	and, and that was a, it was a, an I guess, uh, United States institution.
A:	I was military at the time
A:	And I, I think probably the biggest.
B:	What branch were you in?
A:	Huh?
B:	What branch were you in?
A:	I was in the Air Force?
B:	I was too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	for myself, I mean, I think that military experience was fine,
A:	it was just, I just wish that there was something else that, that, that I could have done, you know, with,
B:	Well, I got, I got tired of the service after a while, I mean
B:	it,
B:	I had a terrific job, really enjoyed it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what, what was your job?
B:	Uh, command post.
A:	Uh, I was, I was a linguist
B:	I was just wondering, were you in SAC by any chance?
A:	Um.
B:	Were you in SAC?
A:	In Tak?
B:	SAC.
A:	Uh, no
A:	I wasn't.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	I, I thought maybe you might have had some experience with the, uh, R C one thirty-fives.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I didn't, I didn't go flight crew.
A:	Matter of fact, I didn't make it completely through that, through that field.
A:	I, was in intelligence school and about three weeks short.
B:	Oh.
A:	I didn't make it,
A:	I sort of washed out.
B:	Well,
B:	Well.
A:	Yeah
A:	after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training, you know, it's, it's something, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's why, you know, children really need to think about the field they're going to, going into, and I mean, spend a lot of serious reading before they, I mean, not just thinking about.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They actually should do some reading
B:	That's right,
B:	and it, And if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it.
A:	and they should study it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I, I think, I think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	sure.
A:	I mean, they, they find out whether, just how much of a people person they are.
B:	That's true,
B:	I found that out when I was in high school.
B:	I worked at McDonald's.
A:	Oh, and I tell you what,
A:	I worked at McDonald's as well,
A:	and I, I can tell you one thing,
A:	there are just some people that I, you know,
A:	you just came to the point where I mean,
A:	and oh, I eventually worked in a lab, in a as a lab technician,
A:	and I worked front desk.
A:	And I mean, somebody could walk in the door,
A:	and I knew exactly what they were going to do and say.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	I was the same way too.
B:	I'm not a people person.
B:	I, I, I hate, um, having to play such a nice guy. You know, especially when it's all phony. Especially when you got some, uh, jerk coming in.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I,
B:	it's just not for me.
B:	I'm, uh, I deal much better in research and books, and stuff like that which is why I'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
A:	I was just wondering, um, getting back to the school thing, so, I, I almost wish that there was something ...
B:	What kind of a car do you drive now?
A:	I drive a Honda Prelude.
B:	Do you?
B:	I drive a Honda Accord.
A:	Oh, yeah
B:	Yeah
A:	I bought mine a year ago
A:	so I'm not buying a car any time soon.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me either.
B:	I just bought mine, uh,
B:	it will be a year in August.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I love it though.
B:	I love Hondas.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It,
B:	I think I found my car.
A:	Well, I, I like where all the controls are they're, they're in good spots
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, really,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I have a standard.
A:	But, um,
A:	I,
A:	it's, an it's supposedly real reliable
A:	the only thing I've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I hadn't heard that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What did you have before you bought that.
A:	I had a Buick Regal.
B:	Did you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I had, uh, a Mazda R X Seven before that
B:	and that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life.
A:	The Buick was, was great.
A:	It was nine years old
A:	and it, was still going strong.
B:	Really?
A:	The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it, I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old.
B:	Really?
A:	And that was the only major problem that I had, I mean,
A:	I had like little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I had replaced the tires
A:	and, uh, seems like it had a radiator leak once.
A:	But I never had any major anything, other than the compressor.
B:	Right.
B:	I really never had anything major with my Mazda
B:	but it was a standard also
B:	and the clutch went out on it toward the end,
B:	I had it five years
B:	and the last year, last two years it seemed to go out really easily.
B:	I think it went out twice in two years
B:	and that's, that's a lot
B:	it shouldn't go out that much.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda
B:	but I don't think I'm going to do that again.
B:	I think I'm going back to automatic now.
A:	Well, I never, well,
A:	I kind of know how to drive standard
A:	but I've never owned one
A:	so I hadn't, I don't drive one a lot.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it.
B:	Right.
A:	And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	And, and resale value is really important to me
B:	That's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is me too
B:	that's why I got the Honda.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Hondas have great resale value.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The Mazda definitely did not
B:	Not at all.
B:	They're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes.
A:	I did pretty well with my, uh, Regal because it was in really good shape
A:	but, it still looked real nice,
B:	Yeah.
A:	the, the interior was still really nice,
A:	there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff.
B:	Right.
A:	And it had some, some nice features.
A:	So I ended up okay with the Buick,
B:	Good.
A:	and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it,
A:	of course, I may never sell it
B:	Right.
A:	I may drive it until it's dead
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's what I did with the Mazda, drive it until the, until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, probably what I'll do again.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I really like the Hondas.
B:	I like foreign cars a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well,
B:	I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant.
B:	I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was so small
B:	and it's really impractical.
B:	So, I wanted something with a real trunk, and four doors something easy to get in and out of
B:	and I looked at the Galant
B:	and those were really nice
B:	and I can get them for a great price.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I found it hard to deal with the, the dealership I was going through.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, that's how I ended up with a Honda.
A:	I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car.
A:	I, uh, I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something
A:	so and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore
A:	and it was only like a year old
A:	and I had never driven, uh, a Prelude.
A:	So, I went to a dealership because they had like, uh, the same year and same model, of Prelude on their used car lot
B:	Right.
A:	and I went and I test drove it
A:	and, you know, I just fell in love, with this brand new white Prelude, uh, you know, two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	They're nice I think.
A:	and I, bought it loaded.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I have to have them loaded,
A:	Oh,
B:	um, I love all those little things that you don't need
B:	but they're so wonderful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I went there looking at a used car
A:	and two days later I bought this car.
A:	I felt like, I felt like that was the worst impulse, that was, that was largest impulse that I, that I had ever made.
A:	The the two, other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer and dryer.
B:	I understand.
A:	I go for the big stuff.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I noticed
B:	Mine was definitely not impulse
B:	I really needed a new car.
B:	Mine was just, it was getting worn out I guess from being a sports car.
B:	I drove it kind of hard,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I got it right after high school.
B:	So, by the time I traded it in it was ready.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I got, I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift.
B:	Did you?
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I guess this wasn't really an impulse, I mean,
A:	buying it right then and, you know, right quickly was kind of impulsive
A:	but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years
A:	and I was just scared to.
B:	Right.
A:	I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for.
B:	Right.
B:	That's the same with me.
B:	Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself?
A:	Buy a, you, buy a used car?
B:	Like,
B:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	I, I was going to buy one once
B:	but I just, I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Just, I can't seem to get over that.
B:	That just bothers me
B:	I don't know why.
A:	Well, um, like on Hondas they,
A:	supposedly, the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever
A:	and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
A:	and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	I mean they can't stop you from doing it.
B:	Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea from a, if you can get a good mechanic to, check it over real carefully and check the block and everything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	So.
B:	Well, I guess that's all.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Anyway, what are your, what are your first comments on that pauses and subject?
B:	Uh, my first comments on the budget.
B:	I would say there has,
A:	What would you start cutting
A:	what would be the first thing you'd cut?
A:	Defense?
B:	Surprisingly, no.
B:	I would, I would cut the prison systems and let them self-support.
A:	Mean private enterprise?
B:	Huh?
A:	Have private enterprise do it?
B:	You mean the prisons?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're already talking about it.
A:	I mean, they're talking about, uh, having it, uh, as a, you know, business. Uh, to, uh, you know, to, so, the, you know, the government doesn't have to deal with it.
B:	I hadn't heard that.
A:	But, uh, yeah,
A:	because I think it's all funded, either state or federally funded
A:	so,  or, uh, obviously.
B:	Right.
A:	So, but, uh,  But see they're, they don't have enough, uh, uh, you know, there's, there's not enough room in these prisons and that, and that, uh, to continue funding it.
B:	But to me it,
A:	They think they need to, maybe have, uh, you know, private, you know, business, private enterprise come in.
A:	So,
B:	Well, see the other way I'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting, like, uh, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves.
B:	In other words, they're in there for a purpose,
B:	put them to work rather than sitting there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's the same thing like the whole criminal, I shouldn't say criminal, but the whole police department of the United States.
B:	I feel the same way.
B:	Uh, someone gets picked up for drunk driving,
B:	he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's self you know, self-defense on that point.
B:	Uh, as far as my defense budget, uh, they're cutting it back now, what, twenty-five percent?
B:	I wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But again I'd like to see something on the other end back into education. But not in the education we have today.
B:	So I'm lost on that one.
B:	I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems. And to come up with something a little better than what we've got.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	its tough to, to say what, uh, you know, what, uh,
A:	as far as this, that good or bad or what.
A:	But, uh, I was just talking to somebody else,
A:	and all those European countries, they pay all the way through college and stuff like that.
A:	They,
A:	so, uh,
B:	Well, not so much pay.
B:	I'm not trying to see the government put out any more.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know what you are saying.
A:	But I'm just saying that even the differences, uh, is that, you know, some countries pay for students to go to, through college and etcetera.
A:	But here, it, you know, it's just up to high school.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But see, we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college. To go either as an apprentice, which they, they do in other countries. Just doing it, which I think would bring the education back up. You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	why not an apprentice out to a, a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or, you know, just a technician?
B:	You can learn on the job. Which, of course, again, which would mean, again,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	our education budget will go down if this is,
B:	in a few years, I mean it's not going to be overnight.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But that would come down.
A:	I think the you know, that's one reason, uh, you know, we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board. Uh,
A:	they're not willing to, you know, to put that, you know, the training for only a certain amount.
A:	So, uh, it's, you know, as far as the technical side.
A:	But, uh, even like
A:	one, one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff.
A:	I mean they, they're trying to get more people into that field.
A:	But they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to, you know, school in that area before they can work, you know, for a lawyer as a paralegal.
B:	Excuse me. I see it being done
B:	I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever
B:	and she's training her.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I, I'm, well I, you know, I'm assuming that it can be done. Uh,
A:	my perspective is that, you know, I've been with a couple of big companies now.
A:	And it's like they'd, are unwilling to put the time in.
A:	You know, they want somebody, you know, when they then, when they bring them off, bring them in, that they have something, you know, a certain amount to contribute.
A:	Obviously, there's, uh, you know, there's a lot to learn, uh, after that.
A:	But, but, uh, that's true.
A:	I'm, I'm sure there's a lot of, uh,
A:	you know, businesses are small, you know, small businesses that could, uh.
A:	Let me change my channel,
A:	I've got a cordless phone.
A:	Let me see if that clears this up.
A:	phone Is that better?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
B:	Wow!
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was a cordless phone,
A:	and all of a sudden we had a bad, uh, frequency there or something.
A:	So we had some interference,
A:	so I changed that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere
A:	Anyway, so, uh,
B:	Well,
A:	but, uh, you know, I think, uh, they, maybe they need to, uh, help promote that more. Give incentives like, uh, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is, you know, for them to train people,  you know, stuff like that. Programs like that, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know, you know, what kind of options they've got.
B:	Well, that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing. Something similar to that right now.
B:	And, uh, they have jobs out on, you know, bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields.
B:	But see, that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people. At people, per, at high school level,  which I would like to see. Rather than so many kids getting out of school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They're, they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around. Because they don't have any education.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't mean college.
B:	And I'm for college.
B:	But there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote, quote college is concerned.
B:	They've had it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think, I just heard something the other day,
A:	it was like only, it was either sixty percent or forty percent, go to college.
A:	And then out of that percentage, only so many can get their degree.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I thought that was interesting.
A:	But, uh, you know, most people I knew have gone and got their degree.
A:	So,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But there's a lot of them out there that haven't.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I you know, I,  uh, was basic, in a, you know, middle, upper middle class area,
B:	That's,
A:	and yeah,
A:	so I think, uh, that demographic area there, you know, a lot of them do go on.
A:	And they go to college, etcetera.
B:	Because you can get just as far as being a journeyman, carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that. Make as much money
B:	and if they enjoy it more, they'll make a happier life for themselves.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Question.
B:	You threw that question on me about the deficit,
B:	put it on your shoe now.
B:	What would you do?
A:	Well, as as far as the, you know, the deficit, that's a whole nother, uh, my perception of the budget, you know, the government.
A:	And they have so much to spend
A:	and there's not enough money to spread around.
A:	But the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries, and that we have more money or you know, more money going out and too many goods coming into this country, you know.
A:	And, uh, you know, part of that problem, I think, is still, you know, uh,
A:	like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country.
A:	And, and obviously the, the demand for their goods is quite high here,
A:	so they can get their goods in here.
A:	And, uh, you know, to start even that out we need to continue to, you know, at least threaten that, you know,
A:	we're going to give them higher tariffs, etcetera to raise their prices to, you know, ours.
A:	But, uh, it's just that, uh, they're, eh,
A:	I think you're, you're going to find that just because the United States, you know, there is such a demand here, the market, you know.
A:	And, uh, uh, the you know, money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell, you know, we don't, uh, sell products abroad as much as we bring in.
A:	So,
B:	Were you watching,
B:	I think, uh,
B:	one of the news stations. I couldn't even tell you which one I watched. But they had on there, where the, the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	what kind of puppy you got?
A:	Well, uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd.
A:	Uh, she was, uh, uh,
A:	a person lives across the street from me, uh, brought her home from work because a coworker of hers, uh, had this dog appear on its front doorstep,
B:	Uh.
A:	somebody, somebody abandoned her
A:	and, she's only about, oh, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
B:	Oh.
A:	She's, I mean she's that, this young
A:	and she's almost housebroken.
B:	Wow.
A:	I mean she actually asks to go out.
B:	That's great.
A:	And, uh, yeah
A:	I was amazed.
A:	Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	she just appeared.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my husband calls her street dog,
B:	but we've had her now for about three years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just,
B:	you get so attached to them.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I had a, uh,
A:	last year I had I had another German Shepherd,
A:	now this one was purebred
A:	and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door
A:	but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
B:	Um.
B:	Wow.
A:	um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy,
A:	and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing
A:	and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
B:	Oh no.
A:	So, I couldn't believe it.
A:	That was, that was really hard.
B:	Oh, gee.
A:	And that was even harder for,
A:	I was on a business trip at the time
A:	and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
B:	Oh, I bet.
A:	And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me
A:	because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did
A:	and, uh. She was really attached to it,
B:	Oh gosh.
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate,
A:	but now, I've got another one,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	How long has it been since the first one?
A:	Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
B:	Uh, yeah,
A:	Uh, it was in March of last year.
A:	So, uh, yeah,
A:	it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one
B:	and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me.
B:	I mean I was just, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I couldn't even talk about it for months
B:	and so I decided well that's it,
B:	I'm not going to do this anymore
A:	Right.
B:	And then God gave me this dog,
B:	so
A:	My dad's like that,
A:	he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved
A:	and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog,
A:	there's no way,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	no
A:	how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October
A:	and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, I or, I Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And she, she turned out to be a great dog
A:	and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently
A:	and again dad went through the whole thing,
A:	but, mom went an,
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well you just do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you can't help
B:	it's like, it's like a kid.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
B:	Yeah,
B:	well when, uh,
B:	my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
A:	Yeah.
B:	like who knows, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	she doesn't have a brown nose,
B:	and her she's sort of unicolor, you know, eyes are the same color and everything,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so. I named her Rosebud,
B:	and, uh, a friend of mine said, she, that she
B:	this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud
B:	and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name,
B:	said my cow lived seventeen years
A:	That's not too bad.
A:	Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too,
A:	they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	they're always, always happy.
A:	I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
B:	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, she loves everybody.
B:	And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
A:	Right.
B:	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
A:	This, this friend of mine has, well
A:	it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit,
A:	but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took,
A:	he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever
A:	and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy
A:	and we went and took the two dogs up fishing.
A:	And this,
A:	they just, they had a ball romping around,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
B:	Getting in,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current,
A:	and, uh.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Well no,
A:	actually he had no trouble at all.
A:	He first jumped in
A:	and I,
A:	he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really,
A:	I don't think he'd swum before.
B:	Really.
A:	But he jumped in, in the, the river.
B:	Did puppy go to?
A:	Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,
A:	I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
B:	Oh, that's good,
B:	yeah.
A:	'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her.
A:	And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
B:	Ugh,
B:	ugh.
A:	And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her,
A:	but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up
A:	and then, he, he jumped in again,
A:	and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon.
A:	He loved it.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though.
A:	She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out.
A:	I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so, but, uh, she got over it,
A:	so.
B:	Well the German Shepherd that I had before,
B:	we, we had a little pool,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming
B:	but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step.
B:	She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um,
A:	it's on Oneida lake
A:	and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year.
A:	I mean, I've got,
A:	the yard's all fenced in
A:	so she doesn't run loose,
A:	but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah
B:	Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and she,
B:	oh baths.
B:	Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything.
B:	It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Have you seen, uh, CANINE. The movie, oh,
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German,
B:	it is so cute.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up
B:	and it's, it's just hysterical.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too.
A:	And that was the thing I couldn't figure out
A:	because he would go in the lake,
A:	it wasn't like he didn't
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet,
A:	but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well that's how Cleo, you know,
B:	she'd lay on her step,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet
B:	and she didn't want you getting her wet
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	obstinate,
A:	obstinate.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but you really need to see that movie.
B:	I, I we bought the movie
B:	and I I don't know how many times I've seen it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it came on T V the other night
B:	and I was watching it again,
B:	and my husband heard me laughing
B:	and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
A:	I'll have to check it out.
A:	I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all
A:	and it did look like it'd be a good movie,
A:	but,
B:	It is great.
A:	uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I got to do more, more fun things.
B:	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force
A:	and so I travel a lot.
B:	Oh really.
A:	And yeah,
A:	I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here,
A:	so.
B:	Oh.
A:	That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's nice having a dog here, uh,
A:	the,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	there's just,
A:	uh,
A:	what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
B:	Right,
B:	that's it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Really,
B:	not critical at all.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're really wonderful.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's been nice talking to you,
A:	we seem to be degenerating here,
A:	so
A:	Well, uh, I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the, uh, jury system, do you?
B:	Uh, not at all.
B:	In fact, I'm graduating from college in about a week
B:	and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials.
A:	Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do
B:	Uh, I think, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, should, you know, is fine.
B:	I think it should be by a jury.
B:	I don't think the judge should have, I mean
B:	he's just there kind of like the referee
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,
A:	Well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?
A:	I thought that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But, if there are some people who don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't know.
B:	I, uh,
B:	you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, falsely accused
B:	but, uh, more than likely the people that are on the, the jury know what they're doing.
B:	Uh, I mean you,
A:	Really?
A:	Have you served on a jury?
B:	Never.
A:	I never have either,
A:	but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just the opposite
A:	They say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. And, uh, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to, to air, and all that.
B:	Huh. Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh,
B:	when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out
B:	and I, I know they automatically,
B:	when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that,
B:	that you're automatically,
B:	no
B:	they don't want you on the jury.
A:	Right,
A:	, they don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	exactly.
B:	Uh,
A:	And they tend,
A:	and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it,
A:	I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury just about,
A:	and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that,
A:	if I were let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'd be, I mean I'd be tried by a jury of you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things,
A:	and, uh, I don't know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I get a little bit nervous about it,
A:	and, uh,
B:	I've, I've never I've never even been called to jury duty.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I was called once,
A:	but I was out of the country,
A:	and apparently I, apparently they thought I served
A:	so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it
A:	I came back
A:	and they said the record showed I served,
A:	but I was out of the country at the time,
A:	so I'm pretty sure I didn't.
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh, I don't know,
B:	I think the, I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I I, I don't know,
A:	I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous
A:	because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury,  a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that's hard to say.
A:	Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks
A:	and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
B:	Right.
A:	And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh,
A:	and from what I hear,
A:	I, I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony
A:	and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know,
A:	the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim,
A:	and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know,
A:	it's just a big faceless corporation.
A:	Let's, let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, not,
A:	I, I mean, I'm,
A:	the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury,
A:	but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be,  things like that.
B:	I, uh, I I, I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow?
A:	I wonder if that's possible?
A:	I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
B:	judge
A:	They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
B:	Right,
B:	exactly
A:	He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
B:	Probably,
B:	yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, no,
B:	it's, it's sad, though, that, uh, that the people, though, that
B:	you, you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands
B:	and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, or they fool the, the defense in thinking that they're, you know,
B:	because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
A:	Oh, of course.
A:	It's, it's political maneuvering.
A:	The, the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang everyone,
A:	and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic.
A:	They're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror. *whose who's
A:	Neither side wants that.
A:	They want to find a juror that's going to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Uh, I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually.
A:	I mean, I know, it, it, it's tricky
A:	because I know, you know, an awful lot of intelligent people who just, well
A:	I'm too busy to serve on a jury,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I'll tell them that
A:	and they won't, or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well,
A:	they just say do you believe in such and such.
A:	Uh,
B:	I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know.
B:	If it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was innocent
B:	and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
A:	Right.
A:	Course, they'd be, they would be barred,
A:	but
B:	But, uh, if everyone would take it, I think if everyone took it seriously
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I hope we're called up before too long.
B:	I would love to be called,
B:	I'm ready to go
B:	They just haven't called me up yet
A:	They will, they will eventually.
A:	Okay,
A:	well it was nice talking with you.
B:	It was nice talking to you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right.
B:	Have you ever been drug tested?
A:	Um, that's a good question.
A:	Um,  I had a job I had to go get a blood test for.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um,
A:	and, and they did a full blood screen on me,
A:	but they didn't call that a drug test.
A:	So
A:	I think they checked for drugs.
A:	They just don't tell you they did.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I had, I've had, uh, two or three drug tests that I had to get before I could start working at a job uh, different jobs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had one at T I and then one at another engineering company.
B:	And, really, I mean, I don't mind them.
B:	I don't do drugs anyway.
B:	I guess if I did, maybe I would
B:	but, um, I don't know.
B:	I know a girl that, she's a nurse,
B:	and they get drug tested randomly.
B:	I've,  never been randomly drug tested.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it.
A:	Yeah
A:	Well, I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
B:	Yeah.
B:	I guess so.
B:	deeply while saying the first I guess I guess so
B:	Do you think that it's right?
A:	Well, I, I, I come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm a, a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I've done employee assistant work
A:	and I, I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents,  on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	and it's like in the billions of dollars every year. Um,
A:	and the only way that they can prevent that is, is, you know, making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free.
B:	That's true.
A:	And, you know, the, the problem in the work place is that, that people are,
A:	like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever, I mean, you can come to, come to work drunk and get in an accident
A:	and he'll cover up for you
A:	and,  nobody knows about it,
B:	Right.
A:	but you know, ends up costing the company lots and lots of money.
B:	That's true.
A:	So,
B:	I believe,  it's right, especially for certain jobs.
A:	you know ,
B:	I think anyone in a, in a public job like bus drivers, and cab drivers, and police officers, and things like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think they should be randomly drug tested.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I believe,  full force in that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be.
A:	True.
B:	You know, secretaries aren't, aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something.
B:	So, I don't know.
B:	I, I'm kind of biased, too, because I don't do drugs
B:	and,  so, I really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me. Because I have nothing to worry about.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I guess that's kind of biased.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, there,
A:	it's, I, I think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It does.
A:	Because, generally you know it.
A:	Uh, you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	And if, even if, like you say, even if it's just the secretary,
A:	if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it, it's still a problem.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	So,
B:	But, what do you do about,  the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before
B:	and, you know, it's, it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything
B:	and they happen to be tested Monday morning
B:	and they could be fired for that?
B:	You know, that, that's kind of unfair, also.
A:	Well, yeah .
A:	I guess it comes with the turf.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I guess so.
B:	I guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
A:	Yeah.
A:	Man.
A:	And, in terms of drugs, they're illegal.
A:	So you're,  you're breaking the law anyway.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's true.
A:	Probably the, the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of, of assessing for alcohol.
B:	That's true.
A:	And that's probably the biggest problem there is
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think so, more than drugs
B:	And I know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They would pay for an alcohol
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation.
A:	Well, I guess that's one of the positive things that have come out of it, some of the employee assistance program.
A:	If you do test positive for something they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job. *you're your
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	And I,
B:	I,  think that's fair.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the the company benefits in the long run.
B:	Yeah
B:	That's true
B:	That's about all I have,  to say on it
A:	What, what kind of testing do they do when you went?
B:	Uh, it's a urine test.
A:	Urine screen.
B:	And,  they, uh,
A:	Yeah,
B:	it was really very official.
B:	You have to go in a room solely by yourself, sign papers that say you were totally alone, sign papers that say this is yours,
B:	and, and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and, all of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's, I guess, or something.
A:	Well, that happens.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know,
B:	I it's hard to believe,
A:	It happens a lot.
B:	but I guess it does
A:	There, there are people that pay other people to  to help them out.
B:	I know.
B:	I'm amazed,  at the things people, will do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It is amazing.
B:	I guess there are people that do that.
B:	And they are, those are expensive tests.
B:	I'm,  glad I never had to pay for one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It depends really on how, how strong a test it is.
A:	They've got different degrees,  as far as, as how far back they can check.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I guess so.
A:	They got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.
A:	They've some companies that are doing, uh, hair tests.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that,
A:	they'll pull out one of your hairs
A:	and they can apparently test, um, back a certain period of time. Because some of the, the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you know,
B:	How weird.
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	it's kind of,
B:	Oh, that's weird.
A:	Hair follicles, I guess, are just dead protein
A:	and they,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it, it's apparently almost like a, a calendar.
A:	They, they've got it pretty precise now.
A:	They can go back and look at, in terms of growth in a, in a hair, when you used and, and that type of thing.
B:	That's wild.
A:	So
B:	It's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body.
A:	Yeah
A:	So, I guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true
B:	That's true.
B:	I'm glad I never had to do it by giving blood.
B:	I can't stand the thought of giving blood.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't even do it for Wadley, even though it's a good cause
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Well, I did, too.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	So tell me about CHINA CRY.
B:	Okay,
B:	CHINA CRY was basically the, the true story written by this, this lady who had, uh, was a native, a native Chinese, uh, uh, who was raised by Christian parents.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.
A:	I see.
B:	Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, Christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. She had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.
B:	And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed or, or imprisoned or, and the property confiscated, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the Christian movement.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents, well,
B:	her dad was a doctor
B:	and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well to do in the old regime
B:	and the, the the the communist Chinese didn't like this at all.
B:	You know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.
A:	Right.
B:	Everybody was back to a commonality of one.
B:	And so they kept picking at him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started picking on her. And getting her to, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they were starting to, uh, accuse her of, of, of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her write her own story over and over and over.
B:	Uh, and the, uh, the major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court.
B:	Now, I think I'm leaving out a portion.
B:	She she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an instructor
B:	and they had her teaching, or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers. When the, they decided that, that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre, uh, regime crimes as it were.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Being a child, you know.
B:	So, they kept on and on at, at her,
B:	and in the meantime, she and her husband, uh, were were expecting a child, their own child.
B:	And, uh, the, the people kept harassing her over, you know, over a period of months
B:	and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, the Lord just said no,
B:	this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really, you know,
B:	she's, she's one of mine,
B:	she is not going to die
B:	and, uh, the, the soldiers were blinded when they shot.
A:	Huh.
B:	And she, her life was spared.
B:	And this, this frightened the, the, uh, the commandant
B:	and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp.
A:	Huh.
B:	Well, uh, and, course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.
A:	Huh.
B:	Well she, she put in for going, going to, uh,
B:	and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong, uh,
B:	and then she put in to go see him.
B:	And over time she, uh, uh,
B:	finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureaucracy that they finally let her go.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, of course, she had to walk.
B:	You know, they, they stripped her of everything, practically besides the, the clothes on her back.
B:	And, uh, so she, so she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child that they'd already had uh, to freedom.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	And they knew that she wasn't going to come back,
B:	but yeah, she did, years later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life liberalization of China happened,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, she was not persecuted or anything else like that.
A:	Huh. Interesting story.
B:	Yes,
B:	it was.
B:	Uh, very moving, too.
A:	I, uh, I don't even remember seeing that advertised
A:	and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.
B:	Well, it was within, oh, ninety days.
A:	Oh. That recent.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	I mean it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about ninety days.
A:	Oh, I see what you mean.
B:	But it wasn't,
B:	uh, they didn't have it in, uh, too awfully many movie houses,
B:	but it was, it was, in the,
B:	it had large, uh, uh, uh, press release.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, I guess what I, what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was, uh, sort of light by comparison.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy
A:	and, and, uh, we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.
B:	GREEN CARD?
A:	GREEN CARD.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, he chose it
A:	and, uh, it's got this wonderful French actor who's,
A:	it was his, like, his,
A:	and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years,
A:	but he's never made an American film.
A:	This was his American film debut
B:	Oh, I see,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and he speaks very broken English.
A:	And basically he played, uh, a Frenchman who married an American girl, uh, in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card, which is what an alien needs to work in this country.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So she was a horticulturist,
A:	and that was sort of her dream.
B:	Oh, I see,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Of course, you know, they got married
A:	and they never saw each other again.
A:	Except, except fate through them together *through threw
A:	and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, uh, started investigating.
A:	So they had to get back together and get their stories straight,
A:	and, and she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New Yorker
B:	Oh.
A:	and he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,
A:	but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they had to learn all about each other basically in a, in a weekend.
B:	Just then.
A:	And, uh, it was,
A:	you knew what was going to happen, of course. That they would fall in love.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, they fell into like, at any rate
A:	and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever, uh, they did perfectly
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and then he said something, because his English was so poor on, for the most part,
A:	he, he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, I never remember that answer
A:	and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay
B:	Well, did you go to college?
A:	Yes,
A:	I did.
B:	And where did you go?
A:	I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students.
A:	I had gone to a small school growing up, uh,
A:	and a lot of my friends went to University of Michigan
A:	but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, uh, were looking for a southern school and, uh, also U of M seemed overwhelming in size
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, what about you?
B:	I went to the University of Minnesota.
A:	Oh, so you're from the Midwest, too.
B:	I am,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Where do you live now?
A:	Uh, I live in Texas now.
A:	Where are you?
B:	Well, I'm in Texas.
B:	I'm in Austin.
A:	Oh, uh, my brother's in Austin.
A:	Uh, he lives Lakeway.
A:	He, uh, had moved, uh,
A:	we're in Plano.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	I'm familiar with Plano.
B:	I visited once or twice.
A:	Oh, Austin is so pretty.
A:	I really like it
B:	Oh, I love it.
B:	I love it.
B:	I really do.
A:	And your daughter is going to be a sophomore.
B:	That's correct.
B:	I have two daughters,
B:	but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore.
A:	Is, uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas?
B:	She has her heart set on U T.
B:	And, uh, you know, having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what a big university is like.
B:	And, uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I thought might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved in band,
B:	and Baylor has a band camp.
A:	Oh.
B:	So she went for a week,
B:	and it was overnight,
B:	and they lived in the dorms.
B:	And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like on a a smaller college campus.
B:	And, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school.
B:	So, uh, I, I, I still think the exposure was good.
A:	Yes.
B:	The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, well, you know,
B:	what were your selection criteria.
B:	Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford
B:	or, you know, there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider.
A:	Uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south
A:	and because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I,
A:	when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology
A:	and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year
B:	Oh, how exciting.
A:	and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
A:	and I ended up majoring in French.
A:	One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department.
A:	They also had a strong language department
A:	and I'd always loved working with children.
A:	Uh, and I found that I couldn't fit everything in,
A:	but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and so that was some of,
B:	Oh, that was, That worked out very well for you.
A:	but
A:	several of the things you mentioned were the things that, uh, our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M.
A:	He, but he thinks he wants to be a writer
A:	and I don't think that,
B:	Well, then he should come to U T.
A:	Yes
A:	Uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and so he's used to a bigger size
B:	Large classes.
A:	and because my brother is there, uh, he would have family, close by.
A:	So there, there are advantages. Uh,
A:	but I also,
A:	because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan, which was so large
A:	and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.
B:	Oh, I went from a large high school to a large university
B:	and I definitely felt like I was a number.
A:	You still,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I mean, it is a different feeling.
B:	But that was, that was my only option.
B:	I, I mean, I just really couldn't look at anything else.
B:	That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a you know, a junior college, which I didn't want to do.
B:	So that's how, you know, my decision was made.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Well, that's certainly,
A:	uh, especially today with the cost of college.
A:	I mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration
A:	and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools.
A:	And even though Baylor, uh,
B:	Yes.
A:	and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends who have children there who just love it.
A:	And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are
A:	and it is a smaller size
A:	and, uh, I do feel like there are a lot of options.
A:	It's, it's,
A:	but I had been hoping some schools I know give, uh, oh,
A:	even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, uh,
B:	What, what does,
B:	he hopes to be a writer.
A:	Yes,
A:	he thinks that's what he'd like to do,
A:	but he's really strong in math and science, too,
A:	and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind.
B:	Huh.
A:	Does your daughter know what she'd like to do?
B:	Oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in all directions.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is
B:	okay Bethany, let's be real
B:	Uh, she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point.
B:	And, I don't know,
B:	she's taken a lot of French,
B:	and she may end up doing something with that.
B:	And I am a single mom,
B:	so I've been,
B:	and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married.
B:	So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.
B:	And I'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money. You know.
A:	Yes.
B:	I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	By all means, go get that piece of paper, you know.
B:	Do you just have one son?
A:	Yes.
B:	I see.
B:	Well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants to do.
A:	Well, he, but he has even,
A:	now that he's in high school, uh,
A:	and, of course, there's, there is still time,
A:	but he's beginning to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.
A:	You know, it's, the, it's,
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess we're supposed to discuss the, uh, school system.
A:	That shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us. Right?
B:	No.
B:	As many years as we've been involved in one.
B:	I really feel fortunate in that there, even though there are problems,
B:	they're not a lot of problems where I teach.
A:	Right.
B:	But from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, uh, with dropouts.
B:	Uh, when I was in Minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that, uh, on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and sometimes they didn't even show up for class
B:	and she taught in high school in inner city, uh, Minneapolis.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they just didn't come to school.
A:	That's really sad isn't it?
B:	And I cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school.
A:	Right.
A:	Well just recently in the paper here, were articles about students, uh, working. High school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But then the follow-up the next day was,
A:	I was kind of glad to see,
A:	because it, it said that, you know,
A:	yes
A:	but for those students who are determined to do well anyway, that, you know, handling a job was very possible. You know, and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors.
B:	I think so too.
A:	You know like, what are their plans after high school, you know.
A:	And what's their home situation.
A:	You know that,
B:	The home is the key.
A:	Right. Right.
B:	I think really is because if the home, does not place a high priority on education
B:	and, uh, the main goal is making money now
B:	and it may be a survival thing  for the family, which you can understand.
A:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	So, uh,
A:	But there can still be an attitude of
B:	Right.
A:	you know, this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now,
A:	but, but that the most important thing is still, you know  getting your education.
B:	Your education.
A:	Well when they meant, said the, the topic, you know, of what's wrong with the public schools, my, my first impulse was it isn't really what's wrong with the public, public schools.
A:	It's what's wrong with families
B:	That's right.
B:	It's what's wrong with families
B:	and if, if children come to school, yes, insecure and their biggest concern is survival both at home,
A:	Right.
B:	they don't know what to expect at home.
B:	They don't feel secure there,
B:	they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex.
A:	Right.
B:	For example that child that was shot.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, how can they concentrate on schooling?
B:	I agree  with you,
A:	Right.
B:	I think that's the main problem.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And schools now are supposed to solve social problems, uh, mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that's overwhelming.
A:	Well we've got, uh, you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
A:	and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor.
A:	And that's just really not enough.
B:	No.
B:	It isn't.
A:	And I was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school
A:	and they said, oh, but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are, you know, at a tougher and rougher age and all that.
A:	But, you know, part of my feeling is that if you solve, help them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there.
B:	True.
B:	I think they, there has to be at least a counselor
B:	and we just recently had a counselor at elementary.
B:	We didn't even have counselors in elementary.
A:	Really.
B:	We have always, though, had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids
B:	and they divided them up between three counselors
B:	but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor
B:	and they decided that didn't work.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So they started, uh, dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees  through  you know, through all three years of middle school.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They  they do that here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If they have a rapport with their counselor.
B:	Now if they don't, I hope they have the flexibility to be able to change  a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them.
A:	yeah.
B:	And occasionally that happens.
A:	Right.
B:	But, it is frightening Because, uh, education is the key to our future
A:	Yes,
A:	it certainly is.
B:	and, uh, if we have children who are not getting their education, for one reason or another, then what are we going to do with them?
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right
B:	What's going to happen to them?
B:	Are they going to be able to, uh, work at other kind of menial jobs
B:	or are they going to be the thieves and the people  in prison.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them.
A:	Right.
B:	That's no good.
A:	I'm on that, um, campus strategic planning committee for my school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh,
A:	they have all these different names for things, strategies and all these different things.
A:	But, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value.
A:	Then I think they decided to strike economic.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Anyway, you know, the point was, what happens when public education fails?
A:	You know  will then people go to private schools?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, well, what kind of a situation do they get there
A:	and what are, you know,
A:	and what kind of state are we in if, if most people are going to private schools.
B:	Well I think, uh, one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody.
A:	Right.
B:	There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try to educate everyone.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's one of the things that we do.
B:	We try to educate everyone.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	We're the only country in the world that does.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing, you know, to work  and have, uh, some ability.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah.
B:	They can do that.
A:	and one of the Plano school district's, you know, goals is that they will graduate every child that, uh, that is here in the ninth grade,
A:	I believe  it's something like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's worded.
A:	And, uh, I don't know
B:	Well you know if we can keep them in school.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	That's  so important,
B:	then that, that helps a lot.
B:	I think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too.
A:	Oh gosh.
A:	Well that new movie,  That new movie out,
B:	It's scary to me.
A:	I, um,
A:	really, really a frightening situation.
B:	I, We are.
A:	I guess we're both lucky. To be in situations and schools where we don't see that.
A:	My folks talk about it a lot in Illinois.
A:	My mother was is was teacher for years and years
A:	and, uh, they live in Peoria, Illinois,
A:	and they're talking a lot about the, you know, the school situation there, too. *their should be they're
A:	So, well, shall we wrap it up?
B:	Uh, I would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary.
A:	I think we have to.
B:	Okay.
A:	So I'll see you when we see you.
B:	Alright.
B:	We were in, uh, Austin yesterday.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The reason that I wasn't at church
A:	and we went to hear, uh, James wind ensemble concert
B:	Oh.
A:	they left this morning for, uh, England.
B:	Oh, how exciting.
A:	Isn't that wonderful?
B:	Oh, that is wonderful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What an experience.
A:	And, uh, the university ...
A:	Okay.
B:	Hi, Nancy.
B:	Well, do you do a lot of dining out?
A:	No, um,
A:	we don't although we enjoy it.
A:	Um, we do it more when we have company come.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, what about you?
B:	Well, we do some dining out.
B:	Um, I, I do a lot of cooking
B:	so, um, mostly like when we go out, you know, it's my husband and I,
B:	I, we don't go out too often as a family, um, unless it's like a fast-food kind of thing.
B:	But, um, but we do enjoy dining out.
B:	One of our favorite places here in, in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe.
B:	I don't know if you, have you ever been there?
A:	I've heard of that
A:	but I haven't been there.
A:	Um, where, about is that?
B:	Um, well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and, uh,
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	I, I've been to Cafe Pacific.
B:	Have you?
B:	now that's down in, uh, Highland Park.
A:	Right.
B:	It's Highland Park Village.
B:	Did you like it?
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh
B:	Oh, I love it
A:	Before we moved to, the area, my brother, uh, lived in Dallas for a number of years
A:	and we came up one time when my father was visiting
A:	and we all ate there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, oh, their seafood was wonderful.
B:	Oh, it is, it's fabulous.
B:	It really is a great place.
A:	Now where is the Atlantic Cafe?
B:	Atlantic Cafe is down on, I believe it's on McKinney.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Um, and originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
B:	And then they, they separated
B:	and the guy started Cafe Pacific.
B:	And, I loved them both.
B:	I really do.
B:	I think they're wonderful.
B:	That's our favorite.
B:	You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's.
B:	Have you been there?
A:	No, um,
A:	but I've heard that's really good, too,
A:	and,
B:	It's wonderful.
B:	The only thing is you have to wait.
B:	You have, you have to expect to wait at least an hour.
A:	Oh.
B:	So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.
B:	And, as long as you know that it's okay.
B:	But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib um, anywhere in the area.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I love it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, my husband really likes their ribs.
B:	So it's hysterical.
B:	We go in
B:	and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
B:	and then we get there
B:	and we don't even look at the menu .
A:	You know right away what you want
B:	I know right away what we, what we want.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too,
A:	and, uh, actually the, the Steak And Ale out here, uh, we've gone to, uh,
A:	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've  had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday night
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, the time we went the prime rib was really good.
B:	Was it?
B:	Really?
B:	I've I've, I've been there for like, you know, lunch
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I've never been there for dinner.
B:	And, it was good,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	Oh, that's great.
B:	That's, great.
B:	Another nice place for, for prime rib is Baby Doe's
A:	Oh, I've heard about that, too
B:	Maxwell's nice,
B:	have you been there?
A:	but no.
A:	We've, uh, I guess we eat out even less than I realize
B:	And I didn't think we ate out very often
B:	See!
B:	Baby Doe's is nice.
A:	Oh
B:	And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, uh, is Lawry's.
B:	I've heard that's real good,  Lawry's Prime Rib?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	I'd, I had heard that, too. Um,
B:	I've, I've never been there
B:	but I've heard it's real good.
A:	Have you been to the little, uh, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, um, right here  on Central Expressway? *slash error Oh, okay. *slash error should be bk
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes,
B:	actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to.
B:	Uh, they have real nice lunches.
B:	Have you, have you been there for lunch?
B:	Or,
A:	Yes, uh
B:	Yeah.
A:	primarily lunch, well, and breakfast sometimes
A:	but, uh, during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, uh, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included  the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
B:	Really?
B:	Really?
A:	and, uh, the,
A:	my husband and I like veal, uh  a lot
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and their veal dishes have been good.
A:	We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the
B:	The specials.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you ever been to Biffin's?
B:	I keep hearing about it.
B:	I keep hearing the advertisements of it
A:	I,
A:	yes,
A:	no,
B:	and, and they keep saying, you know, oh, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
B:	I have not been over there
B:	and I was thinking, you know, it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl.
A:	Right.
A:	And,
B:	And, uh, I've, I've not been there.
A:	I haven't either, uh,
A:	one place,
A:	and I've only been there for lunch,
A:	but, uh, I went with a friend,
A:	and we met her husband, um, down on Greenville,
A:	down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,
B:	I've been there.
A:	Oh, I, we just
B:	That was nice
A:	It was
A:	and we had the, uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup
A:	and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
A:	and they did.
A:	It was wonderful
A:	but, uh, and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert  which was a chocolate sack.
A:	I don't know if you tried
A:	but  or
B:	Oh
B:	I've heard of it.
B:	Where, where it's made,
B:	it's like, it's like a,
B:	it's all chocolate, like made like a paper bag
A:	Yes!  and whip cream
B:	and it's filled with what, whip cream  and, and strawberries and something?
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries in a raspberry, uh, puree
B:	Oh.
A:	and, and we shared one, the three of us
B:	Oh.
A:	and it was plenty because it was very rich
A:	but, uh I wished I'd had a camera.
B:	Oh.
A:	It was beautiful
B:	Oh, I bet it was.
B:	I bet it was.
A:	Uh
B:	The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day,
B:	and we took another friend with us
A:	Oh.
B:	and, uh, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves
B:	And so we had, they had, uh, like a berry assortment.
B:	It was, it was raspberries and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the,
B:	you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah
A:	Oh.
B:	and it was outstanding.
A:	It sounds wonderful.
B:	It was really, really relatively simple
B:	but, oh, it was good.
B:	It was really good.
A:	Well, that's, uh, one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.
A:	Uh, I love fresh berries.
A:	And, their, their fruits are always exceptional.
A:	I don't, I'm, know
A:	they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,  you can't find them like that
B:	You can't find them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You know, I'm originally from Connecticut
B:	and, uh, I was home a few years ago
B:	and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner
B:	and, uh, I was really amazed, you know,
B:	the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.
B:	You know, they were real, real pretty
B:	but they lacked, the service
B:	and they lacked the the, just the, I don't know.
B:	The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh,
B:	I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, I thought I would really miss that.
A:	I would, too,
A:	because, well, because we don't go out very often.
A:	When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,
A:	and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience.
A:	Of course you want the food to be good
A:	but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.
A:	Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track
A:	but it is wonderful.
A:	It's called Cafe Max
A:	and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.
A:	They have the most wonderful salads.
A:	They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Well, my favorite type of music is classical music,
A:	and, uh, I, I enjoy orchestral classical music
A:	and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano, you know,
A:	and that's, those are, that's my favorite type.
B:	Well,
A:	Uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.
B:	Oh, well my favorite, well,
B:	I, I don't really have a favorite,
B:	I, I like everything basically.
B:	Um, I guess if I had to pick, it would be like pop, I would think,
B:	but I like everything.
B:	So, it's kind of hard to choose sometimes.
A:	Yeah, you know.
A:	I guess I enjoy, I enjoy jazz, listening to jazz sometime although I don't feel like I have a good, good understanding of it, or a good, a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not,
A:	but, but, um, I enjoy it
A:	and, uh, sometimes I enjoy listening to, uh, fiddle music.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We were in Colorado recently
A:	and heard this, these, uh, well, we heard this fiddler
A:	and we bought his, we bought his tape
A:	and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans .
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	I grew up next door to, uh, the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader
B:	so,
A:	Oh, Chris Xeros.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, you lucky thing.
B:	So, we used to go and listen to them all the time
B:	and, my parents still do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and, and what not.
B:	Plus my parents are, well,
B:	especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music
B:	and he introduced my brother and I both, to a lot of it.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	Chris Xeros
A:	You grew up with his children, too, then?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	Sure did.
A:	Gosh,
A:	small world, huh?
B:	Yeah.
B:	We all went to high school together
B:	and, uh, and we're still in contact with each other.
A:	Oh.
B:	We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not
B:	so,
A:	Oh gosh.
A:	Well actually, I used to play in the Richardson Symphony,
A:	I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know,
B:	Oh really?
A:	yeah
A:	So,
B:	It is a small world isn't it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	small world.
A:	So, I, uh, I know Chris
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's a pretty nice guy.
A:	Most of the time
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I never I had to work for him
B:	and I never would want to work for him.
B:	So
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	Well life just took different turns here
A:	so, uh, it just didn't work out to do that now.
A:	And, um,
A:	Okay.
A:	So how do you just figure ,
B:	Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,
B:	today was a beautiful day
B:	it was like, uh, uh, summer day.
B:	It was seventy degrees
B:	so so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt,
A:	Wow.
B:	it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews
B:	and so I had to dress up anyway
B:	and then I wore heels, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots you know.
A:	Oh.
B:	So how do you dress?
A:	Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it
A:	and I wore heels anyway
B:	Yeah.
A:	And,
B:	I, I can see,
B:	I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter
B:	and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,  it was tiring.
A:	I know,
A:	it might kill you to go up and  walk up to the door
B:	That's right.
A:	but you're going to look nice for the kids
B:	That's right
B:	and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?
A:	Oh, oh, yeah.
A:	Well, I need all the height I can get
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do too.
B:	So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades,  uh, older grades, I had to wear heels.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we too. Um,
A:	if it was it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots
A:	but then I would change, um, into heels,  as soon as I got to my desk.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, um,
B:	Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know,
B:	it has a heel on it.
B:	They're the kind of boots that I wear to work
B:	and we wear them, you know,
B:	they're a leather boot that you wear
B:	and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.
A:	Oh.
B:	And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.
B:	Uh, it's kind of a,
B:	I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots.
B:	They're not a cowboy boot,
B:	but they're just a real pretty boot,
B:	but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.
A:	Oh.
B:	As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Huh. Well, um,
B:	Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.
A:	Yeah, um,
A:	the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it
A:	So I did,
B:	Oh, my goodness
B:	so then you had to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then the third year we, um, got heating
A:	so it was nice
B:	Yes.
B:	Then things improved, right?
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know,
A:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	and, uh, that's very seldom
B:	we, it depends upon our winter.
B:	We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know,
B:	but most of the time you can wear a sweater
B:	and we just don't wear coats much.
B:	We often laugh about even when it turns chilly.
B:	We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh. Nice.
A:	Well
B:	It's really different.
B:	Let's put it that way.
B:	Are you not teaching anymore?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	we, we moved to Iowa
A:	and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.
B:	I see.
A:	And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.
B:	Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I wear, uh, tennis shoes,  and jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	More practical.
A:	not,
A:	yes,
A:	it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.
B:	When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual
B:	Yeah, well,
A:	For,
B:	I know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,
B:	and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really.
B:	It's all right for the students,
B:	they look tacky a lot
B:	but I didn't think teachers should, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's how I feel too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?
A:	Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it
A:	but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,
B:	Where did you live before?
A:	Um, we lived in Utah before
A:	and, and I grew up in California.
B:	Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,
A:	Well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music?
B:	Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.
A:	Oh, same here.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What type of music do you like in the classical area,
B:	or what era do you, era do you like the most?
A:	Oh, well, I guess I like a wide range. Uh, everything from, uh, from Baroque through at least some modern music.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my wife and I these days are especially into opera.
A:	We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now.
B:	Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages?
A:	Well, we, uh, generally,
A:	the places we've gone they sing in the original languages.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, uh, if I don't know the story line and, um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on.
A:	Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, uh, you, you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video uh, video tape
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we have quite a collection of those,
A:	and you watch them at home,
A:	and they have subtitles,
A:	so you, you figure out what's going on after a while,
A:	and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, you know, the, uh, Dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all their performances I think.
B:	What is that?
A:	Well, they, they give an, uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.
B:	Oh, I didn't know that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That can help people like me.
A:	In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.
B:	Well, I can understand that.
B:	So, I'd say, Vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I really like Vivaldi.
A:	Uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I like Baroque music,
B:	I like full body music, uh, with the, um, um, with brass and winds, woodwinds, instruments, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Course I like, uh, also string instruments,
B:	and I have two string instruments in my house. Uh, instrument players,
B:	both my sons play string instruments.
B:	One plays the cello
B:	and the other one plays the viola.
A:	Oh
B:	So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	How, how old are they?
B:	One is thirteen and one is eleven.
A:	So they're doing this in school, or what?
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes .
A:	Well, you've got half a string quartet there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We're on our way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, um, I try to enjoy all of it.
A:	Well, since you seem to like, uh, Italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess?
B:	Um, a little bit,
B:	but, um, a lot of the, um, music I don't know about, uh, as far as the titles,
B:	and I have to listen to it, and and figure out, what I'm listening to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Do you belong to that?
A:	No,
A:	I don't,
A:	but I think I know what it is.
A:	Isn't that a, uh, uh, see,
A:	can't you get records through that or something, recordings?
B:	You can get recordings.
B:	Uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, uh, or cassettes or L P
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves.
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think, uh.
B:	But they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess,
B:	what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the the conductors.
A:	Uh.
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	right
B:	Yeah.
B:	They go to conductors, uh,
B:	and, and they actually have them perform the music,
B:	and they record it.
A:	So, they're actually commissioned performances.
B:	Sure.
B:	A lot of them are.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or they will find out when they're performing,
B:	and they will, uh, record the music at that time.
B:	And so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music,
B:	and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section,
B:	and they also have a, uh, more contemporary and American uh, composer section.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I had heard good things about the, uh, Music Heritage Society,
A:	but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on on music.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you can control it.
A:	I almost, uh, almost, uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my roommate signed me up.
A:	He got a bonus record,
A:	and I got a lot of bills
B:	I see.
A:	So we have to watch that.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Uh, do you play any instrument yourself?
B:	Yes,
B:	I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone.
A:	How do you feel about the Viet Nam war?
B:	Huh, well, um, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh,
B:	I just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I saw that as well.
B:	Got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.
B:	I really appreciated the, the whole, uh, English class where the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know,
B:	the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out,
B:	what are you going to do?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, what for him to finish me off
B:	And, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of Asian philosophy  that, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, were  you ever in Viet Nam
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	I was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number,
B:	and you?
A:	Um, I was much too young,
A:	I was born in sixty-seven,
A:	so.
B:	Oh
A:	Um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age,
A:	but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.
B:	Well, I, personally, uh, you know, uh, I just went in limbo.
B:	I had a passport and was ready to go or um, out of the country or join special forces, either one.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I just didn't know.
B:	So, uh.
A:	Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	just a second.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	Sure,
B:	now. Well, Mark, um, what was that again?
A:	Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our the investment in lives and money was worth it?
B:	No,
B:	not, not really.
A:	I totally agree with that. Um.
B:	Um.
A:	What, what effects do you think it's had on our country?
B:	Downside. Um, uh, well,
B:	the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there
B:	and, you know, presidents have always avoided that as a country.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's pretty serious, really, you know,
B:	lot of things that aren't being addressed.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,
A:	it it wasn't, you know, it was never
A:	we, we announced that we were going to war,
A:	it was such a gradual and subtle, you know um, you know increasement of, of force that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Gulf of Tonkin, uh, resolution
B:	and was it a dolphin or a torpedo.
B:	You remember that?
A:	I vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	only only it was foggy
B:	and finally President Johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.
A:	Oh
B:	Isn't that something?
A:	Uh-huh. Um,
A:	so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hey Mark I've got to go, um.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
B:	We'll see you.
B:	I guess our five minutes are up according to me.
B:	Are they to you?
A:	Uh, I wasn't really keeping count.
A:	But I guess,
A:	good-bye.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	So, uh, Mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury?
B:	Well I work for an insurance company
B:	so I see a lot of, uh, verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. Um, by juries particularly,
B:	and I know in England the judges set all of the awards.
B:	You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence,
B:	but then they leave the awards up to more learned people.
B:	And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, that seems to make sense
A:	but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, uh, kind of the rate for different .
B:	Oh, exactly.
B:	Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	When you get one way out like that
B:	but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after.
B:	Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, they're not going to sit there and lose money.
B:	If they are losing money, then they're going to raise rates.
A:	Right.
A:	they
B:	So it all comes filtering down to us all individually.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged,  you know.
A:	Well,  how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb.
A:	Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?
B:	I don't know.
B:	You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it pre specified in the policy so much
B:	but I don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value on somebody's limb,  uh, arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with, with that.
B:	I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old.
A:	Huh.
B:	I, I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there.
B:	And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that can be part of continuing education, maybe for judges
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, to get into the economics of things, uh,
B:	because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards,  it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	If it's a company, you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages,
A:	Huh.
B:	I think those should be uninsurable.
B:	I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that,  that did the damage.
A:	Oh, out of
A:	As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, we're,  Who, who
B:	For, for honest mistakes where they've done something and, and something happens.
B:	One of their employees causes damage or something.
B:	Sure. That's what they buy insurance for.
A:	do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies
A:	or how does that work?
B:	Well, I was just talking about any company.
B:	Uh,  let's just say a lumber manufacturing company
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	your talking about
B:	and,  uh, somebody is on the premises
A:	Sure.
B:	and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift
B:	and he pushes the wrong button
B:	and he drops a load of lumber on somebody
B:	and it injures,  them.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well,
B:	Sure.
B:	Insurance should pay for that.
A:	But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
B:	Well I'm not talking about any loss.
B:	I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due.
B:	And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less.
B:	But it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their,  negligence.   For gross wanton negligence in a claim.
A:	That,
A:	For, oh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And unfortunately the the,
B:	lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So again, it never really penalizes,  the company doing the wrong.
A:	Right.
A:	That will,
B:	They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.
A:	Huh.
B:	And if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know,
B:	I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences,
B:	I'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know,
B:	maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there
B:	and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.
A:	Sure.
A:	Okay.
B:	Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
A:	Go ahead
B:	Oh, okay
B:	Yeah,
B:	the, uh, subject is child care and how to determine child care,
B:	and that's, uh, an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children,
B:	but I did run a child care facility for a while.
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, have some,
A:	Well, you should, you should have some opinions on that, then.
B:	I do have some thoughts on that,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, it's, uh, an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for, or parent for a lot of people there,
B:	and, uh, it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities
A:	Well, I guess if I were going to choose, I mean, my first consideration would be safety.
B:	Right.
A:	My second consideration would be, uh, uh, health.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I guess my third consideration would be, uh, warm, environment, warm personal environment.
B:	Well, right.
B:	Uh, in Texas, we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a, at an institutional level and at a, like a small home level
B:	so you meet the standards,
B:	but then after that there's, there's a lot more.
B:	I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff, is qualification of people who work there, and in hiring people who would work at the, uh, day care, the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people, uh, in terms of, not just, just
B:	because somebody has a child or, uh, likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that that, uh,
A:	Oh, absolutely
A:	As a matter of fact, I believe that the safety and, and health, uh, issues, uh, depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children.
B:	Exactly.
B:	And that was the most difficult thing of all, to find the, the right people, the qualified people.
A:	And it's the most difficult of all for a parent, judge, uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving,
B:	Oh,
A:	but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are,
B:	Oh, exactly.
B:	And the other thing that's difficult in, uh, it's a too small setting, like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child, because you don't want to just warehouse the child,
B:	and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case, where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four, five years or so important
B:	and you have to have the right kind of enrichment
B:	and that, that includes, uh, an atmosphere in which the child is safe and, and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for,
B:	but also his, uh, developmental needs are cared for, too.
A:	Maybe the right thing to do is to, uh, when a couple has a child, then they should both take, you say the first four or five years are the most important, and I think I would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.
B:	That would be lovely.
A:	Get rid of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the age of six.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then uh, and then, of course, to make up for that, uh, the, uh, parents would have to work in their later years longer, you know,
A:	in other words, they probably would not work, may not, may end up not working at all in the twenties. Uh,
B:	Well, that's an interesting thought because,
A:	But then they have to work from age thirty or, or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety.
B:	That would be okay
B:	That would, that would help on the other end, too, in, in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be.
A:	Right,
A:	well, you know, the, uh, uh, the world is changing uh, from from, uh, industrial, uh, base to, uh, information base
A:	and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's exactly right.
A:	All you have to do is have a sharp mind,
A:	and I believe that, uh, mental acuity is easy to sustain, maintain, if you just simply continue to exercise your mind.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I think a person could work, uh, into the seventies, eighties, even nineties for that matter,
A:	if they didn't have to do a lot of physical, uh, labor, they could maintain, uh,
A:	Your turn.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, I don't think they should abolish it
B:	I think, I think if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got.
A:	But not for petty theft?
B:	Right.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	For major things like premeditated murder. Mass murders. Uh, you know, that type of thing.
B:	I don't think it should just be used loosely.
A:	Well, it should be used as a deterrent do you think?
B:	Well,
A:	Or should it be used, uh,
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
B:	To prevent these people from ever getting out on the street. By, you know, some technicality.
B:	And they go down the line ten years
B:	and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, that's about the only thing.
B:	Like for petty, for theft and, and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know,
B:	I don't think they should do that.
A:	Well, you know, there's this old, uh, Jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
B:	Oh, well, I guess,  if I, if it was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way.
B:	You know, I've never had anybody in my immediate family, uh, murdered
B:	and so I really wouldn't know.
B:	But, but I feel like if I did, I probably would feel that way.
A:	Well, one of the things I was thinking about is, uh, you know, from society's point of view, if you put a value on each person, what you want to do is to maximize the end game value.
A:	So if you have someone that, that destroys that value uh, then what you want to take steps to, uh, minimize the loss.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, you have to also put value on the criminal.
B:	Right.
A:	So if you terminate him, that's a loss of value.
B:	Well, that's true
A:	So, you know, if you weight everyone equally, then you have to say, well the likelihood of not terminating him,
A:	if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person.
A:	In other words, you'd have to, you'd have to murder more than one other person uh, in order to justify taking his life.
B:	Besides him.
B:	Okay.
A:	Another way you could do it is weight this value by, uh, the value to society of the people. Uh, which is pretty delicate thing to do.
A:	But one way of doing it is, uh, by income.
A:	So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money, which is often times the case, then  then he's obviously not worth very much
B:	His life isn't worth very much then
A:	and so, uh, the likelihood that, you know, maybe expected, expected murders by him is, is, uh, integrated over the income of the people, uh, that he murders is maybe, you know, a loss of, who knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.
A:	Uh, but if he only, uh, integrated, you know, integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is, uh, small, less than eight hundred thousand dollars, then you terminate him
A:	Of course, one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm, is you find that it's more easy, it's easier to, uh, to, uh, terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means, well
B:	Right.
A:	I suppose you could say, well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation.
B:	Potential.
B:	I mean that's, that's the key right there. Potential.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now, are they, are they rehabilitative or, or not.
A:	Now that's all fine and well and, and, uh, good philosophical.
A:	But if you're involved yourself, personally
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I know I have a friend whose, uh, son was murdered, uh, on the night before his sixteenth birthday.
A:	And let me tell you, uh, I, I knew them personally, uh, not intimately, but quite well
A:	and, uh, you're talking about real trauma. I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies.
B:	I can imagine.
A:	The father, you know,
A:	of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get, I think, in terms of psychological impact.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, and,
B:	Was he murdered?
B:	Did they find who killed him?
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	They found him
A:	and he is on trial for capital murder.
B:	So it hasn't been a long time ago.
B:	Just recently.
A:	Uh, well, actually he has, I, I'm sorry. He was convicted, uh,
A:	and, of course, now, you know, and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process
A:	but
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	That appeals process, I mean, it's what, you know, really, you know, just drags out and out and out.
B:	My brother-in-law here in Texas, his, by marriage, my sister's, uh, husband, his sister was murdered down here by a guy in, in, well actually in Houston
B:	and, uh, he,
B:	Okay.
B:	Go ahead.
A:	Uh, well, you know, uh, I think public service is a worthy thing
A:	and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs, uh, such as Peace Corps that promote that.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Probably the most popular one but, uh, one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts.
B:	Huh
A:	Uh, I know that because my son is a, a scout now and, uh, is thinking about his Eagle
A:	and, uh, in order to get Eagle, you have to have merit badges in, uh, citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world
B:	Right .
A:	and you have to do a public service project. Uh, in which leadership is the key element.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, uh, I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because, uh, it's talking about a requirement for public service
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, of course, the Peace Corps, the Boy Scouts is a, is a voluntary activity.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh,
B:	I, I think that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.
B:	Either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.
A:	Right,
A:	of course, uh, uh, military service falls under the category, uh, of a public service.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	And, so, uh, one of the things that would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.
B:	Huh . Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh,
A:	but I agree with you, that probably is not what was comprehended.
A:	There are other  things such as civil service uh, which many people, uh, are lifelong employees of
B:	Well,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either.
A:	More  of a voluntary kind of thing
B:	Yeah.
A:	or, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	for, for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative, uh, public service for, uh, young people to go into, uh, after high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, kind of in lieu of the draft for, for people who don't, uh, who, you know, are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military, you know.
B:	Say, okay,
B:	well you can go into the military
B:	or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and, and learn about things.
B:	And it's interesting because I, I'm not a particular fan of the military
B:	but I have seen a lot of people, a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined, you know, even just personal discipline about what they want to do
B:	and they come out
B:	and they, they at least have, now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline.
B:	And they have, uh, you know, in, in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say, they can see that, you know, if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever, at least for a short period of time, I can accomplish a lot
B:	and it, it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn. That they don't need to be, you know, cowboys.
B:	They don't need to be out there and, uh, you know, constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished.
B:	And, you know, for some, for some young men, that's good.
B:	For me, it would have been lousy idea, uh, because  I, I did have the personal discipline.
A:	Why?
B:	And I went  to college for four years and got out, you know,
A:	Why is that?
B:	so. But, uh, you know, for some people that's good.
B:	I, I don't particular like the fact that it's the military, you know,
B:	and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially. As, as an instrument of U S policy.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	no,
A:	no.
A:	It's to defend the nation against external evils.
B:	Well, that's one view
B:	And, and, you know, and that, that's another debate.
B:	But, uh, it's, uh,
A:	Well, it depends on whether you, whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive, aggression oriented military.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right
B:	and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggressive oriented,
B:	I mean, you, you look at the last military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States
B:	and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe,
B:	so, at, at any rate, this is getting off the topic
B:	but
B:	my, my point was that there is, for people who don't want to do the military service, there, it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and, uh, sense of community that the Boy Scouts,
A:	Actually, I've been involved in electronics a long time. Uh, in computers
A:	and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Uh, up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	I got one for my son. A, a Macintosh uh, L C.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's a real easy to use color, uh, computer
A:	and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it
A:	and he uses it for his school work.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I've, I'm currently in school
B:	so I, I've had an I B M clone, I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually upgrading I guess.
B:	And, uh, I've found, I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it
B:	and I can't really,
B:	I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,
B:	so
A:	Huh.
B:	it, it's very essential for me.
B:	Schools have them,
B:	uh, but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school.
B:	It's very easy, it's much more convenient to have one at home.
A:	Where you going to school?
B:	At Georgia Tech.
A:	I see.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so.
A:	In engineering?
B:	Yes, actually.
A:	So that explains all the, uh, computer assignments.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, uh,
A:	Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work?
B:	Um, sure.
B:	I have some games, of course, which I play on there
B:	and, uh, uh, I have a program which allows me to access a, uh, weather data bank
B:	so I can, like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby.
B:	So, it provides other means other than just strict, uh, you know, computations and so on,
B:	so. Have you, do you have a computer for yourself at home?
A:	No.
A:	No,
A:	I just have one for my son
A:	and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for  home computing.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	At at work, uh, I'm a technologist, uh,
A:	and I, in the past, have done a great deal of, of, uh, system development just through, uh, software development programming.
A:	Uh, but now I find myself using the computer,
A:	even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system and a communication system.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Do you use Email and like that?
A:	Yes.
A:	Emil is, probably pulls down a third of all my time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's,
B:	I, I, uh, I have modem night computer
B:	so I can log into the the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which is, which can be useful.
B:	But, uh, yeah
B:	that's, that and word processing is
B:	while I tend to,
B:	I mean, obviously, I do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's, it's really become, I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess.
B:	I can't even remember,
B:	actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in, in my life to do a, a to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high,
B:	so
A:	Huh. Well I'm a old-timer.
A:	I did my Master's thesis on, uh, a typewriter.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh, I rented an I B M Selectric.
B:	Oh.
A:	And it was a pretty big deal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It must have been tough.
B:	It's a little bit strange for me.
B:	I, I did my Master's thesis, uh, last year
B:	and I did that on a computer
B:	and it seems like,
B:	I just can't imagine how people did it before.
B:	It must have been just so much, so much work
A:	Yeah.
A:	It, uh, well, you know, it's just, it was just a completely different world then.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, so you used your son's Macintosh then?
B:	Do you, do you find it, do you like that kind of computer?
A:	I like it,
A:	yeah.
A:	I like it from a distance really.
A:	I, I see the packages on it, uh, that are available
A:	and it's nice.
A:	I really don't use it myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I, when I come home from work, I, I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, so I let my son do it
A:	and, Uh, of course, you know, there's, uh, there's an intellectual evolution taking place where,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it's sort of a joke
A:	but it's really true,
A:	the old-timers, even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R and whatnot
A:	and the kids, they just take to it like candy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, if, if, if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge
A:	Regarding, uh, taxes. I, you know,
A:	taxes are really a necessary evil and, in a civilized society.
A:	But really, people get upset at taxes because you, it's more efficient to do things yourself.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, and so as, as a result, uh, you know, it's, it's a trade-off, you know, for the common good, you know. For, for the benefit of others, you know.
A:	How much of your resource should you dedicate to, uh, making things work for others?
A:	Have you, uh, you know, ever thought, you know, just how much of that money should, should go to other people that really don't deserve it?
B:	Uh, well yeah
B:	I know it's, it's a lot, you know that, uh, that I feel like, you know, just like you said, that, there's just so much that you can do yourself. That you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for
B:	but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either,
B:	but yet they accept it.
A:	Well, the thing of it is, if I wanted to just, uh, you know, permanently become a book reader, I guess I could just, uh, you know, uh, go on public assistance, uh, you know  look for, uh, look for people to, uh, take care of me.
B:	Like so many people do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, probably a good woman,
A:	right?
B:	Right
A:	Just, you know, just, just con somebody to take care of me.
A:	And then you don't have to be on the tax roll.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, but taxes are, are very difficult kind of thing
A:	and everybody really hates it.
A:	It was very timely.
A:	I, I, I always over pay my, my deductions
A:	so I wind up with my, getting money back on my, uh, from my, uh, withholding.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, you know, that, that's always a smile.
A:	But, of course, you know, I've, I've paid it in
A:	and I should calculate it better.
B:	Right
B:	You  are you in business for yourself?
A:	No.
A:	I, I, I work for the F B I.
A:	So I, I'm a federal employee.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Guess I don't sound like it huh?
B:	Uh, well, I
B:	no
B:	I think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as, as everybody else, you know.  Unless you work for Internal Revenue
A:	Yeah,
A:	I belong .
A:	Oh I, I've got all four feet in the trough, you know, being a federal employee.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and so, but, but I can understand that, uh, that, you know, the, uh, who gets benefits.
A:	Like every, every time there is a, a bond issue you know, I vote no on every one of them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I'm, I,
A:	but there,
A:	this is, this is, tax not tax revolt country.
A:	I mean there's too many,
A:	every one of us, most of us have our, have all four feet in the trough, you know. Plus our snout, right up to our ears.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you know, it's not exactly that kind of a place that, that you want to, you know, get into a tax revolt situation.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, uh, the, uh, the local taxes here, I, I,
A:	in this particular area, uh, you know, I've, uh, I think I pay about, uh, oh thirty-five hundred for, for taxes on my four bedroom house, you know. And which is a lot of money.
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, and so as, as people get older and older, uh, you know, they think about retirement and that sort of thing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and they, they're building old people's homes, uh, you know, at tax expense.
A:	Well I think, you know, the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper.
A:	At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes,
A:	why I, I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a, rent a house for that,
A:	right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	You know. In, in, instead, it's, it's the taxes here
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not, you know or Seguin or someplace like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer.
A:	And, and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer.
A:	If you're not going to use them, then you want to be in, in environment.
A:	That's a strategy I think that the people have to, have to take. Is, is how to be able to, to lessen their cost of living. You know,
A:	I'm, I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire
A:	and, and I'm saying well, you know, I really can't stay here, uh, as a retiree.
B:	After you retire,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's too expensive.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm going to have go out and, you know, in, you know, East Fork someplace. And, and, do my thing, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	My parents are in the same situation, you know.
B:	They, their home is paid for
B:	but still their taxes are so high, that, you know, my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes.
B:	And they have no children in school or, you know, anything now.
B:	They don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards.
A:	Right.
A:	They, they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five, you know.
B:	Uh, yeah.
A:	And they're not doing it again, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. Well, it's certainly, uh, uh,
A:	you must be a T I employee.
B:	You must be what?
A:	You must be a T I employee?
B:	No,
B:	I'm not
A:	You're not a T I,
A:	who do you work for?
B:	I, I don't work.
B:	I'm a student.
B:	I go to school.
B:	I'm in nursing school
A:	You, you're,
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, generally I get, uh, you know, most of my news, uh, in the, you know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, and, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With, with occasional smatterings of, of, uh, you know, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, my, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to, to look at the articles every day and, and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the details.
A:	So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.
B:	Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like?
A:	Well, yes.
A:	I, I, well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and so I, I, I like the weekly magazines, uh, because it gives me, you know, the high points of what's going on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but many times, uh, you know, the, the local, uh, the local news kind of suffers, you know.
A:	But here I am, you know, cheek by jowl with our nation's capital
A:	and,
B:	Oh, that's right.
B:	You're very close actually.
B:	It's  almost a, uh, bedroom community for  the capital.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	exactly.
A:	Well, when, when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the beltway
A:	But, uh, it turns out that, uh, that, that the C N N is, I think, is great. And for, for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but generally, they're, they're, they're more sound bitish, you know, kind of thing
A:	and, and I don't really, uh, you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, uh, you know, dose of news that way.
B:	Yeah.
B:	A lot of my information comes from several sources.
B:	Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. Uh, which I like.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh, I, I think it's fairly objective
B:	and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative.
B:	And while there's an inherent, uh, filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read, uh, I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of, uh, favoring the other side.
B:	That's, that's potential indication of balance.
B:	And, generally, I really do believe they are pretty balanced.
B:	Uh, I also read TIME magazine
B:	and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the, uh, various, uh, of the articles and the front section
B:	and, uh,
A:	Well the MERCURY and the, and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really, can  stand up there.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, you
B:	did you use to live around here?
A:	Uh, Redwood City.
A:	I use to work at Anteks.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	okay.
B:	I know exactly where that is.
A:	Anteks, Amdahl and places like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper
A:	Yeah.
B:	the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times, at, well the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a, uh a very good quality uh, newspaper
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like a lot of the articles there.
B:	the other thing when you said, we don't have cable T V, so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is, is called C SPAN.
A:	Yes.
A:	I, I've, I enjoy,
A:	see they have, uh, we have two, the, both C SPANS here.
A:	But, but  really, the, on the public T V, you know, MACNEIL LEHRER is one, is an hour's program that I always,
B:	Both?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	if, if I watch any news program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And, and occasionally C SPAN.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I like a, I saw the, uh, the, uh, the, the tapes that were, that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust
A:	was, the whole thing was, was run on that
A:	and   and, and also, they have the, uh, the, uh, uh, PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD.
B:	Oh, I never say that. *listen: should "say" be "saw"?
B:	That would have been interesting.
A:	It,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I think that's always fascinating.
B:	I wish, I wish we had something.
A:	when, when it first, uh, you know, when it first tuned in on that I, you know,
A:	it's one that's,
A:	I think it was, somebody was just scarcely just, just ripping the hell out of another person.
A:	And I,
A:	and everybody was, you know, making noise in the background.
B:	But it's usually the Prime Minister,
B:	right?
A:	Here's this dude in a wig
B:	Thatcher,
B:	Major .
A:	and I said to myself, it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about
A:	And then, and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench
A:	and I said oh, it's Parliament
B:	Which could be another of Monty Python.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So I, I thought to myself, I can't wait.
A:	I'm going over to, to Britain in mid, you know, in mid-May.
A:	I, I, I'm going to, uh, you know, you know, approach my, uh, you know,
A:	this is how I discovered, you know, the the Prime Minister's, you know, question and answer period, you know.
B:	I, I have seen that
B:	and, uh, a, aside from the level of wit which is much higher than, generally, in American politics, uh, which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I think.
B:	And it's unlike the fairly controlled, uh, press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they, they always seem,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay, uh,
B:	my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE
B:	and it has been for a long time
B:	but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it.
B:	Do you by any chance?
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	You do!
A:	Yes,
A:	very much.
B:	Well, wouldn't you know
A:	As a matter of fact, I prefer public television.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I have, particularly enjoy the English comedies, and the English mysteries.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I watch mysteries too.
B:	Is that what you're referring to?
A:	Yes.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
B:	That is good.
B:	I like, uh,
B:	do you read?
A:	Vociferously.
B:	Okay,
B:	well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, the plots are more, um, challenging, you know, than the sitcoms of regular T V.
A:	Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the only access we have to that of course is public television.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect
A:	but, uh, the watching,
A:	what I do watch is, uh, usually news and whatever is on public television.
A:	Any kind of,
A:	I also uh, am very fond of great performances, in that regard.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
B:	Me too.
A:	But, uh
B:	Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF?
A:	No
B:	Oh, that was a scream.
A:	no,
A:	no
A:	as a matter of fact, uh, Turner Broadcasting, has been uh, broadcasting all of the James Bond movies, every night this week,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	Really.
A:	so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, this week
B:	I used to like him too,
B:	he was my hero.
B:	In fact, I like Sean Connery to this day.
A:	Well, they're showing uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	Oh, he can never cut it
A:	No,
A:	no
A:	that's true.
A:	I was just thinking that today, he did, well, in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate, in his early movies.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	he does.
A:	Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy look,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
B:	I liked his accent too.
B:	And, he can even be in movies that are not, uh, uh, sexually oriented,
B:	and he still comes off great.
A:	Well, you know he was, when was it, last year or year before last, he was voted the sexiest actor in movies, or something.
B:	He is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he had my vote double
A:	I mean the man is sixty-two years old.
B:	I don't care
A:	But, uh, but otherwise you know we,
A:	uh, with P B S and so forth.
A:	And I, I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but uh, the series, uh, YES MINISTER?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, what's that about?
A:	That was about a, the Interior Minister,
A:	it was a comedy,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	the Interior Minister of, in England, with the permanent secretary, and bureaucracy and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right,
B:	I, I've seen it several times.
B:	It's a scream,
B:	but I have to go to bed,
B:	I have to get up and, and work the next morning.
B:	I wish they'd put those,
B:	that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF.
B:	It came on after DOCTOR WHO, on Saturday nights, here at least.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it should,
B:	of course I
B:	really it was,
B:	I don't think they should show it during prime time,
B:	but still, it was funny.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
A:	Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher.
A:	I, I read as I said, and, uh, quite a bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What, what do you do?
A:	What kind of work do you do?
B:	I'm a Payroll Clerk.
B:	Just an accounting clerk.
A:	At T I?
B:	No, uh,
B:	I have a friend who works for T I
B:	and I work for a tire service, here in,
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	I'm from Dallas.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I
A:	and I just wondered.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it could be T I I think, probably are participating more than anybody else,
B:	but I needed the money.
B:	This is five bucks here.
A:	I think that's something we all
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
B:	Do you work for T I?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I work for G T E. In Maryland,
B:	Really?
A:	yes.
B:	How did you hear,
B:	oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we?
A:	I guess not.
A:	How did I hear about it?
A:	Well I work, you know,
A:	they are gathering a data base for voice processing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, that's my field of work also.
B:	Oh!
A:	So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this
A:	and I heard about it,
A:	so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, uh, You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth.
B:	Oh.
B:	Right.
A:	We could go back to television shows.
B:	Well, you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible?
A:	Yes,
A:	I have.
B:	I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true.
A:	Well, no.
A:	That's, uh,
A:	you could interpret it that way.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth,
A:	but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.
B:	Right.
A:	Okay,
A:	so you can have,
A:	there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing.
A:	So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that's, you know,
A:	you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true,
A:	but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You can look at it, you know,
A:	if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.
B:	I guess if you're looking for that, you're,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.
B:	that, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Really.
A:	But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, so, uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Surely we've made it.
A:	I think so too.
A:	Let's just,
A:	it's been very pleasant talking to you,
B:	It was very nice talking to you.
A:	and have a good evening.
B:	You too.
A:	Good night!
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, Robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution?
B:	Um, gee,
B:	I don't, I mean,
B:	I, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,
B:	they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.
A:	Right.
B:	So, I believe them
B:	but I'm not a chemist.
A:	Do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on?
B:	I don't really know, um,
B:	I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution.
A:	I was going to say,
A:	and, and you, so you understand smog
B:	I understand it very well
B:	and in fact I was a private pilot there,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I can remember very etched, etched clearly in my mind, uh, flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and, and really being unbelieving at, what looked like a, uh,
A:	Wow.
B:	it just looked liked peanut butter.
A:	My word.
B:	Thick and brown and so on.
A:	And that was, a few years ago?
B:	This was quite a few years ago.
B:	This was in the nineteen sixties.
A:	I, I wonder if it's any better now. Because they, uh, California has such strict rules, um, about emissions and so on.
B:	People say that it is somewhat better.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, I, I don't know if you heard about the, uh, recent legislation in, uh, Colorado, uh, against a power company, uh, that's actually on Indian land, I believe,
A:	but, uh, it has been ruled against, uh, regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon. And, um, particularly in the winter months.
B:	Um.
A:	So they,
A:	it was, uh, a landmark case because it's unusual to, um,
A:	I can,
A:	they, they were talking about shutting it down, or if it didn't comply and so on.
B:	So did it burn coal?
A:	I don't know that,
A:	the information is one of those wire services kind of news, pieces of news, you know,
A:	so it's hard,
A:	I never did see the full story,
A:	so I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they said that, that it really caused so much smog over, uh, the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, uh, piloting, uh, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible, because the, there's nothing,
B:	Um.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean that's such a spectacle.
A:	It would be a shame to ruin it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to alleviate this problem.
B:	Uh, I don't, uh, I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. Uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing. Um,
A:	Right.
B:	apart from that, I, I don't know what we can do as individuals.
B:	What do you think we can do?
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	you think, it's more, more to society.
A:	Well I guess I kind of agree there.
A:	I, uh,
A:	on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things
A:	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect to deal more seriously with it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I do think that we have a responsibility there.
A:	I must admit I'm not always real politically active
A:	but I do think that, um, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's brought the,
A:	they, uh, really listen to
A:	the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,
A:	they ,
A:	all those restrictions are really too hard,
A:	we can't, we can't quite make that go
A:	and they don't
A:	and then we still live with air pollution.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.
A:	But, um, as a society, I think we can do more
A:	and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, being individually responsible as, uh, in order to be group responsible.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess I'm, I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it.
A:	Right.
B:	And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to, uh, to get rid of the source of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I suspect that the that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, uh, come to bear on the companies that deal with it
A:	and probably the only way that can happen is for, um, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I don't know how long that, that will take.
B:	People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.
B:	So, if you don't want to burn coal for power, how about nuclear energy.
A:	Sure.
B:	Well we don't want that either.
A:	Exactly,
A:	yeah,
A:	right.
B:	How about investing in the sun.
B:	Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, I don't think.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.
A:	Well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,
A:	now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems we recently had
B:	Oh yes,
B:	yes,
B:	yes.
A:	and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent
A:	and they don't want, they don't want to pay for it.
A:	So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, you know,
A:	however, it might have had other causes.
A:	Certainly oil was a big factor.
B:	Oh certainly,
B:	yes.
A:	Um, and I think that's probably going to happen with, with such things as air pollution, when we, when we get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help. Um, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	do you have any air pollution in your area?
B:	There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.
B:	Uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,
B:	I think it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area Linda
A:	Oh no.
B:	That's what they, that's what they,
A:	You're talking about from, from the, uh, the middle, middle states, that, that have more factories and so on.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's what they say
B:	but it's it's not, it's not very usual
B:	and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we really don't have that either.
A:	Although I think I can tell a difference in, I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, uh, particularly in the summer. Uh, you know, when it gets hot, and you have, the, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, uh, usually they say caused by exhaust.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable
A:	and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.
A:	So I suspect that it's, it's an ever growing problem.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.
B:	Right,
B:	I think, we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	and I enjoyed the conversation.
A:	So did I.
A:	Bye, bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.
A:	And I would it like that,
A:	I, I like the adventure of it. And the idea that, that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I like the,
A:	they have a new one now.
A:	The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION. Which it's an all new cast, but kind of the same idea, going out to new places and, and doing new things and finding out about different people,
B:	Right
A:	and I've, I've always liked that show probably the very best.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS, one way or another over the years. Uh, although I never watched it regularly.
B:	I'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies.
A:	Yeah,
A:	those,
A:	the movies are good too.
A:	And I, I guess all, most of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When I, when I started thinking about this, that those are some of my favorite shows, MCGYVER, because it's, it's only one person there, more than, uh, you know, instead of a cast of people,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and, and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider
A:	and
B:	I don't think I, I've even heard of that show.
A:	You haven't?
B:	It's called MCGYVER?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And what is, what is he?
A:	He's like a semigovernment type agent. Who goes out then to, uh, works for the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, his big thing is that he can take pieces of, little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.
A:	He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he, he does all kinds of strange things like that.
B:	Oh, great.
B:	Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard, and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See what we can come up with.
A:	Do you like the, uh, news shows, TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things?
B:	Well, uh, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact,
B:	and uh, and I used to like the show very much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out some, some of the baby, with the bath water.
A:	Some of the little things,
A:	yeah.
B:	And uh, I just decided I had to do that. I think, in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it,
B:	I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours.
A:	Uh.
B:	And I just realized, I was sort of like an alcoholic,
B:	if I didn't get the booze out of the house, I was going to drink.
A:	Oh.
B:	So.
A:	I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that.
A:	I have more or less, I have my favorite shows
A:	and I usually make time in my day or my week, you know, to watch those.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, for the most part, I try, I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Because they're,
A:	I guess that, that, that falls ,
A:	and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids.
A:	I like that real well.
B:	Right,
B:	well, when my kids were little, I did have a T V set
B:	and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well.
A:	I don't think they have that on anymore.
B:	Well that would be a shame.
A:	I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time.
A:	I, I remember it when I was younger of, you know, catching it on P B S,
A:	but, uh, I don't think they show,
A:	it must be in,
A:	maybe it's in,
A:	if it was in repeats,
A:	but they're not making new ones.
B:	Huh.
A:	I haven't seen it in a long time.
A:	But SESAME STREET is still really good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	How about MISTER ROGERS,
B:	is he still around?
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They still show MISTER ROGERS.
A:	I don't think he's making new ones,
A:	but they repeat all the old ones.
B:	I see.
B:	I see.
A:	So that's still a real good show too.
A:	I,
A:	that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten, which is a good time
A:	and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go,
A:	so it's
A:	the timing of, of it is good, besides the what's on.
B:	Right.
B:	I figure your children are preschool?
A:	Yes,
A:	I have two little ones.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So they like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon.
A:	They come on both.
A:	They come on like from nine to ten and then from, uh, five to six.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	okay.
A:	They just repeat over again. Which is also,
B:	Okay.
A:	that's another thing that's good about it,
A:	when it comes on right in the dinner hour. I can feel like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch,
A:	and they're watching something worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do without them under foot.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	little, with little kids the T V set really is a, I mean
B:	I used it as a pacifier.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm not sure it was that great for my children,
B:	but they turned out okay,
B:	so.
A:	Uh, it didn't hurt them any.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Some shows are good for,
A:	I think some shows, some,
A:	STAR TREK, I,
A:	for the imagination of it all.
A:	The idea, I, I think that's one of the things I like about STAR TREK.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And is, is the,
A:	even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff.
A:	I don't let my little ones watch it,
A:	but the imagination of, look what we can do, you know, in the future, this is, perhaps, this will be possible. That kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows.
B:	Well, I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time, uh.
A:	Let's see, how about, uh, MAN FROM UNCLE?
B:	I do seem to
B:	is that the one where they, uh, he always got this, this tape recording that self-destructed?
A:	That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
B:	Uh, MISSION,
B:	that's right,
B:	MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I used to watch that.
B:	In fact, I can still remember a couple of those.
B:	They were,
B:	I thought those were very good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they always have,
A:	I've, I've seen some of them on repeats.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That uh,
A:	they always had a good plot.
B:	Huh.
A:	It kind of kept you guessing on, on, uh, what was going to happen next
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	You,
A:	How they're going get out of their latest scrape.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do remember that.
B:	And, uh, I remember as a kid my parents watching the ED SULLIVAN Show.
B:	That was really the big deal in our household, was the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	every Saturday night?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I guess it was a Saturday night,
B:	and I went to see the movie THE DOORS a couple of days ago,
B:	and they had this scene, uh, that portraying THE DOORS' appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.
A:	Huh.
B:	They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan,
B:	and it was very, very funny.
B:	I think it was the funniest part of the, of that movie.
A:	Um.
B:	Well, I don't know,
B:	was there any,
B:	I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even,
B:	I was, I was,
A:	I'm not old enough to recall that one
B:	well I guess, I have to admit that I am
A:	My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties,
A:	so.
B:	I see.
A:	My folks didn't, my folks,
A:	I'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little.
A:	That may be why,
A:	they probably didn't have a T V until I got to be, you know, grade school or so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the shows that I like now, they wouldn't let me watch.
A:	I had to catch them all on repeats.
A:	Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent for small children.
A:	So
B:	Huh.
A:	I, I, I ended up watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's, that's interesting.
B:	Uh, I think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV,
B:	people were just as violent before T V was invented, maybe even more so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I guess that's, that's a different topic
B:	isn't it?
A:	Probably so
A:	Well, I think that's about, uh, that's about covered it for me,
A:	so I think I'll say good-bye
A:	and we'll talk another time perhaps
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
B:	Tell me, tell me where you're calling from.
A:	I'm calling from Garland, Texas.
B:	Garland, Texas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	All right.
B:	I'm in
A:	Where are you from?
B:	I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	I didn't know they did it long distance.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they're doing it, trying to do it, or I hope they're trying to do it all over the country, because they need to collect all kinds of different different dialects.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, it was nice talking to you
B:	Same here.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, the last movie that I saw,
A:	I, I don't go to that many
A:	so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see,
A:	but, uh, it was AWAKENINGS with, uh, Robin Williams and, uh, Peter DeNiro.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Have you seen it.
B:	No
B:	unfortunately I haven't,
B:	I heard it's really good,
B:	but.
A:	It is.
A:	I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He is one of the best actors I've ever seen.
A:	It's,
A:	there's a point where,
A:	the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that,
A:	this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less,
A:	but it wears off.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh,
A:	it starts off with like a tic,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all.
A:	And it was just so realistic.
A:	The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What does, uh,
B:	is
B:	Robby, Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it?
A:	No,
A:	it was very serious, very
B:	Oh how does he do serious.
A:	He's good,
A:	he's, he's talented,
A:	boy, he is.
B:	I've only seen him in funny stuff
B:	and so.
A:	I know,
A:	me too.
A:	But, uh, well, what was that show, um, uh,
A:	I want to say Garfield
A:	but that wasn't it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, GARP, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.
A:	Yeah,
A:	THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.
A:	He wasn't always funny in that show, was he.
B:	I didn't read, see the, the movie,
B:	I read the book
B:	but I,
A:	I did too.
A:	That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part
B:	Yeah,
B:	in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well what have you seen?
B:	I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
A:	Oh, I saw it.
B:	Good,
B:	we've both seen one
B:	Did you cry through it?
A:	Yes,
A:	the whole way
B:	It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice,
B:	but each was about half an hour long,
B:	so.
A:	Where did you cry.
B:	Um, let's see,
B:	when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, I think from there on, all the way through the movie.
B:	Let's see what else did it. Um, what other parts.
B:	I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.
A:	I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed
B:	I don't remember when the horse got killed.
A:	Oh,
A:	when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You can tell I'm an animal lover,
A:	you can hear my dog
B:	Unfortunately we don't have any animals,
B:	so, uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It was a beautiful story,
A:	it really was.
B:	It,
B:	there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	What did you think about the buffalo scenes.
A:	Oh, I thought it was awful, and so graphic,
B:	That was,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know.
A:	I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie.
B:	Oh, oh.
A:	Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's not,
A:	But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.
A:	No
A:	it wasn't
B:	Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,
B:	like that was great.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And there were so many of them.
B:	I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really.
B:	So that was pretty.
A:	And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.
B:	I wonder how they kept up with them, though,
B:	it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.
A:	I know.
B:	I guess they graze, though,
B:	that wouldn't be a problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	It was,
A:	they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes
A:	and, uh, they had to teach a wolf how to, to howl.
B:	Oh.
A:	That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves
B:	I guess they're just not domesticated,
B:	or, or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	what,
A:	they just don't howl that much anymore.
A:	I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off
A:	and that's all they'd have to do
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well that's funny.
A:	Well, I think we've made it.
B:	Oh is that five minutes,
B:	is that,
A:	I don't know,
A:	is it five or three.
B:	Okay, oh,
B:	I'm not sure.
A:	I'm not either.
B:	Okay,
B:	well I think we're, we're, we've done okay, though.
A:	Okay,
A:	me too.
B:	Well thank you for calling.
A:	Well thank you.
B:	And I hope you enjoy some more good movies
A:	Yeah,
A:	you too.
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	Bye, bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute.
B:	Okay. Yes,
A:	a deep Well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,
A:	isn't it
B:	it is
B:	It's one we all hold dear and near, I'm sure.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	most of mine's been pretty good, although I'm, I guess I'm like a lot of other people, now,
B:	I'm trying to, to pay off my credit cards
B:	and, and, uh, I've done pretty good at it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Well, I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want You know not need, want.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	there is a big difference
A:	There's a big difference there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah,
B:	I, I do that,
B:	I do that,
B:	but the rest, like I said, the rest of them I've been trying to, to pay off and, uh, get back on a cash basis, except for gas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's too easy to, to run into the gas station.
A:	Oh, it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way
B:	And, .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	At least that's for me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	But yeah,
A:	I've, I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience
A:	and kind of knock on wood I haven't yet, not bad.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well that's,
A:	You know, I just, I'm just shocked at the end of the month, to see what damage I have did,
A:	but I try to keep it pretty reasonable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, I've been pretty lucky in that respect.
B:	I don't charge, like I say, I've, I been trying to, to not charge except for emergencies.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so, but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards.
B:	There's, you know,
B:	they have, uh, wonderful features,
B:	they're there when you need them. You know, like in emergencies, or whatever.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	And then they have bad drawbacks, too.  I mean high interest,
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's, it's awfully easy.
A:	it's like paying twice.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true,
A:	Yes,
A:	so, .
B:	I try to,
B:	I did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though. That seems to be a pretty low interest. Yeah, compared to some of the other ones.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And you don't have an annual fee there,
B:	and that helps.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Uh, we used to have, you know, like several,
A:	but right now, we're just more or less at American Express, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it instead of saying, well, I'll just pay on it this month
A:	Yeah.
A:	Pay fifteen,
A:	yeah.
B:	and
A:	Yes,
A:	I know,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time.
B:	Takes a long time,
B:	that's right.
A:	It sure does.
B:	And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax that's, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course it's been going down for a number of years,
B:	but this is the last year you can take anything.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
A:	And maybe we'll get to talk again.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
B:	Okay.
A:	and they kind of are in different spectrums, I think. Um,
A:	one of them is QUANTUM LEAP
B:	Okay.
A:	and the other one is NIGHT COURT.
A:	And I think, I think they're real different, I mean,
A:	I don't think they have anything in common,
A:	um, QUANTUM, LEAP has, I mean QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way, I guess,
A:	but, uh, mostly it's, it's kind of science fiction,
A:	and, it's, um, it's adventure and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then NIGHT COURT is just pure, you know, weird fun, you know,
A:	just, it's, it's nothing serious about it at all.
A:	So, I don't know why the two of them happen, to be my two favorite shows,
A:	but they, that's the way it is,
A:	so.
B:	It's funny that those are my two, my husband's two favorite shows, too,
B:	and I enjoy both, watching both of them,
B:	but I used to didn't like NIGHT COURT
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I,
B:	and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it so much
B:	and I'm involved with the characters,
B:	but, I used to think, um, Dan Fielding was just too, too vulgar and too crude for me.
A:	He is
B:	And I told my husband, that's the whole point,
B:	but
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right,
A:	I mean,
B:	I, I just,
B:	it's,
B:	I find him degrading at times.
B:	I guess that is the point,
B:	but sometimes it just,
A:	Well, they, they really have changed him though.
A:	If, If you've watched it this season, um, he's becoming, I mean, he still is in his own way degrading and everything,
A:	but, uh, he's involved in that charity,
A:	and, uh, it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought, that he really has,
A:	in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman just because the idea that he was, his mind was on the ozone layer and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.
B:	Oh.
A:	And he, you know, was too depressed, you know, to,
A:	so that was part of, I guess, his character building or whatever,
A:	but,
B:	I think it adds a, probably adds a little bit of depth to his character.
B:	I haven't watched, um
A:	Which of course he needed
B:	yeah,
B:	I think so,
B:	which in QUANTUM LEAP you get
B:	even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives, you still see a, a real person in those situations.
B:	He gets, um, he's doing amazing things
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	that's a good point,
B:	and I think that's,
B:	I like that.
A:	So what do you, what do you consider your favorite shows?
B:	Um, I think my favorite show is HUNTER.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, I, I like the old series better when, um Dede was in there.
A:	Dede,
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree.
B:	and, um, so, uh, uh, and then the blond that they took out, the one that got killed
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can't remember what her name is,
A:	but is,
B:	yeah,
B:	I didn't enjoy her.
B:	I, I,
B:	she was too much of a opposite of Dede,
B:	and I think that's what they try to do,
B:	but I think we wanted to see Dede there or somebody like her.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, but, see I read an article about, in T V GUIDE about, uh, about HUNTER, and about his, you know, latest, you know, his three girls, whatever you want to call them
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they say that, uh, that there was that there was like a conflict between her and him, uh, that they never really could get her into, uh, any character that they could use.
A:	I mean, you know, uh
B:	The second lady?
A:	yeah,
A:	the second one the blond
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
A:	you know, if you think about it, they didn't really interact hardly at all
B:	They didn't.
A:	I mean, they were never partners.
B:	Yeah,
B:	she would go her way,
B:	and he would do his,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that's what I didn't like.
A:	And, and, and even, even at the beginning Dede and, and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this, while the other one would do, would go this,
A:	but, uh, it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	like Hunter was the boss,
A:	and this other girl was not,
A:	and, you know, you kind of, you're wondering, you know, well when did this happen?
B:	Right.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	I, I kind of agree with that.
B:	And I like the new lady better,
B:	but I'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there.
B:	I'd just as soon have the, the police story without all the romance.
A:	Well, I'm afraid that's what they, they really wanted to do, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think most shows were doing that,
B:	and then they went away from it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and now they're starting to go back to it,
B:	and maybe that's what the public wants,
B:	I don't know,
B:	but I just, I like the, the cut and dry solve the mystery,
B:	and that's what I always enjoyed about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, see, there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they, they like started it,
A:	and then they'd pull it back,
A:	and they'd start it and pull it back.
A:	And that really made it a very interesting, uh, show to where you never really knew which, which one was going to show up. You know, whether it was going to, where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, that, that I kind of thought was good,
A:	but, um, you know, it's, I guess, you know,
A:	you always kind of sit there
A:	and you see these two people together,
A:	and you always wonder, why they don't, you know, get together or whatever.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so I guess that's what they decide to do
B:	Just go ahead and quit the wondering
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and,
A:	But it's, it's always been a formula, uh, for T V that the minute that two people, that the two main stars get married, that the show ends up, you know, dying.
B:	Yeah.
A:	A, a, good example of this, and, you know, this is
A:	maybe it's not a good example.
A:	I've been watching Nickelodeon all last week, because they had what they called MAXIMUM SMART.
A:	They had GET SMART for, uh, ten hours a day, from seven o'clock at night, until six or until five o'clock the next morning. All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see.
B:	Oh.
A:	Well, the, the last day, all they did was the last season, to where the two of them got married
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that was, I mean, that was the killer,
A:	the series died right after that, because,
B:	I didn't, I was going to say, I didn't ever watch MOONLIGHTING,
A:	well go ahead.
B:	but I heard that's what killed it
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	same thing.
B:	that, uh, interplay died when they got married,
B:	and so the show died.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the,
A:	it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they, they, before they get married you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the minute they get married, everything's supposed to be cut and dried
A:	and and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, I think, is they have a tendency to change characters, or to change the characters', uh, uh, personalities well, especially after they get married.
B:	Right.
B:	Halfway through,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, couple of examples would be, um, well, like I said, this one about Max or Get Well Smart, the female character, Barbara Feldon
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she had been at the beginning the, the intelligent one, the, the one who always solved the things and, and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up.
A:	Well, in short, whenever they got married, she got dingy.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know, why would they do that?
B:	Yeah.
A:	It made no sense.
B:	I, I'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows
A:	Unfortunately, that's probably true.
B:	yeah,
B:	which kind of,
B:	like in the big soap opera shows, which I don't enjoy because of that,
B:	but,
A:	Well, do you you watch, um, what is that show, WHO'S THE BOSS?
A:	That's, uh, that's on Tuesday nights I think.
B:	I've seen it before,
B:	but I don't watch it regularly.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I I hardly ever watch it,
B:	Usually Tuesday nights I'm out,
B:	so.
A:	but, as, as I've seen it, they've, they've done sort of the same thing to where they've, they started to let them get together,
A:	and then they pulled them apart
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think they're thinking about that exact thing, about the idea that if the show lets them, uh, get together, then you lose part of what the show's all about.
B:	but I've never actually seen the place itself, you,  know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's pretty, set far back, off the road.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	It
A:	and that's something I like, too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because  a lot of those places are like, you know the one over here on seventy-eight, Skaggs.
B:	Definitely.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That little Kinder Care, whatever it is?
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, it's right there on,
A:	which this is on a highway, too.
A:	But it's set back,  enough to,
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	There's a difference.
A:	I'm scared, I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out,
A:	or or, if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could,  you know, go, in and get one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep.
B:	That's right.
B:	Or, you know, or a car accident.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And,  that was one of the places I had checked out.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it was, it, it was brand new when I checked it out
A:	and, of course, it was beautiful and,  clean and smelled wonderful in there,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, you know, I, that,
A:	I didn't base everything on that.
B:	No,
B:	because that all wears off.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's exactly right.
A:	You get some kids in there
A:	and it's,  over quick.
B:	Yep.
A:	But, um, I've been real pleased, knock on wood.
A:	I'm scared to death her going to public school.
B:	Really?
A:	I don't know,
A:	I,
A:	I do know why because you know,  drugs and, everything else
B:	I would be, too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, they talk about how soon they start that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that scares me.
B:	I know.
B:	It is scary.
A:	I mean, you're just with them,
B:	Do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs?
A:	Yeah.
A:	They've, um, they've had police officers come in and talk to them about it.
B:	Good.
A:	But, of course, they still have no concept of,  what in the world drugs are, you, know
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	but,
B:	And what to do when they're faced with it.
A:	Right.
A:	But I just think of her, you know,
A:	next year she's going to be five, six years old in kindergarten, in same school with, you know, uh, I guess ten year olds.
A:	Isn't that,  six, sixth, sixth grade, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's a big gap.
B:	It is.
A:	And that's, uh, that, I can honestly see the peer pressure there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that,  just,  terrifies me to death. And stuff,
B:	Oh, I can,  see it, too.
A:	those kids getting snatched
A:	and I'm, I'm probably a little too over protective
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, Well, nowadays you have to be.
B:	Nothing wrong with that
B:	Yes.
B:	You do.
A:	If,
B:	I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
A:	So, I at first thought, you know, when I didn't have kids,
A:	I was going, God, how can you be so protective beginning with You,  know
B:	Uh-huh
A:	but, it's easy now
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now you understand
A:	Yeah.
A:	Definitely.
B:	That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say, when you have kids of your own,  you'll understand
A:	That's exactly right
A:	and I do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But anyway.
A:	Well, are you ever, are you, are you, are you married
B:	Yes.
A:	Are y'all planning on having kids?
A:	Or,
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because they're really neat.
A:	It's just.
B:	Do you live in Plano or work in Plano, or both?
A:	Both.
B:	Both,
B:	are you a T I
A:	Yes.
B:	Are you at work right now?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So am I.
B:	In building, which building?
A:	Well, are you Summit or are you, uh,  Spring Creek?
B:	I'm, I'm,  I'm Spring Creek.
A:	Oh this is fun.
A:	What building are you in?
B:	I'm building, uh, one.
A:	Oh, I'm building two.
A:	At least we found something different
A:	That's,
A:	I've never had a call,
B:	Not like that.
B:	Neither have I.
A:	No,
A:	isn't that funny?
A:	I usually get some place,
A:	I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called, I think.
B:	Right.
B:	That's funny.
A:	That is funny.
A:	So,
B:	So how's the how's the weather in building two?
A:	The weather in building two is cold
A:	it's been cold.
A:	It's been cold in the building.
A:	Outside the building it's not bad.
A:	Typical T I, or T I,
A:	listen I got me doing it.
A:	Typical Texas Spring.
A:	Are you a native to Texas?
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	I'm, I'm a transplant.
A:	From?
B:	From California.
A:	So what do you think of the Texas weather?
B:	Not as nice as California
A:	How long have you been here?
B:	Oh, five years now.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I've been here long pretty long.
B:	So.
A:	You, you, you know about August then.
B:	Yes,
B:	oh, I've been through five of those
A:	Okay,
A:	there's no surprises left.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August, for, you know,
B:	if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Good idea.
A:	Real good idea.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.
B:	And it was like you know, eighty degrees up there.
B:	It was beautiful.
B:	Nice to get out of Texas for a while.
A:	We went to Alaska.
B:	Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away.
A:	That is really nice.
A:	It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know.
B:	Even in the Summer time, huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	or keep one handy. Because it's, it rains a lot in Alaska.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Uh, it,
A:	they call it their liquid gold.
B:	Um.
A:	But it, you know,
A:	you get sunshine,
A:	and it's lovely,
A:	and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming.
B:	Green.
B:	Um.
A:	Oh my goodness, it's pretty.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, Texas isn't bad.
B:	No,
B:	no.
A:	Not in the Spring.
B:	Right.
B:	I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's it supposed to like this time of year.
A:	Spring is nice.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, you know.
B:	It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, you know, on the local news.
A:	Right.
B:	March we typically get a lot of rain,
B:	and we've had this many inches,
B:	and, you know, we're right on target, you know,
B:	and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March,
B:	but I
A:	Oh, we always we always do though.
B:	it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like.
B:	Yeah
A:	uh, it,
B:	I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once
A:	That's right,
A:	and then we get all that heat.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, it's just that, you know,
B:	when it rains, it rains.
B:	In California you get these nice, lovely rains, you know, nothing really you know, like downpours like you have here.
B:	The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I live in Garland.
A:	Oh, you got into that bad stuff.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We got hail the size of marbles.
B:	I mean, just so noisy hitting the house
B:	and the glass on the windows.
B:	It didn't break anything,
B:	but we went out there afterwards
B:	and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn.
A:	Isn't that strange.
B:	I know, I,
B:	you pick them up, you know,
B:	and they're perfectly round.
B:	And I go, gee, how did they form, you know, so perfect like that.
A:	I think that's one of the strange, strange things,
A:	and you very seldom see it though.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	I've seen hail, you know,
B:	but usually the size, you know, of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.
B:	You know, really small, you know.
B:	But this was, uh, really large.
A:	So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently.
A:	Is that correct?
B:	Uh, I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth.
A:	I think, I think that's,
B:	You don't think it's cold enough, you know to,
A:	It's not on the ground,
A:	but in the clouds it is.
B:	Right,
B:	must be.
B:	I guess,
B:	and then, I think, you know, all that falling would warm it up and melt it,
B:	but maybe that's what rounds it, I don't know. But, tumbling.
A:	I was dumb.
A:	I was in, um, Florida for a week on business.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I had called back to the house.
A:	I stayed the weekend,
A:	and I called back to the house.
A:	My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, pitched said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,
A:	it's in Garland where all the bad weather is.
A:	I said, Okay, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I watched the news,
A:	and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not Plano,
A:	I don't have anything to worry about.
A:	I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland
A:	Felt so dumb.
B:	Um.
A:	Finally I got home and found out my property was okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	There was no problem with it.
A:	But I guess you just tend to think of, of where your house is you know, and nothing else.
B:	Right.
B:	Right,
B:	and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's, there's the hard rain.
A:	Oh, oh, I see.
B:	The creek overflows
B:	and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek seem to, to get flooded
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	the streets and stuff around that area,  get a lot of flooding.
A:	The house, that house,  that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course.
B:	Okay.
A:	Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through.
B:	Right.
B:	That's where I live, close to that.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, uh, not quite,
B:	I don't live in that Firewheel division.
B:	But I live close by there in north, far north Garland.
A:	Is that a nice area?
B:	Yeah
B:	they're supposed to,
B:	it's getting built up, you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things. You know,
B:	it's a fairly new area.
B:	Yeah
B:	and, uh, and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,
B:	a brand new mall not too far away from that area,
A:	Well,
B:	so.
A:	The house that the house that I bought was really, really nice.
B:	It'd be nice.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really, really nice home, very pretty. Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you're not living there right now.
A:	No,
A:	I'm going to lease it.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	It's, it's investment property.
B:	I see.
A:	But it is really, it's a very nice place.
A:	Uh, I, I would cheerfully live there.
A:	Of course it's not my home,
A:	and I've lived in my home in, well, almost ten years,
A:	and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it.
B:	Right.
A:	But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.
A:	It's a nice house.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's a nice area.
B:	Is it on the golf course?
A:	No,
A:	it's not,
A:	it's off the golf course,
A:	and I'll be honest with you,
A:	I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is.
B:	Is that right.
A:	But it's in the estates that adjoin it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
B:	right.
B:	Well that's a nice area.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
B:	That really is a nice area.
B:	When they get that highway finished, you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the the outermost loop around.
B:	Right,
B:	another belt line, just, uh, farther out.
A:	Right,
A:	just continue to do that.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	right.
A:	Where are you from in California?
B:	Southern California.
A:	San Diego?
B:	I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a younger, and L A area,
B:	and my parents live in Anaheim right now.
B:	Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to anyway.
A:	I've been through all of that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area with boulders,
A:	I
A:	they're not really hills,
A:	they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation.
B:	Huh.
B:	I'm not familiar with what,
B:	is it along the coast or or inland.
A:	Uh. Well, you know, it may be a little bit more inland.
A:	That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago
B:	Out there,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we went up that coastline,
A:	and I was just amazed how unusual that looks.
B:	Huh.
A:	Here, hang on just a second,
A:	I've got a Los Angeles map.
A:	Let me just quick
B:	Yeah,
A:	valley.
A:	Yes
B:	Okay,
B:	I know where that is.
A:	beyond Thousand Oaks.
B:	I know where Valley is,
B:	I've been out there before,
B:	sure.
A:	You don't think that's strange looking.
B:	I didn't notice anything strange, I guess about it.
A:	Oh, okay
A:	maybe, maybe I'm used to Texas.
B:	Maybe Texas the way,
A:	The elevation is extremely high.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's got curving roads on it,
A:	but, but the,
A:	it's just a strange landscape,
A:	there's very little vegetation.
B:	Huh.
B:	I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it.
B:	I know Valley,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's just a suburb of L A.
A:	Right.
A:	It's a,
B:	And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.
B:	People can get in and out of L A easier.
A:	Maybe it's a place I went to,
A:	it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place.
B:	Huh.
A:	It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	sounds interesting.
B:	Right.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	I, I know exactly that area.
B:	It's a nice area out there.
B:	I love Thousand Oaks.
B:	Uh, Texas, I don't know,
B:	thing, things,
B:	you just have less a variety, I guess.
B:	I think, I don't think it's quite as green, you know.
B:	It's green with all the trees and things out here
B:	but it's just,
A:	Oh, it's green sometime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but it's just, you know,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, it doesn't stay green, you know
B:	Right.
A:	the really,
A:	and in all honesty,
A:	I know this sounds like a Texas story,
A:	all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.
A:	We haven't had a really bad one,
B:	Yeah
B:	I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that had the heat wave.
A:	Oh.
A:	It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one
A:	and we built a pool in eighty-two,
A:	Okay
B:	Okay
A:	Um, well, I'm not,
A:	I mean, I read a lot,
A:	but I don't, I don't read a whole,
A:	I mean, uh, eh, eh, eh, I, I, I, I tend to read like only out of a couple, you know, groups.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I'm, a, uh, I'm a big baseball fan,
A:	so I tend to read a lot of the baseball books
A:	and,
B:	I'm a big baseball fan too.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	And, uh, I read a lot of science fiction.
B:	well, I like,
B:	I teach school,
B:	and so during the school year, I just don't have time to read.
B:	And I, you know, I would love to, to be able to read more because I, I enjoy it so much.
B:	But with correcting papers and, and I, two kids of my own, I just don't have time.
B:	But in the summer, I try to read a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, of course, being a woman, I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot.
B:	I just,
B:	I really enjoy that because it's kind of a, a getaway type thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I, I read a lot of that.
B:	But I also love sports.
B:	And, uh, uh, I, I don't have time to read in,
B:	but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED during the, the year because my son gets that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, but, uh, I don't read a lot of nonfiction,
B:	and I really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would, would be, benefit me greatly,
B:	but I just don't.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, um, I don't really, I probably should.
A:	I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that.
A:	I, uh, um, I'll get like, uh, books on history and stuff like that that look interesting.
A:	And I, uh, of course, I don't ever get around to reading them
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know, I got, uh, um,
A:	I I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club.
B:	Oh, do you?
A:	And I'll get, get stuff out of that.
A:	Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, you know,  like a couple of years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I started reading, and got about sixty pages into it
A:	and it's like eight hundred pages
B:	Oh, my word.
A:	And it was like, uh, I want to read something else for a while
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's,
B:	some of those books are real tough to get into,
B:	but after you get into them, they're really good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, especially, you know, well,
A:	BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off, you know, in the eighteen forties, you know. And it's like,
B:	Yeah.
A:	wait, the war wasn't until the you know.
A:	It's like, okay,
A:	and I realize these things, you know.
A:	These things take awhile like to move up,
A:	but it's, you know, it's hard sometimes.
B:	It's right,
B:	that's right.
B:	I find though, that if, when I find an author,
B:	uh, and you don't read a lot of fiction, you said.
B:	But when I find,
A:	I read a lot of science fiction.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. Because you, you get used to their style and you really enjoy it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, and
A:	I, I do the same thing.
A:	I,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, there's one science fiction writer named, uh, Allen Dean Foster.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've heard of him.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	yeah.
A:	He, um,
A:	I must have like fifty or sixty books by him
B:	Is that right?
A:	I mean, I have, you know, I have everything he's ever well, almost everything he's ever done.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, you know, I, I know that when I, you know, when I get his book I'm, I'm usually going to enjoy it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Um, so it's really, you know,
A:	it's, it's fun to, to do that. Uh,
B:	Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction?
B:	I think that's unbelievable.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, he does a lot of like, um, uh, movie adaptations and things like that.
B:	Oh, does he really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, his adaptations are usually really good.
B:	Oh
A:	Um, it's, it's funny he, um,
A:	the, the novelization of STAR WARS was
A:	you know, it, it was out in the, uh, in the stores as being by George Lucas.
A:	But it turns out that, uh, Foster actually, uh, ghost wrote it for him.
B:	Is that right?
A:	which, you know,
A:	when I read it, I should have realized that because, I mean, it had Foster's style written all over it
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I, I've never read anything of his,
B:	but I've heard about him.
B:	But wouldn't you think he would,
B:	does he get some royalties from that, hopefully?
A:	Oh, I'm sure he does
B:	Well, I would think he would
A:	I'd hope so.
A:	Well, I mean he's doing all right, probably
B:	Oh, I'm sure he is,
B:	I'm sure he is.
B:	But sometimes the more you get the more you want too,
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, yeah.
A:	You, you're a baseball fan,
A:	you're, you're aware of that kind of thing
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, right,
B:	right,
B:	right.
B:	I, in fact, I'm a sports fan, period.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We,
B:	I mean, that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much
B:	because there's everything in it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I had a, uh, had a subscription to that last year,
A:	but I'm, uh, I'm mostly a baseball fan.
A:	So I'm,  I'm not, as you know,
B:	Oh.
A:	the other stuff is interesting
A:	but, um, I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff.
B:	So you're probably, uh, a Baltimore fan, right, an Oriole fan?
A:	Uh, actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Boston?
B:	Oh, well, that's good too.
A:	Um, but, uh, I, I, I do like the Orioles also.
B:	I'm, I'm sure you do.
B:	Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here.
A:	Yeah
B:	But I, I was, uh,
B:	I'm not from here.
B:	I'm originally from Ohio,
B:	so I've always followed the Tigers. Because, you know, I was,  I was born and raised in Toledo.
A:	Toledo.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was in Toledo last summer.
A:	Went to a, uh, to a Mud Hens double header
B:	Oh, I love the Mud Hens
B:	They're great.
B:	I love the name
B:	and, there  was a really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I saved that issue, actually.
B:	Did you?
A:	Um, that's when I had the subscription.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I
B:	I really enjoy that team.
B:	I, we used to go there all the time.
B:	I used to live in Iowa too,
B:	and they have the Iowa Oaks.
B:	And we used to go, go to their games all the time.
B:	And,
A:	They don't exist anymore,
A:	I don't,  think.
B:	I know,   I know they don't.
A:	At least not by that name.
A:	There's the Iowa Cubs,
A:	but I don't know if they play,  in the same location.
B:	Oh, they must,  they must have changed then. Because it used, well
B:	I haven't lived there for
B:	I've been here for like twelve years now,
B:	so. And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time.
B:	But we used to always go to their games,
A:	Um.
B:	and it was kind of fun.
B:	It's almost, uh, more fun than going to a major league game.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I just really enjoy the,   farm teams.
A:	I,
A:	minor league,  baseball, I think is a lot more fun than,  major league baseball.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
B:	It's not quite so serious, you know.
A:	And it's a lot cheaper
B:	That's for sure,
B:	that's, for sure.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's, um, there's a city just west of of, uh Baltimore, called Frederick.
A:	It's about forty miles west.
B:	Is that right?
A:	And they have a minor league team.
A:	And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles
A:	and, um,
B:	Is that right?
A:	I,
A:	it's just a lot of fun.
A:	I mean, it's free parking
A:	and three you know, four bucks now to get in.
A:	And, you know, the hot dogs are a dollar
A:	and, and it's just great.
B:	Well, how, like how much is an Oriole game?
A:	Oriole game?
A:	If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium, it's four bucks.
A:	The ticket, the the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty.
B:	Oh, gosh.
B:	See, it's higher than the Rangers.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	the food here is outrageous.
B:	But, uh, you can get a good seat for, uh, well
B:	it used to be three dollars.
B:	But I think it's gone up to four dollars this year.
A:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	But, you know, it's in the bleachers, way out in the, you know, in center field,
B:	but it's still nice.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You still can see well.
B:	And, uh, we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets, you know, box seats or something, then we usually sit out there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well how much are the box seats there?
A:	Do you know offhand?
B:	Box seats run from, oh, like eight dollars to twelve dollars.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, um, that's a little steeper.
A:	I think the, uh, most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks.
A:	But we're getting a new stadium next year
A:	so,
B:	Oh, so it'll go up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it'll go up.
A:	And, if it opens
A:	It's, uh, something we're really irritated about around here.
A:	Or some people are really irritated about.
A:	They're, they're building this new they built the new stadium downtown.
A:	And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I park for free up at, at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free
B:	Oh, oh.
A:	And, um, I'm not going to be able to do that downtown
B:	Uh, that's, yeah, that's a bummer.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We,
B:	Well, see, baseball here though is the cheapest game in town. Because the Cowboys,
B:	it's it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the Mavericks are
B:	it's high too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So baseball's cheap,  compared to other games.
A:	Weren't you guys,  supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas?
B:	Well, that didn't go over,  now.
A:	Oh, it it didn't,  go through.
B:	They, they,  they decided, you know, George Bush, who, who's the main owner of the Rangers, decided that, uh, they'd stay in Arlington.
B:	So Arlington's going to build a stadium, a bigger one.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So we're going to, they're going to stay there. Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.
B:	And, and that was their main, main money making, you know,  deal for the city.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because everything,
B:	there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet 'n Wild
B:	and,  and it, you know, that's,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	all the tourists come there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and they,
B:	it would have been devastated,
B:	they would have collapsed.
B:	So I'm kind of glad they're staying there. Because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth-Dallas,
B:	and, you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, that's what I'd always heard,
A:	I've, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	We, you know, we, I like it there.
B:	And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything
B:	So, I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's takes us maybe, uh, well, thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano, which is not too bad at all.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um,  it's it actually funny that, um, I live just outside of Baltimore.
B:	So,
A:	And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick, but as it does to go to the, the ballpark in in, uh, Baltimore. Because, um, to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate
B:	Is that right?
A:	and,
A:	because I live just south of the Interstate.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	hop on the Interstate,
A:	and the stadium's right off the Interstate
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	So, it's like I drive west
A:	and I'm there.
A:	And, you know, and then to go into Baltimore, I mean, it well, it's fewer miles,
A:	but I've got to go, stop and go traffic and everything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you read, um,
A:	I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
A:	but you don't read many sports books
A:	or,
B:	Well, not really.
B:	Now my son does,
B:	I have, I have a son that just turned sixteen,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he reads everything he gets, he gets his, get his hands on.
B:	He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan.
B:	He's a basketball fan because he, he plays for the high school he goes to
B:	and uh, just loves Dick Vitelle, which not many people do.
B:	So, but he's reading it,
B:	and he's
B:	and he says, He's so interesting, Mom.
B:	You just can't believe all the things he's done.
B:	And he's really enjoying that.
B:	And I,
B:	and he said, Mom, you need to read it after I get finished.
B:	So maybe I will.
A:	There was, uh, I understand there was a really good basketball book called, uh, A SEASON ON THE BRINK.
B:	I never heard that one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm not sure.
A:	I don't know.
A:	I'm trying to think of the guy's name.
A:	It was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just heard about it the other night.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, I was listening to something on the radio about, uh,  you know, a talk show about sports books,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, and they mentioned that one.
B:	I'll have to tell my son about that.
B:	I'm sure he'd like it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I was thinking about,
A:	there was a, I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A, which,
B:	Oh, that would be good
A:	Yeah.
A:	I get in to, even when I don't like the sport so much, I get interested in the history of sports franchises or
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
B:	Uh, do you have any friends that have children?
A:	I do have friends that have children,
A:	yes.
B:	And what do they say about finding adequate child care?
A:	They,
B:	I think that may be the key word.
A:	I think that's correct.
A:	They're, uh, relatively nonexistent from, uh, from what I hear from my friends.
A:	It seems like, uh, even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word uh, still you have to deal with the people that, you know, happen to be operating it locally
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, it's just a matter of, of trust, you know,
A:	I think they feel that these people are, um, under qualified basically and underpaid,
A:	and I think that sort of goes hand in hand
A:	so it's, it's difficult for them.
B:	Well, we certainly found that to be true.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, indeed we've,
B:	our children are now eleven and nine.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things , like that. Uh, by that name. And found that, uh, more creative avenues were the right answer for us.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, at one point in time we've had au pairs, by trading services with them,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and that worked for a while,
B:	but they were really, adequate ones were really tough to find.
A:	I'm sure that's true.
B:	It takes that mixture of a very mature college student,  who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	I do have a friend that, uh, uh,
A:	she and her roommate became live-in care givers
A:	and they loved it.
A:	They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small, you know, four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school.
A:	And, uh, she was paid very well because they, the parents trusted them
A:	and they, you know, had done such a good job.
A:	So, um, I can see where someone, you know, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're, you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that.
B:	Well, that's true,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that's something that we're struggling with now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think it's just a matter of priorities.
A:	It's, uh, you know, it's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way,
A:	but you still have to be realistic, as well, I think.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that's, that's, that's bad to have to admit, too,
A:	but, uh, you know, it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home
A:	and, and I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children.
A:	I,
A:	it's just such a responsibility and, and when I've had friends that have said,
A:	when you hear people say, it, it alters your life forever, please take heed well,
A:	I realize that's true
A:	so it's, uh, such a responsibility.
B:	Well, it certainly is. Uh,
B:	if I can the other side of the coin for a moment.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It is such an honor and a thrill,  to be a parent,  that most of the time, it's worth it.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Yeah
A:	Most of the time
B:	Well, I just have to be honest about it.
B:	It's not always,  worth it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, sure.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
B:	There are those times when I think, gee, if I didn't have children I could be out playing bridge or golf.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	But, you know, it's funny.
A:	I did, I had a friend that said, you know, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other
A:	and she got older
A:	and she said, but you know, we never do those things anyway.
A:	So why why am I waiting, you know,
A:	it's, it's just the way your attitude changes
A:	and you mature I suppose.
A:	But the thing about the child care I, you know, I have friends that struggle financially and, and they both do have to work.
A:	It's a matter not necessarily, uh, that she might want to stay home or he, as well,
A:	but, you know, they need the money.
A:	And, uh, when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby, you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional it must be. And, and, you know, multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation , as far as child care, um,
A:	it's just a scary thing.
B:	Well, we were lucky when our children were that age,
B:	and having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	That's a big plus .
B:	And felt that, that ,  and feeling of safety.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And were leaving them small children.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But, we also learned something from that experience as our children got older.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's that care givers are not omniscient
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	they are not all things to all people or all children.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	I think it takes a,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I think your patient level must, needs to increase as the child gets older
A:	I think that might be part of the problem with some people. You know,
A:	taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,
A:	but when you have them in, their, their little feet are moving
A:	and you have to chase them down constantly.
A:	I'm sure that's a whole new ball game.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby .
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Well, you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about,
A:	since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them. fading in and
B:	Oh, you don't know what happens after they get in school.
A:	That's something altogether different, uh.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Now we have, uh, one takes piano lessons,  somewhere on one afternoon
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and the other one, of course can't do the same thing.
A:	Oh, of course not.
B:	It has to be somewhere else
B:	and no
B:	it's not adequate to sit and wait.
A:	You can't do that.
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	No.
A:	No.
B:	That just,
B:	that will not do.
A:	That's out of the question,
A:	I'm sure.
B:	Of course.
B:	But, we are helping, you know.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	We are being cooperative,
B:	what's wrong with you?
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	You don't understand this.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	That's just the way their minds work.
B:	And it's almost everyday.
A:	That's amazing.
A:	It's amazing that people actually,
A:	the stamina that you must, you know, draw from yourself to deal with it.
A:	It must be interesting.
A:	I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe.
B:	Well, I've been finding out that I really am a nice person.
B:	hit for many years.
B:	because I didn't need it.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And now, I need it.
A:	Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it stays low a lot
A:	Well, are your children now,
A:	do you feel comfortable, um, with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
A:	or,
B:	Absolutely not.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, one of them I would, I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's just a difference in kids, I suppose.
B:	That's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What,
B:	one leads the other?
A:	Huh-uh,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	and it's, it's the one that's going downhill,
A:	is it, is it the one that needs, needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one?
B:	Of course.
A:	Yeah
A:	How unfortunate
B:	You don't think, you don't think that good prevails.
A:	Well, I, I, I'm living in a dream world,
A:	what do I know.
A:	As I said, I don't have kids
A:	and I'm an only child
A:	so I've never been around children.
A:	So, uh, I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned.
A:	But I do hear my friends talk about it.
B:	We, we're having such fun,
B:	my wife and I were both only children.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends.
A:	Yeah
B:	Wrong.
A:	That's like World War Three every minute
A:	I don't know
A:	I, I, I have to admit, I was selfish as a child.
A:	I didn't want a brother or sister.
A:	And now that I'm older, of course, it's different.
A:	You know, I think about, uh, wouldn't it be nice,
A:	but, uh, anyway.
B:	Just make good friends.
A:	Yeah, oh,
A:	I have wonderful friends.
A:	That's true
A:	my best friend is one child of ten.
A:	And so they just sort of, you know, adopted me as their eleventh child
A:	so that worked out pretty well.
A:	She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,
A:	so I guess, that's an alternative.
A:	If you could just, um,  have a whole bunch
B:	Have enough.
A:	By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them.
B:	That's true.
A:	I don't know.
A:	When you see all these horror stories on television about child care
A:	and, gosh,
A:	I just,
A:	I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories
A:	and of course people are denying it.
A:	And, uh, it's just frightening.
A:	It really is.
B:	Well, what, what's frightening is a parent to see things that, that you don't really don't understand.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And then you don't really know what happened.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of, um, ribbon, you know, hair ribbon tied in a chair. Where obviously she had, had,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Do you have any pets now?
B:	Oh, I sure do,
B:	I have a cat and a dog named Joey.
A:	Joey,
A:	the dog is Joey?
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	The cat is,
B:	he's the little boy Pomeranian.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And we just got a new addition to the family, so to speak,
B:	we also have a fish.
A:	Oh, my
B:	It's a mud dog.
A:	I beg your pardon.
B:	It's a mud dog.
B:	It's, uh, a cross between a catfish and, uh, I don't know what, a salamander.
A:	Oh.
A:	Well did you all catch it,
A:	or, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	we have a cat, Stripper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, the mud dog.
A:	No,
A:	did,
A:	no
A:	did you catch the fish?
B:	Uh, we had a friend give it to us.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and it's all alone in that aquarium.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we'd like to get him a friend
B:	but um, uh, we haven't found one yet.
B:	So how about you,
B:	do you have any pets?
A:	Well at the present time I have two dogs.
B:	Oh really,
B:	what kind?
A:	An English setter, you know,
A:	that's the white dog with the feathers
A:	and it has, uh, yellow spots on it which they call, I think, uh, liver spots.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's a male.
A:	And I have a wonderful female lab, black lab.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	how long have you had them.
A:	Quite a long time, uh, probably five or six years
A:	and unfortunately the black lab that's a female, it, it's, it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had,
A:	an,
A:	when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having uh, problems limping and so forth
A:	and, she has hip dysplasia.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh no.
A:	And it's in that breed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But now I think there are tests that can be conducted, uh, to tell whether or not the puppies have the, have it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think,
A:	I don't know,
A:	apparently they've been so in, well I don't know inbred, or what,
A:	but,
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Well
A:	I'm not sure that's the situation,
A:	but, it, um,
A:	for those dogs that are registered
A:	and if, if you should have one, uh, that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it, uh.
B:	Huh,
B:	I had no idea,
B:	I hadn't, didn't even know that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	but she's wonderful.
B:	Um, our dog, Joey, has, uh, a back problem.
A:	Um, like
A:	what are the what are the symptoms?
B:	Uh, he, he's got a bad back
B:	but he's seven, uh,
B:	I guess he's almost eight years old.
B:	Um, he just, uh,
B:	he doesn't,
B:	he, uh, he rolls
B:	he doesn't like to roll over.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um,
B:	you just,
B:	when you touch him a certain way on the back,
A:	Yes.
B:	but otherwise, he can jump, uh, you know, just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way.
A:	Um. Well, uh, I have had just wonderful luck with this lab, uh,
A:	when
A:	uh, let's see, winter before last we would bring her in, and, uh, when it was cold.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she wouldn't,
A:	I, you know,
A:	the next morning you want to take them out,
A:	and she wouldn't,
A:	I couldn't get her up without picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds.
B:	I bet.
A:	Um, until,
A:	if I allowed her to not get up on her own, it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Anyway, I, uh, met my son's, uh, college roommate, is a vet
A:	and he said, um, let's give her some race horse shots.
A:	And you know in,
A:	I'm, I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this, but you, because you all the time, you know, run into people with problems.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Anyway, that's when we lived in Oklahoma,
A:	and, uh, so he gave this dog a series of ,
A:	it's,
A:	they give it to race horses, uh, to get rid of, uh cartilage,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's called .
A:	Anyway, it's a series of six shots, once a week,
A:	and then I noticed after two shots she was,
B:	Do you have to give those?
A:	Well I could have,
A:	but I can't give a shot.
B:	Oh, I
B:	believe me, I understand.
A:	I took her from Enid, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks.
B:	Uh.
A:	And, uh, after the, the second shot she was significantly better.
A:	Then I didn't notice any improvement till the, after the sixth one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And ever since,
A:	and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, I mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and when I notice in the winter, when it's worse, you know, it's cold weather and so forth then I have, uh, gotten a booster for her.
A:	But not many people in this part of the country know anything about .
B:	Um.
A:	I've had to get it from Oklahoma.
A:	They've heard about it
A:	but they've really never used it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I've never heard anything about it either.
A:	So dogs that get down in the hips,
A:	like I think German Shepherds do it, and probably large dogs.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it's just wonderful.
B:	Does he get,
B:	is he an inside dog also,
A:	Uh.
B:	or does he just run out in the backyard?
B:	Is he fenced in?
A:	Um, um, well we're living now in an area where we, we, we're in the woods
A:	and we take walks.
A:	I just don't let them, uh, uh, go away from me,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but we take walks through the woods twice a day.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	And, uh, I can over do it on her.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But anyway, at least she can go
A:	and she's not limping along and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Tell me about your cat.
B:	Oh, Stripper, well he started out being a little orphan,
B:	and we, we took him in
B:	and, uh, he's about two years old now
B:	and he loves his treats,
B:	uh, both, uh, Joey and, uh, Stripper get treats
B:	And, uh, let's see,
A:	And is, um, Stripper an inside cat, or outside?
B:	Oh, well he's outside
B:	and, uh, he's got a way to get in,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he's got free access of a window we like to keep open.
A:	Yes.
B:	So, he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to.
A:	Well of course.
A:	That's nice,
A:	they, they,
B:	Joey, on the other hand is a little different.
B:	He has to go out whenever, uh, we ask him
B:	and when he, when we ask him, he, uh, he barks.
B:	He'll either bark for food, or he'll bark to go out
B:	and he'll tell you which one he wants.
B:	He's been through obedience school.
A:	Well he just can,
A:	well he has been trained
A:	and you've you've kept it up, haven't you.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is wonderful,
A:	I, I have some neighbors across the field,
A:	and, um, they
A:	when we first moved here, uh, when the dogs and I didn't
A:	we have a very nice kennel and everything
A:	but, but since I, I didn't want to,
A:	I, I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I kept watch and never let them get away,
A:	but now every couple weeks, they one would slip away
A:	and my neighbor said to me, oh, I noticed those dogs, dogs are so well trained,
A:	anytime they hear your voice, they come.
A:	So that made me very proud
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Well, have we been talking five minutes?
B:	I'm not for sure.
A:	I'm not either,
A:	but,
B:	I think maybe we have,
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, um, so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure.
B:	Oh, definitely.
B:	Have you ever done this before?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh, okay, um,
B:	I haven't ever called.
B:	I've put in the paper work, I just never made the call.
A:	Oh really,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	they don't,
A:	no.
A:	I, I glanced at the clock when, um, we started
A:	and I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.
A:	But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening
A:	and I'm, I love gardening
A:	and she did too,
A:	an, and, after, after about twelve minutes or something, the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, well, at least you know you did your part.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	but it's been so much fun too, uh, talk.
B:	How did you get into this.
A:	Well, my best friend in Virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in Texas.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And so she knew that I had the time and would be, would enjoy it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's true.
A:	Um, so.
B:	I mean, I,
A:	But I have a hard time getting anybody, because I guess,
A:	do you work.
B:	Um, yes
B:	I do.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and probably just got home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, um, during the day, I
A:	I
A:	and I understand also they want men.
B:	Right,
B:	I was going to tell you the same thing.
B:	They're really looking for a lot more men to participate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my husband does.
B:	Does he.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I need to,
A:	Yes.
B:	I've got some applications,
B:	I need to hand them out.
B:	But, uh, this is a great project, that they're working on
B:	and it's really going to lead the way, uh, for a lot of um, applications and, and development in the voice area.
A:	Yes,
A:	I think so too,
A:	and I haven't helped them out on the on men particularly,
A:	but my husband had been in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I try to, you know, make them do, during the day,
A:	but nobody's home.
B:	Well this is the perfect time for me.
A:	Well good.
B:	Well maybe I'll get you next time.
A:	Yeah
A:	it so much fun to talk to you.
B:	All right,
B:	have a good one.
A:	You too,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party I, depending on the number of people, I might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,
A:	and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.
B:	Oh, that sounds good.
A:	So that makes,
B:	Uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.
B:	Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna,
B:	and I used my mother's recipe,
B:	I really like it.
B:	It's got, um,
B:	you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it
B:	and, I'm not sure she even puts,
B:	must be some Italian spices in there.
B:	I can't remember.
B:	But, um, for the cheese part, you mix, uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese and, uh, layer all that.
A:	Well, that sounds good.
B:	It's good.
A:	That sounds good.
B:	And, then, uh, uh, tossed salad and, and, um, someone in the Oh,
B:	my goodness, Diane, get down from there.
B:	to And, uh, let's see,
B:	what else did I serve with that.
A:	Bread, do you have bread to go with it?
B:	Corn,
B:	yeah,
B:	I made French bread with that one too.
A:	Gosh.
B:	I have a recipe that's pretty good for that
B:	So.
A:	Oh, well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on the cooking for lasagna,
A:	they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna.
B:	I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna
A:	So.
B:	in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once.
A:	Did you?
B:	It was good.
A:	Well, I, I know people that have, have served it
A:	and they say, gosh, if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy,
B:	Easy
A:	and she said it's, they said it's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, that, that's always sounds good to me, um,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I feel like, I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot.
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always for company, just for, just for family.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.
B:	Not my favorite place, but. A necessity
A:	But a time consuming place.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	right,
A:	so.
B:	Let's see,
B:	what else do we like to have for,
B:	trying to think what else I like to serve.
B:	My mother likes to serve taco grandes.
B:	Have you ever had,   that?
A:	I don't know,
A:	what that is.
A:	No
A:	I don't know what that is.
B:	You take a flour tortilla
B:	and you fry it like a taco shell
A:	Okay.
A:	Right.
B:	and you, uh,
B:	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,
B:	and, and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor
B:	so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	And, then, um, let's see,
B:	and then, and you heat up refried beans,
B:	and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese,
B:	and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first,
B:	then you put the meat,
B:	then you put the grated cheese,
B:	and then you put, um,
B:	let's see, what's next,
B:	then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the, um, lettuce,
A:	Right.
B:	and you can put, uh, like guacamole and someone in the
B:	Katy, I'm on the phone.
B:	Well, get a towel or go change.
B:	I'm on the phone.
B:	to Um, oh a little sour cream is good and, and chopped olives,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Do you like to make your own guacamole?
B:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we don't make it very often, I guess,
A:	but, uh,
B:	No,
B:	I don't very often.
B:	Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain
A:	Oh do they?
B:	so. Yeah.
A:	Gosh,
B:	I just cut slices off
B:	and. I like an avocado sandwich, too.
A:	Gosh,
A:	Oh, that's good,
A:	that's good,
A:	or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Oh, well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day,
A:	and, and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad.
B:	off What you want.
B:	to where do they get it?
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	I guess they don't have it at home,
B:	I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to,
B:	I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.
A:	They must, they just said they never had it at home.
A:	So I, I was concerned that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so I just,
B:	It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.
A:	Oh, does that help?
B:	Yeah,
B:	if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.
A:	Okay,
A:	well,
B:	That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.
A:	Well, I'll have to remember that.
A:	Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top
A:	and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would,
B:	Oh.
A:	so.
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	I thought maybe that was the trick.
B:	That probably helps, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	so. Oh, well. I guess we bought a lot of,
A:	we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef,
A:	so
B:	Do you want it?
A:	even though, you know,
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	we have too,
A:	the ground turkey, it's, the meat is softer
A:	and I,
A:	everybody seems to like it.
B:	Do you want scrambled?
A:	So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper, too,
A:	so we often buy it
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	we buy it,
B:	if you get it on sale,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	so we bought that
A:	or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,
A:	and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	Or in,
B:	I don't think mine know either.
B:	In fact, we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey, too.
B:	It costs less than the other,
B:	I don't know,
B:	there's supposed to be something more healthy about it
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Poultry instead of the beef and pork,
B:	yeah
A:	right,
A:	right.
A:	Well, I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve. Um,
A:	I always like dessert
B:	One salad that we always like, my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners, is a,
B:	I don't know what you call it.
B:	Uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like Cool Whip
A:	Right,
A:	right
B:	that's good and quick and easy,
A:	that's always good,
A:	Probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,
A:	and we take a recipe from my grandmother, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's probably fairly typical, cream cheese and egg and sugar, and the insides of a,
A:	Well, this is the season for vacations.
A:	And, uh, I guess for places I like to go, I enjoy going to the beach and having, having outdoor, being outdoors somewhere.
A:	Someplace that's very different than Texas.
B:	Right.
A:	And I,
A:	as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot. And being able to be outside, enjoy outside activities,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Enjoy going places where,
A:	I enjoy playing tennis,
A:	so I like to have a tennis court there,
A:	or, or if it's at the beach, the beach is great.
A:	A pool is great.
A:	And, I ,
B:	Where, where do you usually go?
A:	Oh, well, let's see,
A:	we have plans this year to drive up to the, uh, to Colorado.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, we will be going to Estes Park, and Colorado Springs,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado, into Durango and north of the area there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I,
A:	boy that's a nice, a nice place to visit.
A:	It's really nice at,
A:	there's a nice, nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, and then actually, north, north of that is another town and, a smaller, on a smaller scale, I guess, than Silverton.
A:	But, I, and then there's lots and lots of real, of mountains that are covered with, uh, boulders.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I guess people Jeep through that area
A:	and we did not have a chance to do that.
A:	But, I sure would like to go back there and do that again.
B:	Right.
B:	We are, uh, we have not had a vacation in several years,
B:	so, be our first chance in awhile, uh,
B:	we are going to go to, uh, Destin, Florida, which is a very nice beach area, if you are not familiar with it.
A:	I have not been,
A:	but I have heard it's wonderful.
B:	Oh, it's, it's gorgeous.
B:	Uh, we used to go quite a bit, uh, before I moved out here.
B:	We were closer and, uh, used to go almost every summer, uh, and, rent a condo there on the beach.
B:	Uh, there's quite a few, uh, there's a lot of development of, of condominiums there on the beach front.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, so they have, uh, they are very, very large condos.
B:	And, they have quite a few rooms, and, uh, so we, we will usually rent one for about a week or so.
B:	And,
A:	Right,
A:	and the, beach is nice,
B:	go down.
B:	Oh.
A:	the beach is really nice, isn't it.
B:	Yes,
B:	it's, uh, it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, and a, lot of nice waves usually, uh,
A:	Oh.
A:	Sea shells.
B:	enough, enough to make it.
B:	I am sorry.
A:	Sea shells.
B:	Uh, there's not as many sea shells along there, uh,
B:	that's the only thing that they really do not,
B:	they have some, but not, not so much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, if you go further down, uh, you will usually find some, but not right in there.
B:	Uh, I do not know why it is,
B:	but, uh, it just,
B:	it seems not, it seems not to have as many there, right there.
B:	But, uh, we, we enjoy it, uh,
B:	it's,
B:	the place where we stay is, we usually stay at the same place every year,
B:	and they are, like I say right on the beach.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, where do you stay?
A:	My husband always wants to go to Destin,
A:	we just have not gone that direction yet.
B:	It's a place called Jetty East, uh, J E T T Y E A S T,
B:	and it's, uh, called that because it's at the very end of, uh, a jetty there, which is, uh, sort of at the end of this little, little point
A:	Okay.
B:	and, uh, it's a, at the very end,
B:	it's the last set of condominiums there,
B:	and it's, uh, it's very nice. Uh,
B:	it's not very expensive, uh,
B:	you can,
B:	I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids.
B:	And, uh, they have a, we have a, uh, I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, uh, condominium, which will sleep, I do not know, quite a few about , six or eight. And, uh, cause it's got, you know, pull out couches and all that,
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three hundred dollars for the week.
A:	Oh. That's nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is,
B:	because, uh, the, uh, you know, it has got its own kitchen, full size, kitchen and everything.
A:	Great.
B:	And, this one, I think has two baths,
B:	and it's,
B:	the one we got is on the, on the beach side.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, nice.
B:	We have got a beautiful view and balcony,
B:	and, uh, just,
B:	you know, it's really a nice stay. Uh,
B:	in fact, we stayed there on our honeymoon,
B:	we, I had won a trip to the Bahamas, but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time,
B:	so we instead went there, uh, and loved it just as much as, as if we had gone to the Bahamas.
B:	We, in fact, we stayed an extra day or so, because we liked
A:	Oh.
B:	the, uh, the particular uh, uh, uh, suite we had gotten was very nice
B:	and, so we decided to stay.
A:	Great.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, uh, it's a pretty nice place,
B:	you will need to try to go and, stay there sometime.
A:	Well, we have just we have just,
B:	It's a little far from here,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Are you driving?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we are.
B:	We are,
B:	it will take, uh, a day and a half to get there, probably.
A:	Oh.
B:	So.
A:	Well, we are,
A:	the neighborhood that we live, they are switching to an alternate calendar this year,
A:	so it,
A:	starting, well, starting at the end of July, we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family.
A:	So, I,
B:	Uh, what does, what does that mean, alternate?
A:	Well, it's,
A:	what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation, nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, in, and in the summer would be more like a two month, two month break.
B:	Right.
A:	So, and they hope to boost the, they hope to boost the learning of the children. Just the retention of the material for them.
B:	I see.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Kind of scattering the vacation out, throughout the year.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah.
A:	So, it's
A:	so, anyway, so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls
B:	Right.
A:	We will head for, we will head for Florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.
B:	Right.
A:	So, uh.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well, that's probably all we need to do today.
B:	Okay.
A:	Alright.
B:	So long.
A:	Thanks a lot.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right
A:	and, and your occupation is teaching?
B:	I'm a, I'm a substitute teacher.
A:	Substitute teacher.
B:	Is, is this Pat I'm talking to now?
A:	Yes,
A:	it is, it is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm a substitute teacher, in, I believe, the same school system we both work in.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I was just trying to make an introduction, here
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But, oh, and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year, now.
B:	Oh.
A:	I've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at Barron.
B:	Well, I bet you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.
A:	Right.
A:	I,
A:	well, not really.
A:	I've got the, every day I've got to, uh, read to kindergartners,
A:	so I'm going to be down on the floor with them.
A:	I've got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be doing, working with every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.
A:	So I'll be, I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I'm, I'm, if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them, I'm not going to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.
B:	Well, What I wear sometimes depends on, on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to. And always carry a sweater.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold
B:	Yes.
A:	But, you don't know, uh, I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there.
B:	No,
B:	you try to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.
A:	Subtract.
A:	Right.
B:	And it's, it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,
A:	I, I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools.
A:	That's one of things, one of the things I ask about, you know, whether, whether she would allow slacks
A:	and she said she doesn't have a problem with that,
A:	she just didn't like sloppy dressing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and I said, well, you know, that was okay.
A:	And I'm,
A:	basically, I just, you know, I wear slacks year round except every, about once a week I try to wear a skirt.
A:	And, and in the winter, you know, I just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer. And add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's about,
A:	I don't, I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and, you know, look really,
B:	Right,
B:	and, well, for me sometimes, they even have dress up days
B:	or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits
A:	Yeah
B:	and you have to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose to participate in spirit week.
A:	Right.
B:	And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat.
A:	And you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in, do you?
B:	No,
B:	but because I sort of stick to several schools, uh, I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember to do it.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And then many schools on a particular day during, uh, I guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day which,
A:	Right.
A:	On what, Thursday.
B:	Right,
B:	it might be Thursday for the high schools
B:	and it may be Friday for the senior high schools.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	So that would kind of give you a, a clue, I guess
A:	and, and sometimes you get the long term stuff
A:	so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That,
A:	so that's,
A:	and I don't know, you know,
A:	I, I think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know.
A:	Are
A:	they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have to, the men have to wear ties
A:	and there can be no blue jeans worn
A:	and, because some of the teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.
A:	And, and, uh, I don't know that that looks that bad.
A:	But, if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it,
B:	I see that the,
B:	I think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it, I think it varies, it, it just so much.
B:	Anything, anything can go.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.
B:	But they're just sort of into clothes,
B:	and then there's other departments that aren't.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's a couple teachers up there that, that do dress up more than others.
B:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there,
B:	you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, and you always,
A:	course, it's a standing joke, you know, when the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat, you say, you know, what, have you got a job interview today
A:	or, there, there's, There's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and would, would, uh, cause that to happen
B:	Or you're going to be observed.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I, I don't know how a coach would feel if, that teaches health or you know, English, or whatever that they had to wear a tie.
A:	I,
A:	some of those male coaches, that might really,
B:	Right.
B:	They go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants.
A:	Right,
A:	and a T-shirt.
A:	Right.
A:	That I didn't ever understand.
A:	I mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period
A:	so
B:	Yeah,
B:	well at Vines, the coaches don't do that.
A:	Whether,
B:	They, they dress pretty good, I would say
B:	and then they go to their coaching
B:	and they, they put their shorts on there.
A:	Change then.
A:	Well, see, that's what I would think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's what I would think.
B:	But, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or, or anything.
B:	They're, they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation, not in P E.
A:	Right.
A:	Course, we had, had one coach, one period he'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E
B:	Those I can understand.
A:	and, and that's hard.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, so he just left warm-ups on,
A:	but, but, uh, no,
A:	I think, really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,
A:	and I don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,
A:	I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top
A:	and,
B:	I don't think we'll ever get to that.
A:	You don't think so.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think.
B:	I think we're going the opposite direction.
B:	It's the parochial schools that I guess many
B:	they've had uniforms for years,
B:	I don't really know if they still do.
A:	Well, some of them, yes they do
A:	and, and it's not at some of the private schools,
B:	It certainly makes it easier to dress.
A:	but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where, where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers, you know, dress in accordance with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, I think, that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well I, I think it would make a difference at school.
A:	I, I don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing too shorts, too short
A:	or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high, you know,
A:	I mean it's a lot of trouble to, to take care of that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, of course, the kids say, then why bother, just let me wear what I want.
A:	And, and yet we can't to that either.
A:	I'd like to see them go to, to not necessarily a uniform, but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt. You know,
A:	that would, that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them.
A:	But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I doubt that that would come that that will come about.
A:	And then the girls,
B:	Just
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I,
A:	I don't,
A:	no,
A:	not in Plano.
B:	No
B:	not,
A:	They may get
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there.
B:	Well, I think it does.
B:	It, it takes their minds off of, of trying to compete.
A:	Highland Park's thinking about going that route.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it,
A:	and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree with you on,
A:	Hi,
A:	good morning.
B:	Good morning.
A:	Do you have recycling in Sachse?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
B:	We've  got, uh, a pickup twice a week that they come out
A:	Do,
B:	and, they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody
B:	and they take it.
A:	Oh really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's twice a week?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Really?
A:	We have, recently started, uh, a bin program here in Plano where, uh,
A:	used to be we, we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up.
A:	And now they have, uh, these large green containers
A:	and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there.
A:	And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet,
A:	but they're, but they're planning on doing it very soon.
A:	Apparently the trucks that they had, um, lined up, they needed the parts for, Saudi Arabia
B:	Oh.
A:	And so that put off the program for a while.
A:	But, uh, do you recycle?
B:	Um, my kids do
A:	Do they?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Put it that way.
B:	They, they've been recycling cans for extra money.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's, that's been their summer money
B:	and they're fixing to go to Disneyland.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, well
B:	So,
A:	that's great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well that's the way we started too.
A:	My daughter was going, to Camp Goddard, um, which is through the Plano school system, you know in the fall  couple of years ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she had to earn money for it
A:	and she was too young to baby-sit.
A:	So, that's how she started.
A:	She started recycling cans
A:	and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and, uh, aluminum cans and plastics.
B:	Really?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Is, is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go
B:	and they, weigh it or whatever
B:	and,
A:	No,
A:	the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling.
A:	And so, you know, we don't get paid for that
A:	but that's okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, it's, it's not that much of a bother really.
A:	You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever
A:	and we use a lot of, two liter bottles. Um, and like milk cartons and things like that.
A:	It's amazing how much plastic you generate.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was amazed at how many cans  that we got
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	because when the kids first went down, I said, that, you know that's great
B:	and I was thinking, you know maybe I'd help supplement it, you know when they turned them in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's amazing how many cans you go through.  And how fast they accumulate.
A:	Yeah
A:	it really is.
A:	Well all that stuff
A:	and how much, how much we have reduced our waste.  You know, that we, we're generating a week.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I know our neighbors, when we first went to this bin program said, oh, there's no way, you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week.
A:	They were real upset
A:	but they weren't, they were only picking up once a week.
A:	And we said to them, if you recycle, you'll, you know, you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, it's, it's really amazing.
A:	The other thing he does, that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings.
B:	Really.
A:	No.
A:	He, he got a little mulcher thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower
A:	and we mow once a week.
A:	You know, no, no more often then that.
A:	And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the, on, on, the, uh, the lawn.
A:	And it's amazing,
A:	it's amazing.
A:	We don't collect any of that
A:	and that, that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we don't we don't catch it either, mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard.
B:	So, if it mows, gets mowed, I do it normally.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it.
B:	It's too heavy.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I just I just mow it and leave it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It just soaks in.
A:	Sure it does.
A:	Sure it does.
A:	It really does
A:	and it,
A:	actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not, uh, if you're catching your grass clippings.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That, that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn.
A:	It's amazing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, I like it better doing it.
B:	Well one,
B:	it cuts down on my mow time anyway
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's true.
B:	and you zip through it quicker.
A:	That's true.
A:	That's true.
A:	Well, I, I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it.
B:	we probably will.
A:	It's, it's really not that much trouble.
A:	We keep a large plastic, uh, just a, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And as soon as we use something, you know, we crush it up and put it out there
A:	and then, you know, every few weeks we have recycling, a recycling center like near Wal-Mart.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're, they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in
A:	and it's really no trouble.
A:	And, uh, I feel like at least we're doing something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, , um, I read a book one time or a a magazine article
A:	and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution, it seems like a small contribution
A:	but it's not.
A:	If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.
B:	Really.
A:	And, uh, when you read that you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.
B:	What, what makes me sick is, is when they show the dump sites  you know, and, and, how big they are.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or like in New York, the barges that that go up and down the, the river
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they don't have any place to put it
B:	and it just floats in the ,
B:	it's like ugh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	And that's, and that's really not necessary.
B:	No.
A:	It really isn't
A:	if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference.
A:	It would make a huge impact.
A:	So, I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano
A:	I, I, can't wait for them to get it started. Um, because it'll be that much easier for us,
A:	you know, like I said, now we have to take it over to, to Wal-Mart.
A:	It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, it's  it's convenient out here for them to do it.
A:	Um
A:	Now what, what do they pick up?
A:	It's just,
B:	They pick up the, the plastic, the glass, and the newspaper.
A:	Oh they do?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And do you have to sort that?
B:	And they will do the
A:	Or do you just put it all in.
B:	No,
B:	you just put it in the one bin
B:	and, and I guess they do the sorting.
B:	But, um, they'll do the aluminum cans too
B:	but we don't give them those
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	The kids keep those
B:	So,
A:	So you're doing that now?
A:	You're doing the newspapers and the glass?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well  we don't, we don't take the newspaper to begin with. When, neither one of us are home  to read it.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we don't have the newspapers but the, the plastic and the glass
B:	At first, when it first started, it, it, it was hard. You know, because you're just used to throwing things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My husband would, come home and go through the trash and say, you threw this away
B:	Uh!
A:	He would get, he would get all upset
A:	and I'd say,
A:	it's just such an automatic reaction.
A:	And now  we think before we throw anything away.
B:	It is.
A:	I mean, it's really funny.
A:	We, we really,
A:	once you get into the habit of it, it's okay,
A:	it's just, it's just making it a habit that's hard
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	Well the kids have even got to the point where they, if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can, you know, they, they're, oh, no, don't do that
B:	and they go to the sink, they rinse them out, and they put them upside down, they let them drain
B:	and and then, uh, after a couple of days they take them all outside
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, I put them in a big bag anyway
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then they dump the bag out
B:	and then they crush them.
B:	So that's  their activity thing. To go out there and crush.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's fun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	So,
A:	yeah.
A:	Oh, that's a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's a lot of fun.
A:	Well, that's great.
A:	Well I'm to hear you're, doing that.
A:	I,
A:	my sister was here recently from Connecticut
A:	and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.
B:	Oh really?
A:	Okay. Um,
B:	Where do you live?
A:	In Plano.
B:	In Plano?
A:	Yes.
A:	Where do you live?
B:	In Dallas.
A:	Oh, okay
B:	Uh, the air pollution isn't too bad in our area.
B:	So, we're very fortunate but I know in some areas, it's really, it, it really is bad.
A:	Huh
A:	Um, I was trying to think, uh,
A:	something we were watching the other day
A:	and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles, uh, from an area that was up higher
A:	and you literally could see the band of smog.
A:	That, uh,
A:	I've never been out there,
A:	but, it was, it was quite evident that, it was a real brown area
B:	I haven't either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Well, I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
B:	and, unfortunately, I think there are a lot of areas that are, that, that bad.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Particularly in the areas where there are industries, uh, where they are burning a lot of coal,  and oil  up, more up north, I guess, uh,
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah
B:	I think it's a bigger problem. With the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,
B:	I think, uh, air isn't as bad it once was, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, I know, uh, that's been the concern in Europe.
A:	They hadn't,
A:	uh, we have friends in Germany and, uh, have family that live near the Black Forest area
A:	and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we, uh, switched to the unleaded gas and, and had the emission control advice, uh, devices required on the cars, uh,
A:	that's something that Europe didn't do right away
A:	and now they're doing that
A:	and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country, that's the only pollution that's been there.
A:	It's not an area that is industry
A:	but they were losing a lot of, uh, trees and a lot of,
B:	From acid rain?
A:	Um, I guess. From, from something that the car was, uh, was giving,
B:	I think it gives off, uh, in the emissions, it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere, uh, and form a, a weak acid.
A:	Yes,
A:	and,
B:	It just makes the rain fall on the acid side
B:	and after a period of time, I think that accumulates in, uh, trees because they take it up through their roots, as well as it landing on the leaves, on surfaces,
B:	like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What's interesting, several years ago, I took a course, uh, on, uh, well,
B:	it was actually, it was put on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was,
B:	and there wasn't from various kinds of, of energy.
B:	And, uh, at that point in time, one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain
B:	and it was kind of pooh-poohed, you know.
B:	Oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing.
B:	And it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage.
B:	So, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course.
B:	Now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.
B:	Uh, I'm not afraid of nuclear, having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use is not bomb quality,
B:	and, we're so strict with all our controls in the United States. The chances of, of an accident are slight,
B:	and, it doesn't pollute the air at all.
B:	It's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant.
B:	Many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.
B:	It's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear.
A:	Yes.
B:	So, I don't know.
B:	In Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power
B:	and they recycle the fuel
B:	and then instead of, of,
B:	some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality.
B:	But, that's the only sensible thing to do, is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground. As far as I'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, uh, pollute the groundwater.
B:	So, I don't know what the answer is.
B:	The best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, we've got a problem on the line, don't we.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I get that sometimes, um,
A:	my line gets some static.
A:	I don't know why.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, solar, of course, would be the clean, the cleanest.
A:	Well, I know it's , um,
A:	we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston
A:	and, uh, oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal.
B:	I can't hear you at all for all this static.
A:	Oh. I don't know what to,
A:	usually it's the other phone I have trouble with.
A:	It must just, be on the line.
A:	Can you hear me?
B:	Now I can again.
A:	Okay.
A:	I don't know what, uh, I, I don't know what the problem is
A:	but, uh, when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater
A:	and  we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
A:	and we have enough clouds that, uh, there are other areas that would be better suited.
A:	That surprised me because I think, we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and it,
A:	yes,
A:	it can be used
A:	and it can help
A:	but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working on.
A:	But,
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	It, it's still got a long way to go.
A:	Well I,
B:	It's just, you know, a possible solution in the future, I think, maybe to help in some ways.
A:	Yes.
B:	It may not in all ways.
B:	Maybe they'll come up with fusion. You know, be able to control it.
B:	I don't know how long that'll take,
B:	but, one of these days,
B:	because that's perfectly clean.
A:	Yes.
B:	It's just we can't control it.
B:	Right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out,
B:	so, it isn't, not at all,
B:	and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,
B:	so that's not going to work. At least not now.
B:	But, uh, who knows what the future will hold. Uh, as far as energy goes,
B:	I, I think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.
A:	Uh, I hope so
B:	I do to.
B:	I like to be optimistic,
B:	I don't like to be pessimistic about these things.
A:	Well, I do think, um,
A:	I mean, you've already mentioned several things, I think, uh, just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in, uh,
B:	We have one earth, to live on
A:	Yes
B:	and we got to take care of it.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well,  and, and for the future generations, too. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've noticed students are, are much more, you know, young, young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment  and protecting the earth.
A:	Yes.
B:	And so, if we can raise it, uh, you know, generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems.
B:	I'm afraid,
B:	I know I was part of the me generation where they didn't, so many of them didn't, people didn't care.
B:	You know,
B:	it's whatever, you know,
B:	recycle, well, if it's a problem, forget that.
B:	Uh, not throw the trash out the car window
B:	and leave it in the car and then throw it away?
B:	How horrible, you know.
B:	Now, I've always done those kinds of things because I just didn't like messes,
B:	and fade ...
B:	So, how do you feel about capital punishment?
A:	Well, it's,
A:	I am pretty much against it
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	How about you?
B:	Oh, I'm pretty much for it.
A:	Oh, good
A:	we can have a debate.
B:	We'll have some interesting discussion, I guess.
A:	Well, like, um, I don't know,
A:	I think that I,
A:	one of the reasons that I'm against it is that, uh, um, I'm afraid of someone losing their life, for um, wrongly,
B:	Wrongfully.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, another reason,
A:	one of the arguments, that really, I really actually have been kind of ambivalent about it, but one of the arguments that really, uh, made me feel kind of strongly against it, is that, uh, you know, someone said to me once, well, imagine if the person you love most in the world, like your mother or something, if someone killed her, wouldn't you want to see them killed for the punishment?
A:	But then I thought about it
A:	and I thought, well, the loss that I would feel at losing my mother   someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were, somebody loves them
B:	Yeah,
B:	it would never be equal,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, I guess, you know, I, I guess I can see it from several different perspectives,
B:	but, you know when I hear about things like, you know, what they've, what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee, you know I, I, to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy.
B:	You know, maybe there is, I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	But, you know, and, you know, he's never going to be, to me, a functioning part of society.
B:	He's already been either paroled, or whatever, for child molestation.
A:	Uh-hum.
B:	I mean, I don't know,
B:	I just, I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko.
B:	And, you know, for the things he's done,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I guess it's either, you know, put him in jail for the rest of his life, you know, or or capital punishment I guess. You know
A:	Right.
A:	Well you know  that's true, because um a lot of um these conversations I've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around um criminal you know justice.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or whatever
A:	and most of the time I hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails
A:	and people crime is still climbing
A:	and we need to have different punishments you know.
B:	Right.
A:	but I just am scared of capital punishment, I guess.
B:	I I mean you know there there is always that chance
B:	but you know I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I don't I mean I don't know
B:	but uh, you know, but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be, you know
B:	you you you really throw a lot on the courts, hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really.
B:	But, uh, you know, when I, you find somebody just like that situation, I mean, it was disgusting when I read about it today.
B:	And, and when you find someone like that, that you know is guilty, he confessed already to killing eleven I, I'd, you know, I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and
A:	Right.
A:	Especially when it's so far removed.
A:	If it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	And trying to rehabilitate him, too,
B:	and, you know,
A:	Letting him out again
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
B:	And, uh, you know, nobody wants that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, everybody would be just as scared to death, you know.
B:	We, we've had a real problem here in Texas with, uh, prison overcrowding
B:	and they've been releasing people left and right
B:	and, you know, they've committed murders and rapes and everything else,
B:	and, you know, you just think, you know, where's the justice here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you know, they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving.
A:	That's true.
A:	You know, I just recently moved to Massachusetts.
A:	I'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment
A:	and that was one of the questions
A:	but, uh, I do know that they are notorious for paroling people.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	when they're, when,
A:	and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, I guess, they said, you know, do you think it should be restricted?
A:	I guess, if it were, if, if,
A:	because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, violent crimes with no, uh, with just malicious intent.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, that's exactly, I mean, I'm, I'm not saying I, I think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know
B:	and I, I think there's a, a shadow of a doubt, you know, like with this, this guy in, in Milwaukee.
B:	I mean, it,
B:	he pretty much confessed to it.
B:	I mean, they, you know,
B:	just everything, I mean, cannibalism and everything else, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Hang?
B:	Because, I mean, that's just awful.
A:	And what is he going to do prison to the other people
B:	Right.
B:	Well, I have a I have a hunch that, you know, the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway. Either,
B:	I mean, you know they,
B:	I don't know,
B:	from, from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, I don't know. It's just,
A:	Well, I was, I saw on a human interest story, or whatever today, there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back,
A:	she was off drugs and everything,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she said, uh, you know, in prison you can get anything.
A:	You can any drugs you want.
A:	There's,
A:	it, it's just like being outside.
A:	You know, people  find ways around.
B:	Really.
A:	And there's a power structure that you have bow to
A:	and, and, it really isn't, for some people who have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, uh, as bad.
A:	I mean, there's,
A:	it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
A:	and  maybe that's why, one of the reasons why crime has gone up, because it's not so scary anymore.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, especially like repeat offenders.
B:	It, it just appalls me that they can be out, you know, they even get a ten year sentence and be out in, in two, or three, or four years.
B:	You know, that's, that's scary because, you know, I'm not sure, I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're, you know, going to be committing any more violent acts or not.
A:	Right.
A:	And what they're going to be doing when they get out
B:	Right.
B:	And, it, it's, it's really scary
B:	I you know,
B:	I, I don't know what the perfect solution to that is
B:	but I know that especially with violent crimes where, you know, you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else, you know, then, I don't know, I, I guess, I, I just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee, you know.
B:	For instance, I mean, that's just,
B:	I could see capital punishment in a case like that. And, you know, for, for other people, too, that do things, like that.
B:	But, uh, when,
B:	uh, my wife and I are both participating in this survey
B:	and she picked up the phone
B:	and when she heard the topic, she said, capital punishment,
B:	so she was, uh,
A:	Handed it to you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well luckily it was for me. Because they want, they coordinate the times so it can, only be one or the other.
A:	Oh, oh, I see.
B:	So, she tried to enter her number
B:	and it wouldn't work
B:	so she said, whew, it's for you.
B:	So, but, uh, you know, I don't know,
B:	I, I struggle with it,
B:	but I, I really think that in, in terms of like this, I'd, I think that it, it might not be such a bad thing. Because, I don't know that anybody, I don't know that anybody would feel good, you know, like if you let someone like that loose in your community.
B:	You know, I, I, I'm
B:	you'd have to be scared to death
A:	Well, maybe if they could, uh,
A:	if they had more money or more, more resources to work more on rehabilitation,
A:	I mean, deep down I think every, every human
A:	Okay,
A:	do you subscribe to magazines yourself?
B:	I don't, uh, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, uh, I need to read that, uh, I just don't take any at home.
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	I get, uh, MCCALL'S.
A:	Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work What I enjoy about staying home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I read magazines mainly because they're fast
A:	and if I want to relax while I watch T V,
A:	of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once,
A:	and, uh, I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S.
A:	And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.
B:	Right.
B:	I I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then you stopped them all.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	the subscriptions ran out
B:	and I never renewed them.
B:	And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to read them.
A:	I find that, uh, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when, uh, when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with uh, on a general basis,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we travel a lot
A:	so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And I get into, uh, newspapers,
A:	so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am.
A:	I'm, read it fast and put it down
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	When, when I had my magazines at home, I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,
B:	and if something caught my eye, then I might read something,
A:	Right.
B:	but otherwise than that, you know, they were, uh, you know, not too useful to me. You know
A:	Well, That's what I do.
B:	I got some good recipes from them sometimes,
B:	but
A:	You clip recipes
A:	and you save them forever
A:	and you never really use them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	And then every so often you weed through them
A:	and you think, where did I ever put that recipe.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, that's mainly my, uh, whole idea on you know, short subject, uh, reading and things like this.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I subscribe, like I said, to a few
A:	and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, pertains to my daily life at the present time.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, since I work with computers during my work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.
B:	And I have to read the magazines, you know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these, uh, magazines such as that,
B:	so I really, you know, just,
B:	I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, sometimes, if, you know, if you're in transportation, in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But I think,
A:	and the idea is to, is and good,
A:	I can just dump them at the other end
A:	and I don't have to carry them back with me.
B:	That's right.
A:	I do that when we travel.
A:	I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	If I, if I go on an airplane ride or something, I'll stop in and pick up a, you know, a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane.
A:	Right,
A:	although now,
B:	But, uh, you know, that's basically just about
B:	I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then
A:	That's when you really have time.
A:	Now see your computer ones,
A:	I got into computer work somewhat, uh,
A:	we have our own computer system at home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I tried, uh, reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it
A:	and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what I needed,
A:	so I never did get into them.
A:	I when I bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.
A:	I think they all thought, well, we have a live one She'll subscribe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But they were wrong.
A:	I never got into them.
A:	But, but, Okay?
B:	Right.
A:	All right, I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point.
B:	Okay.
A:	It was nice talking with you.
B:	It was nice to talk with you, too.
A:	Okay.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Bye, now.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Do you have any hobbies?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	What are yours?
B:	China painting and ceramics.
A:	Ooh, how great.
B:	I enjoy it.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Oh, uh, ceramic painting.
B:	I enjoy the china more.
A:	The china more.
B:	And now that I have my eyes, corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting, I do enjoy it.
A:	How did you ever get into that?
A:	That sounds so interesting.
B:	My husband kept begging me,
B:	and he's been dead now for twenty years,
B:	so you understand that this was a long time ago.
B:	But he finally brought me the china, the book, the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons.
A:	How
A:	I,
B:	And I said I'll do it for three months
B:	and if I don't like it, that's it.
B:	Well, I painted an awful lot until his death, which was several years.
B:	And it has just been the most relaxing, enjoyable self-satisfying thing I've had.
B:	I,
A:	Now, do you do it just for yourself,
A:	or do you do it to give as gifts,
A:	or do you actually sell it?
B:	I have sold quite a bit.
B:	I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home
B:	and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that sounds
A:	now, do you work outside of the home?
B:	I have just retired.
A:	You've just retired.
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, oh, what a great hobby
B:	No,
B:	it's not,
A:	I,
B:	It's a great hobby,
B:	but don't retire
A:	Don't retire.
B:	Oh,
A:	Well, see, I don't,
A:	I never, uh, returned to work for the
A:	I have stayed home for about the last nine years.
B:	Oh, have, well,
A:	We've transferred around,
A:	and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake, uh, on Lake Erie.
A:	So the lake life appealed to me,
A:	and my husband's working
A:	and he left it up to me if I worked or not.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, in my spare time, I love to sew.
A:	There aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing,
A:	but I do make all my own clothes
A:	and we recently purchased a new home,
A:	so I enjoy doing my, uh, toppers for my window applications and things like that.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby, yours sounds great
B:	Well, my sister is the seamstress of the two of us.
B:	And, but she doesn't china paint
B:	so we both have our expertise side.
A:	That is excellent.
B:	What part of Ohio are you in?
A:	We're in the I'm in the suburb of Cleveland
A:	and I'm about, uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown Cleveland, something like that.
A:	And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie
A:	and prior to this, we were fifty miles west from here.
A:	So we were right on the lake.
A:	And Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard
B:	Oh, what's that,
A:	And you do find people, uh, into the crafts and the things that, uh, various things for spare time,
A:	but, I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting
A:	and I'm just intrigued with it.
B:	If you ever start, be sure and start with a large piece that you can, I mean a large flat plate.
B:	Um, that way you can get the feel of,
B:	you're not cramped on these smaller objects.
A:	Right,
A:	where you're getting into the delicate work.
B:	That's right.
A:	Now, do you, where did you first get your lessons from?
B:	In Abilene, Texas.
A:	Through a, uh, an adult ed, or strictly a china type,
B:	She just taught china painting.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and,
A:	Oh, how marvelous.
B:	Then, then we had so much fun there,
B:	I had a friend from Albany, which is about thirty-six miles away,
B:	and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home, because she did our firing for us,
B:	and she would help us
B:	and we bought lots of equipment from her, supplies
B:	and it was just such a delightful time.
B:	And then after I,
A:	Oh, and it's so nice,
B:	Beg pardon?
A:	It must be so nice for you, now that you're retired.
B:	I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death.
B:	So I have put it aside for a little while,
B:	but I'm, I have just found me an instructor to get started again,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, isn't that great.
A:	And you'll probably really, uh, regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a, a class again.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course, I just have one beautiful with peonies, uh, umbrella stand,
B:	and I have two daughters
B:	and they're both,
A:	Uh, what what is your practice as far as budgeting?
A:	Do you manage the money?
B:	Well, I, we talk about it,
B:	but I'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and, and tries to somehow make the ends meet, which, uh,
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	That's how kind of I am, too.
A:	Are you married?
B:	Um, yes.
A:	You are.
B:	Yes.
A:	I think the women for the most part end up managing the money.
A:	My husband always says he earns it, and I have to spend only what he earns
A:	It,
B:	I don't mind the spending,
B:	it's just that trying to, trying to get what you need out of, out of what you have.
B:	That seems to be our challenge.
A:	Well, I don't work outside of the home,
A:	and he always threatens that when I spend more than, what's coming in, I have to go back to work
B:	I see.
A:	so I, I manage it
B:	Well, I'm, I'm at home also,
B:	so, it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary, uh,
A:	Now, do you actually follow a budget?
B:	Well, we pretty well do.
B:	Um, several years we didn't,
B:	and we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had,
B:	and so we, we, um, set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for, you know,
B:	just our bills.
B:	And then what's left we divvy up.
B:	We try to save a little bit, although we're not always successful,
B:	and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs.
A:	Well, that's pretty much the way we do, um, or we did in the past,
A:	I would say. Uh,
A:	at this point our children are grown,
A:	and so I really don't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to you know, get things together for them,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	and I really just keep very good records,
A:	and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that,
A:	and I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I don't always succeed at that.
A:	I usually keep one with a low interest rate,
A:	and I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to
B:	Right.
A:	and then I have another one,
A:	but for the most part, our mortgage and our utilities at this point, we're in a new home, and, uh, they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
B:	Yeah.
A:	so I'm still getting used to that,
A:	but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
B:	Right.
A:	and we do not buy us, new cars.
A:	Uh, do you get into car,
B:	Well, we had new cars, um, always until about four years ago,
B:	my husband, um, owned his own company and it went under,
B:	and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment,
B:	and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that, that we do have a used car,
B:	well, he has a company car also,
B:	but for our personal car we have a used car.
B:	Um, do you think that it's wiser to buy used?
A:	We do for us very much so.
A:	In fact, we are in a position that most of our friends why, wonder why we just don't go to a new car, you know, whatever,
A:	and I said look, you guys are all into car payments,
B:	Right.
A:	we haven't had car payments for so many years,
A:	I love it this way,
A:	and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked
A:	and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we were, kept saying, wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it.
A:	Believe it or not, we did, we found one, one newer
B:	Oh, no,
A:	the worst part is, it's the same color
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so everybody's saying, you're kidding, you have two cars the same,
A:	and I said, you know how when you have a bad one, you say, never again
B:	That's right
A:	I said, well, we had one, and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it
B:	Wow.
A:	and it's an eighty-five,
A:	and so I said, Hey, this was a cinch,
A:	we paid for the car,
A:	and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on.
B:	Right.
A:	This is for all the long running back and forth on, you know interstate driving and things,
A:	and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.
B:	Do you, um, buy from dealers or from individuals?
A:	Generally from dealers,
A:	and uh, it depends, because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual uh, unless we, we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	you know, we were going up to a larger one,
A:	but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer, and we always make a deal.
A:	I mean, we have walked out of more dealerships saying, don't bring us the manager, and all of that unless you want to bring him right away.
A:	You're going to get one shot at us
B:	Yeah.
A:	we will, you know,
A:	and they say, Well, you're kidding, you know.
A:	I
A:	no,
A:	this is the price we're going to give you out the door.
A:	We don't want to hear about taxes,
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess our topic is, um, advice about going to college.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have children of your own?
B:	Oh, no,
B:	I don't have any children,
B:	but I'm still going to college.
A:	Oh, are you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What school are you going to?
B:	N C State.
A:	Oh. Are you enjoying it?
B:	Um, well, it's a lot of work
A:	Are you working on your, um Bachelor's degree?
B:	My Bachelor's.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what field of study are you in?
B:	Um, it's actually in computer science
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have a special interest in Voice I O.
A:	Oh, well, that's neat.
A:	Are you from North Carolina?
B:	No,
B:	I'm actually from Amarillo, Texas, originally.
A:	Oh, are you really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh. Well, what took you to North Carolina?
B:	Oh, um, the service.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that was one of the things I was thinking about in school, um,
A:	I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock and, uh, I had a friend, my roommate went to Tech also,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she was from New Mexico
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she had to pay out of state tuition
B:	Ooh.
A:	and I think that would have, uh, played a real big part of my decision
B:	It would have played a major part in mine.
A:	yeah, because, um, she was
A:	of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now.
A:	It was like four dollars a semester hour
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I was going to school for, you know, just a few hundred dollars a semester,
A:	and she was paying forty dollars an hour
B:	Golly,
A:	so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state.
B:	Yeah,
B:	luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time.
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that, um, I liked well enough to attend.
B:	Uh-huh, um,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	The second thing is some colleges only offer the, uh, liberal arts and, uh, whereas like State, they offer engineering courses
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	so depending on what your major is, or medical, you might want to some, um, attend somewhere like Tech
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	and, um, aside from the, uh,
B:	well some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true,
A:	that was something else I had, was, I had government aid, of course,
A:	but, uh, it was wonderful, because I got one of those grants that you don't have to repay
B:	Oh, really.
A:	and, yeah,
A:	it was so nice
B:	Um.
A:	it paid most of my tuition, and, um, a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing
A:	so.
B:	Wow, that's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I really,
B:	Was it a Pell grant?
A:	I'm sorry, what did you say?
B:	What kind of grant was it?
A:	Well, it was called a B E O G, a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was from the government,
A:	and it was based, at first it was based on my parents' income.
A:	My parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, uh, because based on the number of children and the amount of money, uh, my father brought in, I got a small grant
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but then after that, I was on my own, working and, you know, trying to go to school on my own.
A:	So then I got a real big grant, because the amount of money I was making really didn't compare
B:	Wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it was kind of nice.
B:	Um.
A:	I don't know if those are still available or not,
A:	but,
B:	Uh, I'm not quite,
B:	there's, there's a lot of different organizations who, uh, who do give grants,
B:	but, uh, I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much, they, you know, they generally run.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	this was great,
A:	it was just based on, you know, how much your tuition costs and everything,
A:	and generally it paid everything,
A:	so I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that was,
B:	Golly, that's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was really nice.
B:	Oh, another thing.
B:	I've got a, I've got a degree from another college
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, something that might play a part is the size of the college.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, the smaller schools can give you a lot, uh, a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy,
B:	and and they just give you a teacher's assistants, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	instead of a scholar you get a T A
A:	That's right.
B:	and, uh, you don't get near the, uh, quality of education
B:	and as well, the, uh, smaller schools often times don't cost as much.
A:	Um, I didn't know that.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Um. Well, I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a, a Christian college, because I thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech
B:	Um.
A:	the Christian college was so much more expensive.
A:	But I guess some of the other smaller colleges might, might be a lot different.
B:	Um Oh, I, at State, I think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there
A:	Really?
B:	it's really a shame because of, you know, the instruction
A:	Yeah.
B:	um, I'd rather go to any other college, you know, in the state,
B:	and I would definitely get my money's worth, uh, much better than State.
A:	Yeah, huh.
B:	It's kind of unfortunate, because they've, they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	you're just a number.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're, they're bent on, uh, seeing how much land, how much more land they can get, and how much, uh, how much of the campus they can build up
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	it's really a bad situation here.
A:	Oh, that's a shame.
A:	Well, I, I felt a little cheated at Tech, also.
A:	Once I got into my,
A:	I, um, majored in,
A:	What, what do you feel is the, the major change that's been going on?
B:	That's a tough question.
B:	We are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework. Right
B:	Don't ask me.
A:	I think that has been the major change, is that, women feel they need to go out and do this,
A:	they, they no longer feel it's, uh, it's no big deal to, to stay home and raise your family any more.
B:	Well it has no credibility any more.
A:	I know it,
A:	and I, I think, I think that's really sad, because I think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else.
B:	Well, I'm a school teacher,
B:	and I'm in charge of raising them,
B:	so I can appreciate it.
A:	You don't, well
A:	I'm, I'm still home with, with my last one,
A:	and I wouldn't trade, change a minute of it for anything
B:	Oh, good for you,
B:	good for you.
A:	But, I, I can't, I can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again.
B:	Well, you know, it's interesting, because when I heard the topic, I was thinking, uh,
B:	this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that refused to go to work, and how their husbands thought they were terrible,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and one woman had four children,
B:	and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's,
B:	that's frightening
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it's sad,
B:	and, it, you know, it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	people were siding with the husband, saying, You've got to go to work, if you have these four children, you've got to support them,
B:	and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary
B:	That's true.
A:	uh, you know, to,
A:	I, I don't think, you know, the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars, and, and, and this type of thing.
A:	I think that they would from the, you know, attention or whatever
B:	That's true.
A:	uh, but, it,
A:	I, uh, I, I don't know,
A:	I, I see it as a major problem
A:	and I think it's going to have to swing back the other way, because I think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, you know, I, as I said, I teach school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, gosh, I'm trying to think,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I have one woman, one mother that I know is home,
B:	but she also has ten children.
A:	What, what grade do you teach?
B:	Six, seven and eight.
A:	Six, seven and eight.
A:	I've got a uh,
A:	where do you live?
A:	Are you out,
B:	In Richardson.
A:	In Richardson,
A:	we're in Plano here.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I have a daughter in middle school,
A:	and, uh, I know there aren't very many,
A:	she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home,
A:	but do you see, um, you know, do you ever, do you ever see problems, you know, that you feel you know, that the kids are left alone too much,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and,
B:	I've got one child, um, that stays with me every day until five, because his mother doesn't come home until seven,
B:	and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself.
A:	He stays at school?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the school allows that?
B:	Well, he stays with me
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have a tendency to work late.
B:	I work until six
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home
A:	Oh, my,
B:	and, you know, I have lots of kids, because they know I'm there late
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm a slow mover to say the least,
B:	but, um, they'll come in and say, Can I stay with you because I don't want to go home to an empty house.
B:	And that's frightening, because, you know, the,
B:	when I said I, I'm, I'm raising them, I am,
B:	because we're talking about boy friends
B:	and we're talking about what the girl said in class,
B:	and, you know, what's right because there's no mother at home
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No mother to talk to.
B:	and, um, it makes a difference,
B:	I,
B:	and just the social values,
A:	Well, I've just,
A:	do you, do you feel it will swing back the other way,
A:	or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to, uh you know, for, for more, more and more day care type situations?
B:	I, I don't know.
B:	I, I have a feeling we're going to go more and more,
B:	I've got a twenty-one year old female,
B:	and I've got twenty-two year old male child, children,
B:	and I listen to my daughter,
B:	and she's going to work,
B:	and she's going to buy her house,
B:	and she's going to get her car,
B:	and then she's going to have her children,
B:	and then when, you know, they go on one salary, will they be able to sustain what their life-style is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they're back to work,
B:	and, you know, I agree with you,
B:	I was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we lived without them,
B:	we did fine,
A:	Okay.
A:	I've got a, you know,
A:	I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing
A:	and then that's get half of the government, rid of the half of the government payroll.
B:	I think that would probably, uh, be very possible,
B:	and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services
A:	Not all,
A:	I, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to Washington D C.
B:	Yes,
B:	I have.
A:	Uh, you, you've seen that which was on there and the offices
A:	and in light of these, uh, hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.
B:	Right.
A:	They really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses at, in their own business of what they're doing.
B:	Right.
A:	And the other thing is, uh, besides that I think, uh, two things that very definitely need looking at, one is foreign aid.
A:	I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us.
B:	Right.
A:	I find that a total waste and part of the defense budget.
A:	Uh, again being just a voter and a taxpayer, you know, working through our congressman, I don't think there's too much that I'm going to be able to do about it,
A:	but I believe in taking an active part in politics,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I,
B:	one, one thing that really bothers me beyond, beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes
B:	and the, um, regular normal taxpayers are, you know paying such a large proportion of, of our personal income
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then the, uh, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally.
A:	Right.
B:	I think that that would, would help a lot.
B:	I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things,
B:	but I don't know. It's just hard to, hard to take and, you know, see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they don't, they don't seem to, well,
A:	I really think the biggest problem
A:	and then the Taft-Rudman Act is supposed to help that.
A:	The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean this nonsense that's coming through now about, uh, uh, lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money as it's, gets, it's ridiculous.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If they don't have that money now, bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government.
B:	Not, not going to help.
B:	It's never helped my, my personal situation
B:	I I can't say it would help with theirs either
A:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and thank God we don't operate our budget, the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in, in dire trouble.
B:	Amen .
A:	But that's, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I don't know what we're going to be able to do about it
A:	but I guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages.
A:	I don't ever expect to pay mine off before I die
A:	so I guess why should the government
A:	Isn't,
A:	that's the way they're thinking these days anyway.
B:	It seems, seems to be.
B:	I, you know, I,
B:	it really does bother me when I think about, you know, leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem to find an, an answer to it, uh,
B:	I don't know.
A:	I, I don't think it ever will really.
A:	I,
A:	maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.
B:	Right.
A:	Really.
A:	If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I believe in paying my share,
A:	and I don't mind, uh, paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to.
A:	But I just, I just sometimes feel like I'm being used.
A:	But, uh, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,
A:	so.
B:	Well, that's, that's quite possible.
B:	I guess we have to, have to keep plugging away a little bit
B:	or it will just totally get even more out of control
B:	but I, I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Bite the bullet.
A:	It sounds like you have a baby there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She's a,
B:	we're not feeling too well over here
B:	so that,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, that's a shame.
A:	She's not the one going to Washington, huh?
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	She's,
A:	Oh
B:	I don't think I could part with her.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay, Geri.
A:	We've probably been on long enough.
B:	Okay.
A:	They didn't cut us off,
A:	but I think that will probably do it
A:	so it was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, thanks.
A:	Okey-doke.
B:	Bye-bye
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	What's your favorite T V show?
A:	Oh. You know, I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's one of my old favorites.
A:	Um, and that's,
A:	I'm being beeped,
A:	so I'll just ignore it.
A:	Um, and now, I, I did like THIRTY SOMETHING
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	oh, yes,
A:	my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH.
A:	We like that one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's one of my favorites.
A:	Good,
A:	and how old are you?
B:	I'm twenty-eight.
A:	Oh, so you're little bit younger than I am,
A:	but yeah,
A:	I think if my seventeen year old, my fourteen year old, my other two children like it,
A:	I'm over forty,
A:	and I like it.
A:	I think it's wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a good show.
B:	I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN, too.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	now see, I, we are so busy with, all of our kids are in sports,
A:	and I hardly ever watch T V,
A:	but that's one that, that we watch.
A:	And then Sunday nights we watch, uh, LIFE GOES ON.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like that,
B:	that's, that's a good show, too.
A:	Very good.
A:	Did you see the one on Sunday?
B:	Yes,
B:	it was a, uh, uh
B:	I did miss that Sunday,
B:	no
B:	I didn't.
A:	That one kid that Becca likes he has AIDS.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a good episode.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the, the new character on there did.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	All the way to North Carolina.
A:	What time is it there?
B:	Uh, it is twenty minutes to nine.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	See, I'm twenty minutes to six here
B:	Three hours difference.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	What else do you like?
B:	Uh, let's see, I like a lot of different shows.
B:	Let's see, um, I like MURDER, SHE WROTE.
B:	That's, that's,
A:	Oh, I never, I never watched that ever in my entire life.
B:	And MATLOCK is another good one I watch.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, then during daytimes I like, I like ALL MY CHILDREN.
A:	A small bowl will be plenty.
A:	Oh, that's mine.
A:	That's the only one I watch whenever I, oh,
A:	a small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening.
A:	Talk to my daughter.
A:	Um, um,
B:	ALL MY CHILDREN,
B:	I've watched that for about twelve years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've, I'm sure I watched it for more than that probably.
A:	Twenty something.
A:	I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I,
B:	I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.
A:	Oh.
B:	So that was a long time ago.
B:	I used to watch it, was in high school and college when Laura's mother got killed.
A:	Right.
B:	She was my favorite character on there.
B:	I just,
B:	I read the reason she got, they, they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract,
B:	and I said, well, if they're going to do that to her, I won't watch it.
A:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Well, I do like ALL MY CHILDREN,
A:	and I, and I like it, you know, I don't know.
A:	I just,
A:	I like the people on it, I guess, you know.
B:	I, I, I like it.
B:	I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, Tad's going to come back, I bet, do you think?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm sure he will.
A:	He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.
B:	I kind of wish that, uh, Nina would come back because she because the story, you know,
A:	Oh.
B:	just for a brief visit or whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying, and everything,
A:	Yeah,
A:	like Daisy, pops in once in a while,
A:	and, I forgot about Nina and Cliff, right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now.
A:	Oh, he is.
A:	So he's out for good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's out for good.
A:	Did they marry?
B:	Uh
A:	Nina and Cliff?
B:	that's how they left the show, but not in real life.
A:	Um.
B:	Now she's married to some guy in New York,
B:	and she's happily married
B:	and that's the reason she left the show.
B:	I guess she wanted a private life.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	oh, see I, I, I watch it maybe twice a month,
A:	so, I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies.
B:	Oh, well, I, I watch.
A:	Because I play lots of tennis
A:	and I'm gone a lot,
A:	so, I don't get to watch,
B:	I watch it everyday, religiously.
B:	I videotape it when I have to miss it.
A:	Oh, no kidding.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I use to be, I used to be like that
B:	I'm that way about a lot of different shows.
B:	I'm that way about MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN.
A:	Now isn't DESIGNING WOMEN, don't they have a new chick on there instead of the, instead of what's her name?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	there's two new characters on there.
B:	There's, um, uh, Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE.
B:	I don't know if you know her or not.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	That's a show I like.
B:	And then, and then, uh, uh, the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART.
A:	Oh, yeah, oh.
B:	I don't like her on it,
B:	I never have liked her,
B:	so.
A:	Well, I, I just know which one she is.
A:	I don't, you know.
B:	She's taken the Suzanne's part,
B:	and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part.
A:	Charlene was Delta Burke?
B:	Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	well, see, I never watch that one either.
A:	I really don't watch a whole lot of T V, just, you know, on Sunday nights,
A:	LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner,
A:	and my whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night you know, because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so we, we sit around and eat popcorn
A:	and, oh, then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.
A:	Those are always pretty cute.
B:	Well, MURDER, SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that,
B:	and so,
A:	Oh, so you don't watch that one instead of,
B:	Yeah
B:	I I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different networks,
B:	but BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH, I, I watch it religiously.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we like that real well.
B:	It,
B:	be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody's getting killed on it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know.
A:	The kids already know who it is,
A:	I don't know who it is, though,
B:	Who is it?
B:	Ask them
A:	Let me ask Nicole.
A:	to someone in Nicole.
A:	What?
A:	Do you want to start?
B:	Uh, you hit, you hit, uh,
B:	it doesn't matter.
B:	Um, we're discussing the capital punishment, I believe.
A:	Right.
A:	You are right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I suppose I should have,
B:	Uh, which
B:	I am, am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	uh, I, uh, I guess, I, I hate to see anyone die, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I guess these people that go around and, and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to, to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.
B:	I, I agree.
B:	I, I'm,
B:	capital
B:	the, the,
B:	capital punishment is necessary in, in many cases
B:	but, uh, the,
B:	it's not a deterrent, um, or our jails would not be so full.
B:	There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it needs to be something, uh, uh, a throwback to where they did a, uh, public execution where it's visible.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, something, you know, not gruesome
B:	but, but something more where people know that it, it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people.
B:	If you committed a certain crime, you were going to receive a death penalty
B:	and it was going to happen to you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No stays of execution.
B:	No, no loopholes,
B:	no,
A:	Well, and even, even that I don't really know if that would help.
A:	I think a lot of these people do it, uh, mainly because of, of T V
A:	and,
B:	Notoriety.
A:	the double reason they, they see it being done on T V and also the fact of, of notoriety.
A:	I mean, they become well known.
A:	They are almost like, like a big star.
B:	yes,
B:	but, but they, they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That they are going to write a book.
B:	They are going to go on talk shows
B:	they're
B:	that, that, that's a reward uh, for a heinous crime rather than, uh, having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	In, in complete, uh,
B:	of any notoriety.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I, I, I think if they went according to, uh, the BIBLE where it does say, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	uh, you take a life you give yours.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, uh, that's for sure.
A:	Uh, there's exceptions to the rule
A:	I mean if, if it's an accidental taking then, uh, you look at that
A:	but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and, and do it out of pure pleasure uh, I don't, uh, like to see that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent,
A:	it is a deterrent in the, in the sense that that person will never do it again
B:	Well, yes,
B:	they will.
A:	Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.
B:	It,
B:	Oh, ,
B:	well, that's correct,
B:	yes.
B:	if, if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is, it is executed.
A:	The death penalty.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, but the, the, the chances are not great that that will happen.
A:	Right.
B:	But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.
A:	I, I, I guess I been thinking about it
A:	and I don't have a definite opinion
A:	but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	Just for pleasure too
A:	and I guess you've got to look at something like that.
B:	Yes.
A:	Do they deserve to, uh, remain on this earth too?
B:	Why, you know, you could carry it to that if, uh, if they are a repeat offender
B:	and, and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.
B:	Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, um, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,
A:	Right.
B:	and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.
B:	You, you wouldn't be able to under our system.
A:	Right.
B:	Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that.
B:	Um, you get caught with dope there and you die, period.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There is, there is no, no appeals.
B:	There is no,
A:	Well, I don't know what to do about the federal budget.
A:	Um, there certainly have been ideas surfaced, uh, recently, uh, matter of fact repeatedly by many people
A:	and I sort of wondered what your, what thoughts you had on that area.
B:	The, the first one is we need people in there that, that understand, uh, numbers. The numbers that are being thrown around when, when we're talking in trillions of dollars. Uh, which is an astronomical sum
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means.
A:	Now are you, are you talking about the elected people
A:	or are you talking about others?
B:	The elected people.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Our, our, our Senate and Congress and, and people that, that deal everyday and, and what's going to be done with those monies um, and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works.
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we need to elect people that are more, uh,
B:	or ...
A:	I'm not sure how you would
A:	how would you achieve that?
A:	I mean if,
B:	Well, let's, let's make them have a degree in economy, uh, or economics.
A:	So you would trust the decision making economists?
B:	Well
A:	Sometimes called the dismal science.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, but people that, that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	um, and
B:	in, in, in
B:	the, the, uh, lobbyists,  needs them to be eliminated, uh,  from Congress. Um,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	They don't make pragmatic decisions.
B:	They make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe.
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, you know, or they tack on this, uh, pork bellies and, and do things that, that are good for their area to pass something that is, that is not good for the country.
A:	Right.
A:	So, so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists.
A:	I mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say, make them all .
B:	Oh, I, I definitely would.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Get rid of them.
B:	Totally. Uh,
A:	No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for?
B:	I, I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that, and be registered with what they ever contribute.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That, that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned.
A:	Yeah.
B:	When you are talking again, uh, billions and trillions of dollars uh, you're, you're jeopardizing the future of the country, uh, for today.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That,
A:	So, uh, you talk about jeopardizing the future.
A:	Would you be against any deficit spending?
B:	I, I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line.
B:	You can't ease into it.
B:	It took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I, I forget the figures on the interest rate
B:	but it's something like, uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves.
B:	We, we buy from intimate international banking.
B:	That's why we have interest.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and I, I, I really feel that, that, that is part of the problem that we, we've let things get so out of control that, that we don't want to put the brakes on them.
A:	But what practical steps could could one take? Um,
B:	By, by having a, a, a budget that is, is feasible, that is reasonable.
A:	Well, but everybody will say that he is for that. Uh,
A:	and,   and how will you,  make that actually happen?
B:	Oh, of course.
B:	Sure .
B:	And then add on to it.
B:	You take the gross national income and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	One thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax. Across-the-board,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	everyone no matter what,  pays a ten percent income tax.
A:	Yep.
A:	Sounds like a good idea.
B:	Uh,
A:	Nothing escapes, right?
A:	No, no,  deductions, nothing.
B:	That's right.
B:	Right.
B:	No deductions.
A:	Just ten percent.
B:	You pay a ten percent income tax.
A:	Yep.
B:	That's what you pay
B:	if you make forty million dollars, uh, then you're going to pay four million.
A:	Right.
B:	if you make forty dollars, you're going to pay four dollars.
B:	And, and that's it.
A:	Yep.
A:	So that, that's it.
A:	That's I mean
A:	I, I agree with that
A:	that's a good idea
A:	and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or, or lower them or what?
B:	I don't know that it would or wouldn't.
A:	Well, what's your favorite baseball team, Rita?
B:	Well, I suppose I'm supposed to say the Rangers, right
B:	Is that what
B:	is the million dollar question here?
A:	Well, that isn't a, a true false or right or wrong test here.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, uh, you know, I would like to say the Rangers,
B:	but unfortunately they're not.
B:	I was from Illinois,
B:	and my favorite team was the White Sox.
A:	Not a Cubbies fan, huh.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	my family, my dad was,
B:	but I turned out to be a White Sox fan.
A:	Well, that's all right.
B:	I lived in Chicago.
A:	How do you expect them to do this year?
B:	Yeah
B:	they did pretty well.
A:	Okay.
B:	What did you think of the World Series?
A:	Well, I'll tell you.
A:	I just, uh, moved down from South Dakota in July,
A:	and, uh, in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so everybody was a Twins fan,
A:	and I was kind of, uh, didn't have much interest in the Twins, you know,
A:	it was, it was kind of pathetic, I mean,
A:	we only had two radio stations,
A:	and one of them broadcast every Twins game live, you know,
A:	and, and the other one was country.
B:	So you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you.
A:	So, that's right.
A:	There's was Twins there, or, you know Skip Williams.
B:	Or country.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, uh, and I was routing for the Twins myself because, uh, they, a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here, uh, went to Minnesota,
B:	and we used to tease about, my son
B:	and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota,
B:	but it was it certainly was an exciting Series, anyway.
A:	It sure was,
A:	it sure was.
B:	What do you think going to happen to the Rangers?
A:	Well, I I would like to assume that they're going to do, do better this coming year,
B:	Or can we predict?
A:	I was sure hopeful anyway.
A:	When we moved down, uh, I was able to go to my first, you know baseball game, and thought, this is great, this is incredible.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I became a Rangers fan.
A:	I didn't really have one in South Dakota.
A:	So I adopted the Rangers,
A:	or rather they adopted me, I guess
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it was just exciting, you know,
A:	you can watch baseball on T V
A:	and they hit the long ball,
A:	and it looks like wow, they really hit that ball.
A:	But when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far you know,
B:	No.
A:	and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you,
A:	and.
B:	Oh, isn't it though.
B:	You know, but, oh, I, I think going to the ball park just really makes it. Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you're more a part of it too.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
B:	Well, I'm a great sports enthusiast,
B:	so I love, you know, baseball teams,
B:	and they,
B:	in fact, on the news tonight, Nolan Ryan was on there.
B:	He was being, he was put in the, which I never knew existed, the Restaurant Hall of Fame
A:	The Restaurant
B:	The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight,
B:	and he, uh, says he's coming back, you know, uh,
A:	Huh.
B:	he doesn't know how many years I mean, to pitch.
A:	Right.
B:	He'll be at least one more,
B:	and he said he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.
B:	He likes it.
A:	That's right
B:	Yeah.
A:	and he's still doing great still doing excellent.
B:	That's right.
B:	You know, and he said, I get a kick out of it, you know,
B:	he's, he's such a nice man.
A:	Well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and he,
B:	you know when he quits at being active, he will go into, you know being a, managing and, yeah, you know, being a coach, I'm sure.
A:	Management.
A:	Right.
B:	But, he's, uh, he certainly is a good example, uh, for the kids.
A:	That's right.
B:	You know, you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see what a fine man, that, he is.
A:	You know, some of the,
A:	like, uh, Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when, when, uh, Nolan Ryan started pitching.
B:	That's right.
A:	And it's just incredible to think that there's, uh, there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and now their sons are.
B:	Oh, he's been a legend for so many years, you know,
B:	and I don't know,
B:	were you here, had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son.
B:	His son pitched for U T
B:	and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I wasn't.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was a,
B:	I think it was a little early part of the summer,
B:	and uh, Nolan against.
A:	Was it Nolan against, uh
A:	Ryan against Ryan, huh.
B:	Ryan against Ryan,
B:	yeah,
B:	his son pitched for U T
A:	Well that is neat.
B:	and, uh, only, uh, Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	A game is a game, you know.
B:	Well, the Rangers really, uh, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect you know, anyway,
A:	Right.
B:	but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something, you know, of the game
B:	so,
A:	Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?
B:	Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.
A:	Oh, you did?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was on the jury. Uh,
A:	Wow.
B:	Yeah
B:	Which is funny because I got called last night
B:	and the topic was, uh, something about juries
A:	Oh, really
B:	Yeah,
B:	so I am just hitting it right.
B:	Uh, how do I feel about it?
B:	I, I don't know.
B:	Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	well, the one I was just on, I don't,
B:	I was an alternate on the case,
B:	so I don't know what was decided.
A:	Right.
B:	They are probably still in deliberations on it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, what I found out,
B:	once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy
B:	and I remember hearing about it.
B:	It was about a year ago.
B:	Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month
B:	and he was caught just,
B:	they, they drove up,
B:	the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	So he was caught
B:	and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in,
B:	I'm not in Dallas county,
B:	I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had two capital murders.
A:	Wow.
B:	And last year there were six
B:	and this guy is indicted on three of them.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	so you have to wonder you know.
A:	Wow
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, the cases like that, they should,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.
B:	Yeah,
B:	although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.
B:	You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.
A:	Really?
B:	He just, well,
B:	from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,
B:	but I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own.
A:	Right.
A:	Wow.
B:	So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again I mean, you've got to do something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours.
A:	Right.
A:	Wow.
B:	And I,
B:	the,
B:	I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.
A:	You're kidding.
B:	But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone
B:	and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt
B:	and I said I can't imagine,
B:	I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,
B:	I guess I could convict him,
B:	but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.
A:	Right.
B:	But they really did.
B:	It was, it was really amazing.
A:	Really?
A:	Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,
B:	Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released
A:	Okay.
B:	so no one else would have known.
A:	Oh.
B:	It was, it was really pretty interesting.
A:	Wow.
A:	What,
B:	Educational.
A:	I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.
B:	Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.
A:	Okay.
A:	Of that crime
B:	Right.
A:	but he was found guilty of
A:	okay.
B:	Right,
B:	so you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much to prove that.
A:	That works.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Well, they pushing the death penalty?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	this guy is up for the death penalty.
A:	Wow.
B:	Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.
B:	Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation
B:	And there is a number of questions
B:	and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment
B:	and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.
A:	Okay.
A:	So,
B:	So there is a lot of outs,
B:	but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much.
B:	Yeah
B:	Right,
B:	and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.
A:	That's true.
A:	I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but,
B:	But then you have to look at reality.
B:	I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out
B:	so,
A:	That's true.
B:	But what is it worth?
B:	I don't know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.
A:	That's true.
A:	I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, you said you're from Mississippi?
A:	Yes, ma'am.
B:	And do they have the death penalty there?
A:	Yes,
A:	they do.
A:	I,
A:	they've had a, a number of cases here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, not a whole lot,
A:	well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was like last like year they had forty-nine
A:	so that's going up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	they have a death penalty.
A:	I hear of one every now and then.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I visited the prison up here and, at Parchman
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I've been,
A:	I haven't,
A:	they won't let you on death row,
A:	but they'll let you look down the hall.
A:	You can't see any prisoners
A:	and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.
A:	I've been
A:	they took us around on a tour, you know,
A:	and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber
B:	Ooh.
A:	and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.
B:	That's right.
A:	But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,
A:	Well, uh, let's see,
A:	what type of car do I want?
A:	Well, I'd like to have a Corvette.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	But my, uh, weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car,
A:	so
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, I'm engaged to get married
A:	so, I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, so, uh, to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much.
A:	And we have a truck,
A:	so probably a economic size car or, uh,
B:	What kind of a car do you have now?
A:	Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier.
A:	It's a piece of
B:	My car is really old, too,
B:	because, uh, I drive out of town a lot of the weekends
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, same here, uh,
B:	you know, a nice car, American made
B:	and, uh, you know, a, a nice car, but not too expensive,
B:	because, uh, I couldn't afford like a brand new like Lamborghini
B:	I hardly drive,
A:	But while we're talking,
A:	right
B:	While we're talking, my next car, I'd like to be sporty and, you know nice,
A:	Right.
B:	but, you know, it's expensive
B:	and then insurance is really high for that, too
B:	so, Something with a, that's not too sporty because of insurance, then
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	Right,
A:	that insurance does come into play.
A:	I forgot about that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What kind of insurance do you have up there
A:	or is it real high up there?
B:	Uh, no
B:	mine just got lowered because I just turned twenty-one
B:	and, uh, I'm not sure really how much I pay.
B:	I just,
B:	my mom's helping me out, you know, because I'm a college, I'm in college
B:	and, uh, so I just give her the money and take her word for it
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	I mean that insurance is high dollars.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it is,
B:	so,
A:	But,
B:	And the more expensive the car, the higher it is
B:	so, Unless I win the lottery, I won't be driving, anything too expensive.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't plan on buying a car for many, many years
B:	so,
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	I have to make this one last as long as I can.
A:	What's everybody drive up there?
B:	Uh, in Kenosha?
A:	I mean in Wisconsin, they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive
B:	Oh, it just is,
A:	or, do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because, uh, because of the snow, you mean
B:	or,
A:	Right,
A:	it never snows down here,
A:	so,
B:	Well, we don't have any snow here now.
A:	Really?
B:	It all melted.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there is no snow at all.
A:	We haven't had snow yet.
A:	We usually only get like once a year or so.
B:	Huh.
A:	Kind of strange to you all, huh?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	Because, how,
A:	it's like seventy degrees here right now.
B:	Oh, don't tell me that
A:	Yep,
A:	how, how cold is it there?
B:	Well, actually, it's been warm,
B:	it's in the forties.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and that's, that's really warm.
A:	Huh.
B:	Uh, and it's supposed to rain tomorrow
B:	so we,
B:	I've only seen snow once this year.
B:	And it was really bad
B:	and then it all melted like within the week.
A:	Really?
B:	And now there is no snow,
B:	so,
A:	Huh.
A:	But, um, so what, what is your dream car?
B:	Uh, I haven't really thought about it.
B:	I'm not too big on cars.
B:	I mean, I don't know the names and stuff,
B:	but if I were to go to a car lot and like look at them I would pick out one that, you know looked really nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What's your favorite color?
B:	Uh, for a car?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Probably blue. Like if it, you know, was just an average, middle class car.
A:	Blue?
B:	But if I were to get a sports car, maybe white or red
A:	Right
A:	right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, what kind of car do you drive right now?
B:	Uh, it's a Sky Hawk Buick.
A:	Really?
B:	Eighty-three,
B:	I think.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, like eighty-two thousand miles.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'm afraid it's not going to last me that long
B:	and I hope it does, though.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's a two door.
B:	I like, I like smaller cars.
B:	They're,
B:	I find them more comfortable to drive.
A:	Right,
A:	does everybody have their windows tinted up there?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I don't see too many cars tinted.
A:	Everybody has tinted down here.
B:	Oh, I'm sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	I could, I could see why.
A:	So, you been down here before?
B:	Yep.
A:	Really?
B:	Uh,
A:	Did you like it?
B:	It was busy
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's different I bet, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	It was nice.
B:	I remember, uh, swimming on Easter day
B:	and it was like really cold up here,
B:	but came back with a little tan,
A:	Right
B:	so that was nice
A:	It's like, you know,
A:	everybody freaks out when it
B:	Hi,
B:	well, I guess,
B:	which one have you got right now?
B:	Or,
A:	Well, I, uh,
A:	couple of them,
A:	I, at the moment, use an A S T two eighty-six
A:	and I got a leading edge
A:	and I got a American one and had a I B M one,
A:	but
B:	My, my,
B:	just a couple.
A:	What do you have
B:	Uh, I've got an Omega
B:	and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four eighty-six machine.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's very, very generic.
A:	What did you do, put it together?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled
B:	and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
A:	Well, that's,
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's all I got to say for it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What do you use it for?
B:	Huh?
A:	What do you use it for?
B:	Uh, work,
B:	uh, I'm a contract programmer.
A:	Oh, yeah?
A:	What kind of programs do you,
B:	Uh, anything
A:	Okay,
A:	I mean like business programs
A:	or, Man.
B:	Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment
B:	and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens.
B:	It was kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
A:	Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	That's where the speed helps out.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six.
B:	It's like slow out the
A:	Yep,
A:	that will, that will, slow you up
B:	Huh?
A:	Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, really need a faster system.
A:	Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.
A:	Who is that?
B:	Uh, his name is T Q or something like that.
B:	And my notebook is somewhere around here
B:	See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.
A:	I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
B:	Uh, he's, uh, up in,
B:	Huh?
A:	That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them.
A:	They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
B:	Oh, that works.
A:	that's why I have so many different levels of P C around at the moment.
B:	Uh, here it is.
B:	A T S Computers.
A:	A T S?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And where are they at?
B:	Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Okay,
B:	he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer.
B:	And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.
A:	In Richardson there.
B:	Huh?
A:	In Richardson?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know where you mean.
A:	There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner,
A:	that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
B:	Right,
B:	it's, it's, it's just south of there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's a little place, looks like a castle.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of, uh, little guy in there.
B:	He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
A:	Oh.
B:	Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
A:	Really?
A:	Well, that's a good deal.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was pretty reasonable.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, uh, he,
B:	and he does a good job
B:	and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.
A:	Uh, there is a lot,
A:	you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	I used to,
A:	when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.
A:	So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days.
A:	But I, ,
B:	Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
A:	I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh, yeah,
B:	I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,
B:	you know, it's like, wow
A:	Yeah.
B:	That works,
B:	I'll go do that
A:	I,
B:	And boy that thing screams now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six.
A:	That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
A:	Is that right?
A:	That's it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Huh, well,
A:	you've done.
B:	Our most recent series of projects I guess, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.
A:	Well, how did it go?
B:	Well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,
B:	and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain.  Which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over.
A:	Gee, like starting over, I guess.
A:	Uh.
B:	It wasn't one of those,
B:	it started out as a Sunday project
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and by, by the next Sunday it was done.
B:	It wasn't a one dayer.
B:	Believe me.
A:	Boy, that sounds like, uh,
A:	course, uh, I don't know,
A:	once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's good for another thirty years.
A:	Um, you've got an older house?
B:	Yes.
A:	They are built a little bit more sturdy than
B:	Well, that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper,
A:	Right.
B:	and it was all soldered.
A:	Oh, is that right.
B:	That's what drove me bananas, because, you know, I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together
A:	Yes.
B:	and nothing wanted to go,
B:	so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over.
A:	And just start at square one.
B:	Really.
A:	Uh.
B:	That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed.
A:	Well, and then if you do it wrong
B:	Fortunately, I was very fortunate, uh, in the fact that, uh, when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on  nothing leaked,
A:	Everything went all right.
B:	everything worked.
B:	And I just said, that's marvelous.
B:	I appreciate it.
A:	That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.
B:	Well, I expected something to leak, you know left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
B:	But it all came together,
B:	so I, I felt pretty fortunate about that.
A:	All worked out all right, huh.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, um, well probably the last thing I did was, uh, paint and wallpaper kids room
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I learned to,
A:	I used the wrong kind of paint.
A:	This wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.
B:	What kind of paint?
A:	It was a latex paint, paint,
A:	it was flat
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss.
A:	Uh, but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens, and things like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, and semigloss for trim work, and usually flat for walls.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I think maybe, uh,
A:	I don't know if it was just the.
B:	Was it not washable paint?
A:	Well, it, it is a latex paint,
A:	but it just kind of is, is,
A:	so, you know, so it's supposed to wash, you're supposed to be able to wash it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it, um, just looks dingy.
A:	I don't know how else to explain it.
B:	What color is it?
A:	It's pink.
B:	Pink,
B:	okay.
A:	It's kind of got, uh, oh, just kind of a worn look to it.
A:	I don't know even how to say,
A:	just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked
A:	but,
B:	Did you, uh, require more than one can of paint?
A:	I, we put two coats on it,
A:	and it's a small room,
A:	but I think it only took one, uh, can.
B:	You didn't have to mix paint then, right.
A:	No.
B:	Okay.
A:	We did, uh, oh,
A:	you do mix the color as far as you start with, uh, white
A:	and then they add the color.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know what I'm saying
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
A:	And then I wall papered a couple of walls,
A:	and, uh.
B:	How'd that go?
A:	Well, that was the first time I've ever wallpapered,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Kind of fun, isn't it.
A:	That's an education in itself.
B:	Really.
A:	But, uh, the dye lots, uh, must have been a little bit different from,
A:	first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying to match a design.
B:	Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you, when you buy your paper.
A:	Yes.
A:	That's what I needed,
A:	and I didn't think about that.
A:	I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so a lot is wasted.
B:	Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.
A:	So you know how.
A:	See, I didn't even think to look for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then the,
A:	one of them was just a different color, different color pink, is what it ended up being.
B:	Um.
A:	And .
B:	When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?
A:	No
A:	I didn't.
B:	Or did you start at the edge?
A:	Is that how you're supposed to do?
A:	I started at one edge and went over,
A:	then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh,
B:	I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall,
B:	and I'll start with a plumb line. And start in the middle of the wall, and, and go from there, and go all the way around the room.
A:	And start right there.
A:	Do you seem to get it straighter,
A:	is that the advantage,
A:	or what's the,
B:	Well, you, you,
A:	Do you have any children?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen.
A:	Twelve and sixteen.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	how about you?
A:	Well, I have three,
A:	and, uh, they're five and three and nineteen months.
B:	Oh.
A:	So we kind of got different ball game
A:	but, uh.
B:	Right
A:	What, uh,
A:	do you feel like you have any time, to spend with them?
B:	Well.
A:	They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.
B:	That's true
B:	You actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older,
B:	but it's, of course, still really important.
A:	Right.
B:	I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old.
B:	Um, I work two nights a week at a,
B:	I'm a librarian
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.
B:	They keep it open, you know, for kids to do their work
A:	Right.
B:	and he, um, and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know, to work for me.
A:	Sure.
B:	Well, my son is my aide.
A:	Oh, well, that's nice.
B:	So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together
A:	You're stuck together.
B:	and there's usually not very much business.
A:	No.
B:	I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.
B:	So.
A:	I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.
B:	So we, I have sort of a captive audience,
B:	so I really do spend probably more time with him than, than most, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.
B:	But his dad's at home pretty much that time.
A:	And so that kind of gives him, uh, time with his dad, then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	yeah.
A:	Gives him a little bit of that individual time.
B:	But, but it is hard, once they get that age,
B:	I mean, their friends are the most important thing there is.
A:	Right,
A:	and they want to be able to spend, uh.
B:	That's right.
A:	Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year,
A:	and every day that she's not at school, uh, she thinks we need to have someone over and play
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and that kind of
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's kind of hard.
A:	yeah,
A:	it's hard,
A:	I think, uh, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm more worried about, Oh,
A:	I didn't this done,
A:	I didn't get,
A:	the kitchen needs to be cleaned
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	this needs to be done,
A:	and and I need to remind myself to slow down
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it'll still be there tomorrow.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	But that's kind of hard to do, you know.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is hard to do,
B:	right,
B:	yeah.
A:	You don't see yourself getting.
B:	Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or neat
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or, you know
A:	Right.
B:	then I think it, it is hard.
B:	It's, um,
B:	I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah, with family.
A:	Slow down a little bit.
B:	We have, we often go to Illinois for Christmas,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and we're not this year,
B:	and it's just really nice because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.
A:	You can do, uh, more than than when you travel.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	This is the first year we're staying home, too,
A:	and, uh, I think it's going to be real quiet
A:	but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	See, we usually do that,
B:	my, my kids even have already gotten out, um,
B:	my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer
A:	Right.
A:	Of of course.
B:	but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,
B:	you know, and he wants to be an engineer,
B:	so he still likes all that kind of building stuff
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, um, we have the train,
B:	and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,
B:	and, um, so he sat down,
B:	and I told him I really wanted him to build the train,
B:	and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,
B:	I wouldn't take it apart
A:	Wouldn't take it apart after that.
B:	yeah,
B:	and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.
A:	That'd be kind of fun.
B:	And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,
B:	and, um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, you know.
B:	you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	those kinds of things never happen
A:	No
B:	but.
A:	no.
A:	In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V
A:	and
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family,
B:	Yes,
B:	yeah.
B:	Which is,
A:	usually people are not sitting in front of that.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.
B:	The rest of.
A:	Yes,
A:	and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
B:	No
B:	That's right.
A:	Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well,
A:	I shouldn't say I could not,
A:	but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	me too.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Because they talk so much,
A:	isn't that the,
B:	they talk about T V shows,
B:	and I, huh,
B:	you know, how can you watch that, you know
A:	You're kind of like, what are you talking about
A:	and, uh,
B:	it's the best show on,
B:	I don't know.
A:	You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.
A:	They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,
B:	Okay,
B:	all set, then.
B:	Uh, what do you think about it?
A:	Uh, I think it's a real good concept.
A:	Uh, drug testing procedures would have to be refined.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	From what I've seen on the news there's a, a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, uh, drug testing.
B:	Oh, I didn't realize that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test,
A:	but they didn't know for sure what it was,
A:	but it was a drug,
A:	so they got turned down
A:	and, uh, turns out it was a prescription. Or people getting somebody else's blood test.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like AIDS tests and such.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's right,
B:	I have heard,
B:	uh, I don't remember what they call it, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they use when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs,
B:	but there's not really, there weren't really any there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, every now and then there's an error
B:	and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I work here at Texas Instruments
B:	so, uh, we, we do a, let me think, do we, yeah, everyone coming in.
B:	I guess I did three years ago.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Everyone coming in, uh, goes through the drug testing procedure
B:	and they talk about it as a, you know, as, as better for the country and better for the working conditions.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So if they, uh, they test for drugs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I'm, I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore.
B:	I know we did in the military,
B:	but I don't know if once your in they continue to do it,
A:	Yeah
B:	but I guess you're always on call for it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and about a year and a half ago they instituted a, uh, a, uh, drug testing program, uh, well drug and alcohol testing program.
A:	It's, it's not a random
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	through the
A:	it,
A:	as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a, a blood test Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I think the big problem, though, is, is they send these off to large labs
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, uh, going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up, things like that.
B:	So your big beef with it is the, uh,
A:	It's .
B:	Is, is, it's a good idea,
B:	but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I, I tend to agree with you David.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my brother, uh, brother used to work for Wal-Mart
B:	and then, I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if Sam's is actually part of it,
B:	but he, you know is working at Sam's now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Sam's is part of Wal-Mart.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah,
B:	then he's been working for the company for a while, too.
B:	He, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Good company, uh,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You all, uh, have some,
B:	he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that,
A:	Company's, that was a great place to work.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's good news
A:	Yeah,
A:	they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock
A:	and you have a, have a little taken out of your check each, each payday to put against, uh, uh, stock portfolio. Uh, not portfolio, just, you know, against Wal-Mart stock.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what my brother was telling me.
B:	That's good, good good deal.
B:	Well, uh, how long were we
B:	I haven't done this in a couple months.
B:	How long were we supposed to discuss for?
A:	Uh, you're supposed to get five minutes.
B:	Okay,
B:	we got a couple more minutes then, I guess
B:	Uh, think what else I can say about that. Uh,
A:	Uh, do you have any idea, uh,
A:	let's see,
A:	you were, you were tested for drugs as you got into T, as, as you got into T I?
B:	Right,
B:	uh, everyone coming in gets, goes through the drug test.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, now, uh, were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
A:	or,
B:	Uh, no,
B:	well, let me think about that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was after, I I had already been hired. Uh,
A:	Okay
B:	Yeah,
B:	you get hired, then you come in the first,
B:	I,
B:	seems to me I remember that, uh, I was hired, came in and went through some orientation
B:	and I thought I,
B:	boy, I can't remember.
B:	That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test.
B:	Maybe it was during the interview.
B:	I came up a couple times for an interview,
B:	so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened.
B:	But, uh, I guess, just like other companies, other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around,
B:	it's, it's before.
B:	They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment,
B:	so I'm sure that happened to me, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What, what about, oh,
B:	they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,
A:	They, they, it was after I was already working there
A:	and they weren't testing any of those who were already working.
B:	Right.
A:	So,
A:	Okay,
A:	now then you heard the question,
A:	what  what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than I do now.
A:	Okay.
B:	I do, uh, I do the easy stuff now.
B:	I change oil,
B:	uh, and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, I, I'll change spark plugs
B:	and I'll change, you know, points and, you, you know, do air filters, that kind of stuff.
A:	Um.
A:	Well.
B:	But, uh, I can't do as much as I used to,
B:	um, I used to do a whole lot more, but not any more,
B:	they're just too weird to work on now.
A:	Is that the reason you're not doing it,
A:	or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?
B:	Well, that's part of it
A:	Uh.
B:	yeah,
B:	part of it is, like you said, I don't have time.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well being a female and being alone, you, I don't do anything but put gasoline, in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?
B:	Well, um, on this car I've got now, no,
B:	but I had a van before,
B:	and it was only two years old,
B:	and it had transmission go out on it.
A:	Oh.
B:	But fortunately that was covered under the warranty.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, you should be, feel very fortunate.
A:	I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile
B:	Um.
A:	and I'll declare, that's an expensive.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Maybe I should have just traded the car in.
B:	Yeah,
B:	sometimes it makes you wonder.
A:	Oh, it just,
A:	well, I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, um, anyway, I have a new transmission,
A:	and I'm sure that any of them would have cost or charged me almost the same amount.
A:	But
B:	Yeah.
A:	it hurts, it hurts real bad.
B:	Did you take it to a dealership?
A:	No,
A:	I took it to an independent out in Garland.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	I had, um,
A:	these people were recommended by a neighbor
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, that's the only thing,
A:	I am not a native of Dallas.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So that means I have to depend on, on trustworthy friends
B:	Right.
A:	and that's.
A:	Anyway, it's fixed,
A:	it's running,
A:	and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's going to run for a for a while yet.
A:	Oh, I know it.
A:	It certainly is frightening.
A:	What work are you in?
B:	Uh, I, I work for T I.
A:	Oh.
B:	I, I work in the networking area.
A:	Okay,
A:	okay.
B:	Do you work for T I?
A:	No.
B:	No,
B:	okay.
A:	No,
A:	I have just retired from, um, the Southwest Medical Center.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car,
A:	but they're all too busy.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have to do it the other way,
A:	and that's find someone and pay them to do it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I'm, I'm planning on it.
B:	Oh, it can't be any worse than last year,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Oh, it could be,
A:	but I don't much think so
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	I'm, well, we're starting out a new one,
A:	so let's make it a good one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm going to try and plan on it.
A:	Okay.
B:	All right, well, I enjoyed the conversation.
A:	Thank you.
B:	All right, thank you.
A:	Bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	what, um,
B:	do you watch much T V
B:	or, you know.
A:	Um, no,
A:	I don't watch much T V.
A:	Sometimes, um, usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news.
B:	The news,
B:	yeah.
A:	But I don't think of that every day, even.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I think I get most of my current events,
A:	well, I get them from everywhere.
A:	I sometimes watch T V if I,
A:	I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day.
A:	We don't get a paper
A:	but I work, um, at a,
A:	I teach a college class
A:	and, uh
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	there's a,
A:	the library has a paper.
A:	And so I often drop in on a break and and read it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I, I figure if there's big, big news, I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or, someone else, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Now I also,
B:	I get it from all over.
B:	I watch the news every day,
B:	and I we have a news,
B:	you know, we get the newspaper, and, uh um, magazines, anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I'm,
B:	I read a lot,
B:	so I get,
B:	um, you know, I'm, I'm really up on, uh, current affairs.
B:	I get, you know the news and, and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what's your favorite news,
A:	do you get a news magazine
A:	or,
B:	Um, well, I'm not getting
B:	no,
B:	I'm not getting any news magazines
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, you know, as, as I said, I do,
B:	it's, uh, it's easy to keep up on current you know on you know, especially when you, um you know, you get a paper every day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've got.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	And, uh.
A:	Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?
B:	Uh, I don't know
B:	Is there anything missing?
B:	I, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's kind of hard to know.
B:	And I don't know, you know, what, what's, I mean, what are we supposed to, uh, compare it to you know, I mean, the quality, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	whatever they tell you,
B:	you know, I, uh, I guess I, I, you know, I'm satisfied.
B:	I mean, I,
B:	uh, you know, they, they're supposedly covering everything that happens,
B:	so
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	you know.
A:	Well, I do feel like, a little bit like,
A:	being from California and wanting to hear like
A:	I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,
A:	and
B:	Oh, really?
A:	I don't ever hear it in the news here.
B:	Oh.
A:	Um.
B:	Well, uh, sometimes it's such a,
B:	you know, it's, it's so, um, slight, you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But most of the the times I find that even if there are, you know, they do have like tremors out there, you know, there'll be a small article in the paper about it.
A:	Yeah
B:	But, uh.
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I sometimes feel like, um, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS, um, the top headlines are always a murder, you know.
B:	Oh, well.  That's what sells papers.
A:	That  that's because there's a high crime rate.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's, um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm sure.
B:	You know, but, um, I don't know.
B:	I, I guess I'm satisfied,
B:	I don't, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	really.
B:	We don't get a, you know.
A:	That's true.
A:	We certainly get enough coverage.
A:	I mean, we, we can get news,
A:	you know, I mean, there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I was going to.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad
A:	Yeah
B:	It's all so negative, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	often times.
B:	But.
A:	So. Yeah.
B:	Well, we have to keep talking, I guess
A:	Well, no,
A:	I guess we can end.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's just whenever we're, um.
B:	Oh, is it really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you always gone until the recording?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I don't, I don't, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess we're not supposed to
B:	I don't know,
B:	we're I guess we're supposed to wait
B:	or I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I,
B:	you know, like one, uh, well,
B:	was it last week, we were supposed to talk about gardening
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and it was really funny,
B:	I, I, I mixed it, made the call,
B:	and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it was really.
B:	We were laughing,
B:	I mean. But, you know, we don't really do any gardening,
B:	so like, that took like a minute
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, I mean.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Interesting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I mean, some topics,
B:	really now, you know, now, this topic, this is, I mean,
B:	there really isn't much to say after you know, you, uh, you know, you, you tell the person what, uh, news there, uh, you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied,
B:	and that's about it, really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's hard to talk for five minutes on this
A:	Yeah
B:	So, um.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess I can just say I, it bothers me that I hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,
A:	well, it seems like, I don't know, some things are sensationalized or some things are, um,
A:	you know, you'll hear one report
A:	and then you'll hear that it, you know, they didn't, um.
A:	Okay.
B:	So, what are your favorite shows?
A:	Um, I like watching COLOMBO and, um, MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	yeah.
B:	QUANTUM LEAP?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did you see it the other night?
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	That was, that was pretty good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that one was.
A:	What about,
B:	What do you,
B:	with the psychic and everything?
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like, uh, I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT.
A:	Oh, I, well I haven't seen either of those
B:	You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Oh, it's a great show.
A:	Um, I also like to watch STAR TREK,
A:	but it's on so late here, that I don't always get to see it
B:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we like it, too.
B:	Have you seen the movie?
A:	Uh, I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it,
A:	and they're, you know, already out with number six by now,
A:	but. So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet,
A:	but I.
B:	Oh, you haven't seen any of them.
A:	No.
B:	Oh, well, they're good,
B:	they're real good.
B:	They're, uh, they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which ones are you watching, the new ones?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen quite a few of the older ones.
A:	I haven't seen really the new generation that much.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the the newer one?
B:	Well, they're, they're a lot different.
B:	But, I like, I like the older ones because at that time, you know, they were really futuristic, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real futuristic, too,
B:	but I like, I like both of them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do too.
A:	I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot,
A:	I mean, he almost hates the new ones
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something,
A:	but, I don't
B:	No.
B:	Not really.
B:	It's not really like   a soap  opera,
A:	Oh, I think,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, but it's,
B:	but that's true,
B:	I mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff,
B:	but that's the way all shows are now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	sure.
A:	Well, let's see.
A:	Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's sort of how Matlock is,
A:	but COLOMBO is way tricky
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them.
B:	Well, it seems like they always  show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college,
A:	Well, did you see the one.
A:	Um.
B:	or is this, is there a series on.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	there's like one on,
A:	well we see it Thursdays at seven,
A:	and  it was,
B:	Okay.
A:	this last time it was about this, um, movie director,
A:	did you
B:	Yeah,
B:	I saw that one.
A:	did you see that?
B:	See, that was a rerun.
A:	Really?
A:	Oh, I guess I
B:	Yeah,
B:	I wondered if that's
A:	Huh.
B:	see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what,
B:	but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,
B:	and then, then they keep showing them over and over.
A:	Oh, I guess I've, I haven't seen it before.
B:	He was a movie director,
B:	and he had that gal killed.
A:	Yeah
B:	Okay.
A:	yeah,
A:	on the set or something.
B:	That was pretty good though
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though
B:	No kidding.
A:	I don't think so.
A:	Well, STAR TREK'S on at five,
A:	but I'm never home
A:	so,
B:	What is it that,
B:	there's something I watch, something I watch on Saturdays,
B:	and I can't remember what it is.
B:	Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS.
A:	Oh.
B:	You never saw that?
A:	I've heard of it a lot,
A:	I've heard of,
A:	a lot of people somehow or something
A:	They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	that was a different soap opera.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, it was, it was a different type of show.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I didn't like the way it ended, though.
A:	Oh, did they end the whole series?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they didn't, they only did it for, I think, two years.
A:	Oh.
B:	But it's all over now.
A:	Oh, another show I like to watch is MASH.
A:	So. How's your products been?
B:	Um, I really haven't had, uh, too many problems.
B:	Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out.
A:	I hear that one.
A:	Have you had any lately go out?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,
B:	and they,
B:	unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,
B:	and, uh, I really don't have any recourse,
B:	so I had to call and have them all repaired and that.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was a hassle.
A:	So you didn't get anything,
A:	even, all the, all the warranties were out?
B:	Yeah,
B:	the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,
B:	the
B:	the refrigerator warranty's still good,
B:	but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,
B:	and it was three years and two months.
A:	You're kidding.
B:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we just moved into a new house, too,
A:	so we had to buy all those, too.
B:	Uh, watch out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the only thing I've had problems with is, um,
A:	I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,
A:	and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.
A:	So.
B:	Um.
A:	I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,
A:	I just ended up using it.
A:	But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong.
A:	But.
B:	I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,
B:	but I just, uh,
B:	it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,
B:	and the the ice maker was, uh, had to have a new pump,
A:	That's incredible.
B:	and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,
B:	and they, uh,
B:	the dryer had to have a new heating element,
B:	so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.
A:	And they all went out at the same time?
B:	Uh, within two days of each other.
A:	Or two days.
A:	Wow.
B:	I was,
B:	it wasn't a good week.
B:	I was pretty mad.
B:	And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,
B:	so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,
B:	but still they were through that retailer,
B:	so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.
A:	Wow,
A:	it's frustrating.
B:	But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.
B:	So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I,
B:	the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, uh,
B:	I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	they go out a lot?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had two or three of those go out.
B:	One was under warranty,
B:	and the other two weren't,
B:	but, I just,
B:	other than that, you know, T V and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with.
B:	I don't think products are getting much better though.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See I'm in the manufacturing
A:	home from work
A:	and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's interesting.
A:	At Morton International,
A:	and, I
A:	well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment.
A:	We test everything after each assembly process,
A:	and so our testing is pretty thorough,
A:	but.
B:	Do you, do you test each individual one
A:	Um.
B:	or do you just test,
B:	like if you've got ten, you test one,
B:	and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?
A:	Um, the tests that,
A:	well, we test every one electrically.
A:	We don't,
A:	I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,
A:	so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,
A:	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,
A:	so.
B:	Well, that's something I've never had to use,
B:	it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident,
B:	so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I think it's a great idea.
B:	I'm, I'm,
B:	seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
B:	but that.
A:	Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,
A:	it's incredible how much testing they have to do.
B:	Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they.
B:	But, uh, even,
B:	you know, I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if, you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm not a real big seat belt,
B:	my, uh,
A:	Well Jackie, uh, on taxes, I, I guess I would have to say, that I, that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes.
A:	Uh, what's your feeling about that?
B:	I agree.
B:	I think taxes are high.
A:	Right,
A:	uh, where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	In New Hampshire we have, uh, uh, no, no, what we call broad base taxes.
A:	No income tax and no sales tax.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, we tax business, uh, eight percent,
A:	businesses are taxed eight percent
A:	and we have what we call the five B s. Uh, for our taxes. Booze, uh, butts, cigarettes, beds, uh, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, we do have a very low tax rate,
A:	but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes
A:	and .
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree
B:	and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting,
B:	well if you do get money back from like jobs,
B:	I'm still a student so, uh, I only work part time,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	so I, I get a check back
B:	so
A:	Well that's nice.
B:	from, from taxes
B:	but,
A:	Nice, nice to get a refund.
B:	Yeah
B:	It is,
B:	but it's not much.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay that, uh, we are getting value for it?
B:	No.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state
A:	and they say they are going to send some back,
A:	it's like giving yourself a it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know what I mean?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, it, it really, uh,
A:	I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because,  Right because, uh, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
B:	Yeah.
B:	There you go
A:	and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
A:	and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, uh, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I,
B:	don't seem like they are doing much with it,
B:	I mean there's plans there
B:	and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They have nice plans
B:	and, uh, but, they don't always work
B:	and then you know they try to raise taxes more
B:	and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,
B:	you know, but taxes get raise
B:	so. I don't know.
B:	I'm not really into politics, uh
A:	That it,
B:	I don't really understand it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's just you know
A:	Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.
A:	Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.
A:	There would be no figuring.
A:	I mean you would take your income tax,
A:	you would have a certain amount,
A:	I mean you would take you total salary
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,
A:	and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,
A:	and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.
B:	Right.
B:	Huh.
A:	And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S
A:	and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The could be nice
A:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	I, I'd like to see something like that.
A:	I think it would be fairer
A:	and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
A:	and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,
A:	but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
B:	Right,
B:	huh.
A:	It doesn't seem fair to me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it isn't,
B:	there is not much out there that is fair,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Right.
B:	Huh.
B:	I will agree to that.
A:	I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I, I, if I am not mistaken, aren't they? I mean for your state.
B:	Uh,
A:	What is, do you know what your state income tax rate is?
B:	Um, no
A:	Twenty percent?
B:	I, I have no idea,
B:	I just.
B:	My dad does it all for me
A:	Just, you just pay it, huh
B:	I use,
A:	You're like, you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts
A:	and, uh, she works as a waitress
A:	and she is attending college full time also
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she sends her taxes to me
A:	and I figure them up.
A:	She really has no idea.
A:	She gets a refund check
A:	and,
A:	Okay.
A:	How do you keep up with current events?
B:	Um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work, uh,
B:	usually catch the news in the morning.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what what channel do you watch or what station?
B:	Uh, N B C.
A:	That's the one I watch.
A:	I usually keep up with T V.
A:	I don't,
A:	I am a student
A:	so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, T V, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are
B:	and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.
A:	The stations I listen to are just mainly music.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you think that T V is, uh, pretty accurate.
A:	I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
A:	or,
B:	Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed
B:	and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, you know?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's
A:	they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Also, also I have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's something wrong.
A:	Going,
A:	they're, looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think, you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they typically have a better.
A:	I am from a small town too here in Texas and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	the farm report.
A:	Yeah,
A:	farm report and oil reports.
A:	That's pretty pretty sad
A:	or who killed who.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television .
B:	Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, in, uh, in Dallas, I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's
A:	and the story was, uh,
B:	Was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And the news covered it right, you know, hours after it happened
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they were taping people who were crying who had everything
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just thought that was really that's kind of cold,
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	I have seen that happen lots of times.
B:	You know, uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage
B:	you know we were on the scene with our team players
B:	and,
A:	Yeah
A:	and it was just,
A:	they were showing like these dead people
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and they were showing people crying
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I mean just taking advantage of you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They are trying to get the, you know, most emotional response for,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,
A:	but just the play on people's emotions
A:	It's just gotten so,
A:	I mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know
B:	Yeah
A:	and everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You know, I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down,
A:	Yeah.
B:	very,
A:	What did you think of the coverage of the war?
B:	Uh, I I found it very one sided.
A:	Did you?
B:	Uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, you know, not saying that we that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,
B:	but it just seemed like, you know.
A:	They kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing
A:	and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they kind of you know,
A:	if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,
A:	Think about, uh, taxes.
B:	Well, I think they're a necessary evil.
B:	Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, uh, businesses operate on
B:	and that is, uh you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in.
A:	You spend what you have
A:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that, the general idea is to you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy,
A:	but they're running under the
A:	you know, the way they're running it now, they're you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession,
A:	so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running,
A:	so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt,
A:	you're not going to payoff what you owe,
A:	but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay you know, get what you pay for.
B:	Well, I,
B:	it just depends.
B:	Uh, uh, roads are very expensive, uh, commodity and so is, uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, uh,
B:	you know, they need to make a living.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There's,
B:	So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I agree with that.
B:	But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
A:	I guess,
A:	I'm, I'm a student right now
A:	and I don't make a whole lot of money
A:	and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.
A:	I go to a state sponsored school
A:	and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,
A:	so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.
A:	My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,
A:	but, uh, I usually end up getting money back.
A:	I will this year anyway from a,
B:	Uh, you're very fortunate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I am
A:	I need it, too,
A:	otherwise,
B:	We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,
B:	uh, we pay in a substantial amount. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We don't regret paying taxes.
B:	We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And progressive tax, I think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money,
B:	and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.
A:	More taxes you pay.
B:	It should be, I think, a flat percentage
B:	and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Isn't,
B:	Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I totaled them all up
B:	and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
A:	Wow.
B:	Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well isn't,
B:	But, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh,
B:	like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.
B:	You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The taxes that people don't think about that,
A:	yeah,
A:	the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
B:	But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was that,
A:	which
A:	was it Jerry Brown,
A:	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a I think a flat percentage, something like that.
B:	Yeah
B:	if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money
B:	and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
A:	That's, because until, like eight,
B:	And so,
B:	Based on that, who do you think you're talking to,
B:	you're talking to an employer.
A:	Up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,
A:	Well, actually, uh,
A:	I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas
A:	I don't think I agree with,
B:	Oh really.
A:	No.
B:	You don't believe in it?
A:	Uh, I wouldn't say that.
A:	I think I would have said that a few years ago.
A:	When I was younger I thought it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment
A:	but, um, uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.
A:	I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment
A:	but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought
B:	You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She has very, very black and white opinions, you know.
B:	There's no gray in her opinions, you know.
B:	She, she probably would agree more with you
B:	but, but I don't know.
B:	I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again.
B:	I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we see that more and more.
B:	Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, that's fourteen years old.
B:	What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,
A:	but, uh,
B:	No
B:	it doesn't
B:	but, it costs less.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, that's a factor.
B:	And, yeah,
B:	to me it is.
B:	I mean, I work and I pay my taxes
B:	and I lived out in Texas for a little while
B:	and they're
B:	and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia
B:	I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia.
A:	Right.
B:	But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.
B:	If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I,
A:	the cost is something
A:	but it's, but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, dealing with crime
A:	and I guess I would like,
A:	I don't know,
A:	the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment
A:	and they  they don't have a crime problem either.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	No,
A:	you can't,
A:	they don't execute anybody in Britain or France
A:	and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either
A:	and they don't have the crime problems we do.
A:	I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing
A:	and the, that, that bothers me.
B:	You might be right.
A:	But it,
A:	but, uh,
B:	I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know,
B:	I would never in a million years want that job
A:	Huh.
B:	but I do believe it's necessary
B:	and I,
A:	Yeah.
B:	On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
A:	Huh.
B:	and I couldn't pull the switch
B:	but, uh,
A:	Well actually I,
A:	the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.
A:	I think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians
A:	so
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed, uh, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.
A:	I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and  nor the other way around.
B:	What  what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing
A:	Uh, I guess I'm, I'm,
A:	my view of uh,
A:	my,
A:	I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else
A:	and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered
A:	and, uh  I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.
B:	Oh, gosh
B:	Oh yes,
B:	if it ever touched my
B:	I don't know what you drive now.
B:	I mean, what do you drive now?
A:	Uh, I have a Ford pickup
A:	and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan. And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	so, uh
B:	Throw them in the back.
A:	they sort of fit our requirement.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh, seat  with a seat in the back.
B:	Cab.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	And so they just fit in there.
A:	When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.
B:	Yeah
A:	Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room
A:	and, uh and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back
B:	There you go.
A:	and I kind of like having a pickup truck.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Actually, I think of it as a as a car that'll last
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	I know.
A:	I like the way trucks are built
A:	and I don't care about comfort.
A:	So, I'm pretty happy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you're looking at,
B:	I got a Toyota Four Runner.
B:	I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too,
B:	so I got a Four Runner.
A:	So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.
A:	I, I never buy new
A:	so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.
B:	You're just like me.
B:	I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.
A:	And, uh, yeah,
A:	I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz.
A:	I'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine
B:	No.
A:	and I'll pay for the rest of it.
B:	Let somebody else break it in,
B:	right
A:	Right.
A:	And, uh, the van we're
A:	we might go again on a, on a van.
A:	We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.
A:	I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years
A:	but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon
B:	Right.
A:	and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, it certainly had that.
A:	We didn't do much to it at all.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my, my,
B:	pretty much the same.
B:	I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.
B:	I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds
B:	so I can tow everything
B:	and it,
B:	I can throw,
B:	I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's real reliable,
B:	I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now
B:	and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world,
B:	but it blew a head gasket.
A:	Uh-oh.
B:	Didn't do any damage to it.
B:	Uh, I caught  it real early.
A:	How,
A:	at how  at how many miles?
B:	Uh, oh ninety-seven thousand.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it's not real early
A:	You didn't overheat it?
B:	No.
B:	Never overheated it.
B:	I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Went out and looked.
B:	Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.
B:	Drove it right to the shop and left it off.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well that was, ,
B:	And that was it
B:	because I, I have that
B:	and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.
B:	It, it's a
B:	I don't know,
B:	people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
A:	I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining
A:	and, uh, uh, he's a,
A:	it's,
A:	he's pretty conservative guy.
A:	I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, uh,
B:	I know
B:	but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.
A:	I'm sure he does,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know,
B:	when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving?
B:	Yeah.
A:	No
B:	And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least. Just for  the enjoyment.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh .
A:	Yeah
B:	But, yeah,
B:	I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,
B:	uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.
A:	Right.
B:	I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very,
B:	I mean you got one.
B:	It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
B:	and,
A:	If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.
B:	Right.
A:	I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.
B:	To have it out of the way.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, they're solid.
A:	Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,
B:	I think they last a lot longer than anything else.
A:	They're the only things Americans still know how to build
A:	and, uh
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	the trucks do.
B:	Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too.
B:	But so are the,
B:	though I think the Chevies,
B:	I don't think the
B:	I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.  At least until recently
A:	Right.
A:	I  I kind of like mine,
A:	yeah,
A:	so, mine's a Ford
B:	A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck.
B:	I mean, I don't like Dodges at all
B:	but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.
A:	Oh, I heard about that,
A:	yes.
B:	Oh, it's beautiful.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That thing, that thing will last forever I mean ,
A:	That, that's a serious truck.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that thing's, uh,
B:	it's got a boat engine in it
A:	Right,
A:	this, uh,
A:	I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's pleased with it.
A:	Well I haven't had an awful lot of, uh, incidents regarding child care.
A:	When my two year old was in New Orleans, she got bit on the cheek
A:	and, uh, but, uh, that's about the, the, uh, the extent of it.
A:	But, but, but when,
A:	I really am, am concerned about is that, uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, uh, uh, you know, investigation for, for, uh, you know, child molestation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, and I, and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your, your, your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place
A:	and they don't pay very much
A:	and why, why would they be interested in, in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing
A:	and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that
A:	but my wife didn't work
A:	and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well I am a working mother
B:	I have three children
B:	and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young,
B:	I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements
B:	and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it.
B:	I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home
B:	and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children.
B:	My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.
A:	Huh.
B:	So I, I, I,
B:	you know, it is a problem.
B:	And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities
B:	and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford.
B:	When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.
A:	Huh.
B:	And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools
B:	and they were really all day preschools
B:	and they were wonderful.
B:	And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.
A:	Oh, well that's interesting.
B:	But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune.
B:	I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.
A:	Oh, my God.
B:	So.
A:	Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
B:	Well, I
B:	I'm a physician. Uh  and, as is my husband.
A:	Oh, well, yeah
B:	And, and I felt, uh, very good about working.
B:	I'm a pediatrician actually.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
B:	but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,
A:	Well, not, not all of us.
A:	You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for.
A:	I'm an engineer.
B:	Oh. Well
A:	And,
B:	I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in.
B:	And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh,
B:	I'm with the university actually
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three
B:	and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work.
B:	And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing.
B:	And they had wonderful,
B:	they had things like gardens and lots of pets
B:	and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that, that sort of an,
B:	most of the teachers had degrees. Uh,
A:	Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's incredible.
B:	It was incredible actually
A:	Oh, oh.
B:	But it was good.
B:	I mean it was, it,
B:	at that time there were two children
B:	and they were in special programs
B:	and each one was a little over two hundred a week
B:	and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra.
B:	But the kids were,
A:	Well.
B:	I mean they really had some great opportunities.
B:	But,
B:	what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,
A:	Yeah.
B:	sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.
A:	You know,
A:	they could,
A:	somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare
A:	and you know, that's a good starting wage
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	even that, that really, I think, I don't,
B:	it's been awhile since I've looked at,
B:	my youngest child is eight.
B:	So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers.
B:	But they are
A:	Huh.
B:	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .
A:	I mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit.
A:	But mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven
A:	so you know, that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
B:	Something like that.
A:	Oh my.
B:	Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children.
B:	I mean it has been a real, uh,
B:	there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences.
B:	And I think, I think they have captured a certain market.
B:	Again the,
B:	but then there are baby-sitting groups.
B:	As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Hi, Cynthia.
A:	What did you wear to work today?
B:	Um, let's see.
B:	What did I wear to work today?
B:	Um, actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.
A:	So, can you dress pretty casually?
B:	Um, on occasion. On occasion.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I do vary.
B:	Um, you know, I wear suits,
B:	I wear skirts and sweaters.
B:	On occasion I can wear jeans.
B:	Um, how about you?
A:	Well, I, um, run a business out of my home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I tend to get up in the morning, put on, sweats, um, do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting with a client, I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.
B:	Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.
B:	I, um, don't like to wear heels, that really tires me out.
B:	I work in a big building.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.
B:	Um, you know, in the winter I wear sweaters,
B:	in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.
A:	I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	That's helped me a lot with having,
A:	I can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since I'm only, working part-time right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but still, it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	accessories,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	What about your casual wear?
A:	Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
B:	Um, yeah
B:	mostly.
B:	I mean, at home I predominantly wear laughs while saying remainder of sweatpants and things like that, also.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, they're, um, you know, they're like
A:	Dress shorts.
B:	yeah,
B:	they're like black corduroy Bermuda shorts.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,
B:	and I get really a lot of compliments on them.
B:	Um, where I work is predominantly male.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know, they,
B:	their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks, you know, jeans, whatever.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but ,
B:	And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
B:	but seems to work for me
A:	Yeah,
A:	but .
B:	In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,
B:	it's one of those skorts,
B:	you know,
B:	it's shorts but it looks like a skirt.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I think that'll be good for work, too.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It'll be comfortable.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	I guess down here, uh,
A:	we just recently moved to Texas,
A:	so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, we moved from Colorado where,
A:	and I have a closet full of sweaters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That,
B:	Well, see, I live in Virginia.
A:	You live in Virginia, now?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, I'm,
B:	you know, like right now, today was in about, you know, the fifties.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'd like to be able to wear those here.
A:	Today it's eighty-eight degrees.
B:	Oh, my
A:	So
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes here.
A:	This is pretty unseasonal,
A:	but, uh, at least, we,
A:	you know, it, it, it feels good,
A:	it gets, uh,
A:	everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.
A:	It's nice to get, out and about.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing
A:	Okay.
A:	Sounds good.
B:	Okay?
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	it was nice talking to you, also.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Hi.
B:	Hi,
B:	um, okay
B:	what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of music do you like?
A:	Well, I mostly listen to popular music.
A:	I, uh, listen to it all the time in, in my car,
A:	so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials.
A:	But, uh, I find myself listening to popular music,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, quite honestly, I, I have some little children
A:	and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately,
A:	but that's not by my choice.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, um, I don't have that, I don't have that are experience to share
A:	Lucky you.
B:	I, I do, I do listen to a lot of,
B:	you know, I do, I switch the stations a lot because I don't have a cassette player in my car.
A:	Um, um. Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, uh, however, I, I do, I do like a lot of different forms of music
B:	so I switch quite often.
B:	Um, I think I like,
B:	I, I'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, the, uh,
B:	there's such a wide selection,
B:	I think I like a lot, I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music.
B:	You know, I, I, I like music that is, that I feel
B:	if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if the version is done right, I like it
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, if, if it's not, then I won't.
B:	I, I really don't,
A:	How do you feel about rap music?
B:	Rap.
A:	It seems to be so popular these days.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I, I don't really have anything against rap music.
B:	I,
B:	the one thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant, or, if it's, uh, violence oriented.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	I, I have strong objections to that.
B:	Um, actually I listen to,
B:	one time I remember, this was back when, even, uh,
B:	I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I,
A:	When it was really just starting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right
B:	when it was just starting, I heard what was called talking blues, which actually is rap.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it was about,
B:	the, the piece of music, the piece of music was about, I think about forty or fifty years old.
B:	And, it was incredible, I mean, the parallel, you know, between it and rap.
A:	Right.
B:	And, um, you, you listen a lot,
B:	if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel, uh, uh, especially well, the black gospel.
B:	You know, you will, you know, you can really pick it up. I mean,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you really.
A:	It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.
A:	A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, they're not original, but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, sounds, it sounds so much different
A:	and yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music
A:	and, uh, she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to,
A:	and yet, she thought they were brand new, original pieces.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, you know, like standards, I guess you could call it.
A:	That's right.
B:	I think it's kind of absurd, you know, the fact that, you know, they don't really, they don't really give, you know, the original artist, or the original composer, the credit that is really due to them.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess there was even a, a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer, who's really, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	seems to be the hot one of, of today.
A:	He used, um, WILD THING.
A:	Do you remember that, that song.
B:	Yeah.
A:	he used, um,
A:	I can't remember who the artist was on that.
B:	Jimi Hendrix was the original.
A:	Who?
B:	Jimi Hendrix was the original.
B:	He wrote
A:	Was it,
A:	well, maybe it wasn't that one.
A:	Because, it was a living, it was a living person that I'm, I'm thinking of that, um, that said, "You know, hey that, those are my words."
B:	Okay.
A:	And, uh, I guess that they, because they hadn't originally gotten, um, permission, from him to use it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know
B:	it may have, it may have been somebody else, because I think, I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it,
B:	I think that was a
B:	you know, come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, like a John Lee Hooker song, or something,
A:	Maybe so.
A:	I, I, can't think.
B:	I mean it was just like,
B:	it was really old.
B:	I mean I, I,
B:	there are a lot, there are so many different songs,
B:	I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times. I mean I've heard some songs that, that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of,
B:	I'm like, you know, I, I don't want to listen to this. Because you know, you think of the original is like,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, oh, that was really great.
B:	That was a, you know, a really good piece of work,
B:	and then when you hear the cover it's like, you know, God, what are they doing.
A:	Right.
A:	They destroyed it.
B:	I, I think a good one was, um,
B:	there was a Peter Frampton song,
A:	Oh, yeah!
B:	and, then the cover version, I think, I mean, I thought, was absolutely, it was pitiful.
A:	I, I remember seeing the video of it on M T V,
A:	and I thought it was hideous.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I did too.
A:	It was,
A:	ugh, I didn't like that either.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but you know, whatever became of Peter Frampton.
B:	I mean, there was nothing,
B:	he was a phenomenon,
B:	I there was no reason for him to really come into, you know, great stardom or anything.
A:	I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think, I think it,
A:	I think it was in high school.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	He was very good.
A:	I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh, Philadelphia.
A:	It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.
B:	Oh man.
A:	Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've, I graduated back in seventy-nine,
B:	so,
A:	Um, um. Uh-huh.
B:	but, but I've really,
B:	I, I loved,
B:	I mean, I was, I was really into the album oriented music, even then,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I was really familiar with a lot, with a lot of, of the A O R type music.
B:	Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor, and, the, uh, the Beatles,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go, they're better than the Beatles,
B:	and I'm like, you know, you don't know what you're talking about.
A:	No
B:	I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just,
A:	You can only laugh
B:	Yeah,
B:	you just sort of,
B:	you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you know At this point.
A:	Right
A:	well, they,
A:	I guess our age is showing when, we, we think that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.
B:	I think, um, um, when
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh, back in the mid and early eighties.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then, um, I don't know
B:	music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.
B:	I think that,
B:	I mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world music. Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music
B:	and,
A:	Like Paul Simon.
A:	Like,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	Paul Simon.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, really that's not world music.
B:	But, what, what Paul Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know. drawing from a lot of different sources and making, you know, a synthesis of a new type of music. Um,
A:	Yeah.
A:	What do you mean by world music?
B:	Well, world music is, um,
B:	a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,
B:	and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say another audience, let's say a North American.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and, you know, sort of, um, trying to draw out the best sources.
A:	Um.
B:	The, the best of every type of music.
A:	Right.
B:	Because, I mean, there are some, I mean,
B:	I, I
B:	there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,
B:	but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that I, I completely like heavy metal.
A:	No.
B:	I, I think,
B:	you know, and it's the same way with,
B:	you know, world music takes the forms that have really been, um,
B:	I guess, I
B:	you know, the best example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say,
B:	and then, and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,
A:	So then it becomes a kind of music of, of its own, so to speak,
A:	or, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it becomes a kind of music of its own.
B:	I mean, when you listen to it, it's um, uh,
B:	I think that they don't use,
B:	some of it,
B:	it's,
B:	they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles.
A:	Right.
B:	But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.
B:	I, I, I,
B:	a good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis,
B:	and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar, if you can believe it, I mean,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	You know, he's a jazz performer,
B:	and then he's playing with Robbie Shoncar,
B:	who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.
B:	Uh, arrangement to, uh,
B:	we're going to have to get off.
A:	The,
A:	are they trying to ,
B:	I don't know.
B:	But, uh,
A:	We've talked our five minutes though.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	but, I mean, when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.
A:	I've been listening to that a lot lately.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I listened
B:	and, I heard,
B:	you know, you hear this guitar,
B:	and then you hear the muted trumpet.
B:	I
B:	me,
B:	and you never would think that they, that they can actually play together
B:	but,
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	Okay,
B:	I don't know,
B:	which end do we push
B:	but okay,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, um, let's see,
A:	I, I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be heard
A:	and, you know, there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States
A:	and that, you know,
A:	their, vote's not going to make that much difference
A:	and whether you vote for one person or the other person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in,
A:	and that person is going to have a lot of, uh,
A:	since there's so many issues, this one person can believe a lot of different ways on, all of them
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	so, it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.
B:	That's true,
B:	you know, a lot of people, uh, uh,
B:	I think the, that it ends up the people that, uh, vote every time, uh, elections come around are more the, the polly, uh, the party type followers, the guys that, uh, you know, follow the party lines, you know,
B:	and, they, you know, just go in
A:	Yeah.
B:	and if they're Republican they vote Republican every year, you know,
B:	and, uh, the people that are independent, you know, are the ones that don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year because they can't seem to, to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's good.
B:	I always thought
B:	it was back when Anderson was running, I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes,
B:	but, um that didn't work.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you know, the real, uh, far side of the Democrats
A:	they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the Democrat party being liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of,
A:	it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like, uh, moral standings and those kinds of things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, uh,
B:	and then, and then people always get upset about it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more votes, huh?
A:	Yeah
B:	I'm always amazed at that, that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, that's true.
A:	I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections, I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that, uh,
B:	I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately Catholic type area,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	and when things start, uh,
B:	when, when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh,
B:	this particular community is a Catholic community
B:	but, uh, uh, down in D C where, where things are a little bit different, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,
B:	and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,
B:	so elections start getting very, uh,
B:	the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can understand why, why some of the, the rural areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the, the Midwest,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and, uh, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put,
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one thing, to get elected,
A:	and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.
A:	You know, that's, uh,
A:	with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do.
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.
B:	I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.
A:	Right
B:	Uh,
A:	Right,
A:	after the war.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That really, uh,
B:	Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot
B:	so they won't even bother turning out.
A:	Uh, that's true,
A:	yeah.
B:	They'll just say, oh, well, you know, the Republicans have this election
B:	we'll see you in four years.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	hope some of the local,
B:	well that's what they, they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the, at the booths,
B:	they, they say that these older voters that, uh, you know, they, they feel like the kids are running the, the country
B:	so they, they don't come out, turn out to vote
B:	and they're the ones that, uh, you know, really know what's going on, have the experience and seen, you know, how politicians can, you know, screwup or what ever.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years.
A:	Right,
A:	that's,
A:	you know, neither has mine as a matter of fact.
A:	And, uh, that's true,
A:	they, I think they look at it as, well everybody, the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true, because, you know, that's what the media says.
A:	Well, the majority believes this way
A:	so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their, uh, opinions.
A:	So that's, that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in your knee, the whole time your talking
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you hear the dogs in the background here?
B:	No,
B:	I can't hear them.
A:	Okay,
A:	they're,
A:	the children next door just opened the fence
A:	and they went off.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah.
A:	But anyway, that's,
A:	I guess we've, uh, talked long enough
A:	and, uh, that was sort of interesting.
B:	Yeah
A:	What part of the country are you from?
B:	Uh, Washington, D C,
A:	Are you really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow.
A:	This is,
A:	I'm in, from,
A:	this is Dallas where I'm at.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	The outskirts of Dallas.
B:	Well, I figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few, uh, Texans on the line now and then.
A:	Yeah,
A:	do, do you work for T I in any way?
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	Wow,
A:	how did you, how did they get you?
B:	Um, they , they went through engineering companies,
A:	Oh.
B:	and, uh, we're communications.
B:	I, I work in a communications company.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	right.
A:	I work for T I
A:	so, we saw it on the, uh, T News one day
A:	and I thought, wow, that might be interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	sort of different.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They called me at, uh, ten o'clock one night,
B:	that was very strange.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess they were doing Eastern Standard Time.
B:	I was like,
B:	I don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Central Standard Time is what they're doing it by.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet
A:	but, I didn't study it that hard
A:	so maybe I'll figure it out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, anyway, it was nice to talk to you and, uh, sort of meet you,
A:	and, that was an interesting topic.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, if your ever in, uh, D C, come look up Wayne Sherman , you'll say oh, yeah, talked to that guy.
A:	Okay.
A:	I'm, I'm Kyle Hunt, too, if you ever come to, to Dallas area.
B:	Oh.
B:	Okay.
A:	We live right by the airport.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	so do we.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right next to Dulles.
A:	Yeah.
B:	All right, I'll talk to you later
A:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	Back by that.
A:	The, uh, uh,
A:	you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman, how women have changed,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, look at them,
A:	in England, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, uh, Indira Ghandi , uh, in India,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so many, uh, women are heads of state
A:	and I, you know, we, we keep saying oh yes, we feel some day a woman will be president.
A:	But, uh, I have some question, whether or not they will ever really get around to that.
A:	I think we'll have a black president before we have a women president.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I don't know whether that's bad or good,
A:	it's just a point that I have observed that we,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I, I truly believe that, that before that, that we have to address the racial, racial issues in the United States, before we can go anywhere.
A:	Yes.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, because it is so, you know, it's,
A:	Uh, oh.
B:	Hello.
A:	Uh, oh, I think, we're, we're supposed to hang up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well it wasn't the matter of wealth,
B:	it was the matter that they were not wealthy, that made them equal.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, I'll talk to you later,
A:	All right.
A:	Thank you.
A:	Bye, bye.
B:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, what do you think about, uh, the idea of having volunteer service for everyone?
B:	Uh, I think that, uh, really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service.
B:	Uh, and, you know, I mean, there have been so many people that have done it
B:	and I've talked with several
B:	and I think they've gotten a lot out of it.
A:	Well, are you doing any kind of volunteer work now?
B:	Not right now,
B:	but I have done, uh, Red Cross work
B:	and, uh, I've taught C P R training
A:	What about, when, when would people do it, when they finished high school?
B:	I think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, if they go straight into college I think they're going in too quick
B:	but,
A:	I think particular boys that the maturity,
A:	in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school
A:	and I think there's a, there's a real challenge there.
A:	There's also this, this issue of, of, uh, you know, whether you're really ready,
A:	and I think it gives a different perspective.
B:	Right,
B:	uh,
B:	I, I think if you've been out of school a year, year and a half, before you start to college, you appreciate college more, than someone that just goes right straight into college.
A:	The only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this?
B:	Well, a lot of parents fund their children.
B:	There are, uh, some groups that have their children, you know, go away for a year.
B:	Even the religious organizations.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the Mormon church has, sends out missionaries that,
B:	Right.
B:	And the parents fund them for the whole year, year and a half that they're gone.
A:	That's, uh, it's interesting.
A:	It gets them away from home and, and gets them to do something useful,
A:	although the kids today, though, it, it seems that almost that their concern for money,
A:	I, we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in, in trying to find a job, study something that will give them a job as opposed to, be curious, be curious
A:	as to if,
A:	if there was, if there was mandatory, you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary,
A:	do you think that would be reasonable?
B:	I think it would.
B:	In, in Israel, the, even the women are, are required to, to be in the military for a certain period of time.
B:	Uh, I was in the military,
B:	and I personally feel if, if they have the draft, that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men.
A:	Well, but, the, the issue of, of, of, which,
A:	what, what would, what would you find, what would you have them do?
A:	You know there are a lot of people around with,
A:	there's a lot of unemployment right now.
A:	What would you have these people do if they were brought in?
B:	What, into the service?
A:	Well, yeah.
B:	Or,
A:	Or say, say the volunteer,
A:	say that, say that it was mandatory.
B:	Well I, I, I think that they ought to have something for the, the unemployed in a voluntary field like the, uh,
B:	I don't know if you know, remember about the W P A,
A:	Yes,
A:	my father was in the C C C .
B:	He was in that?
B:	I mean, you know, uh, it's not the best thing in the world,
B:	but, uh, it gave them something to do.
A:	Well, it seems that there's some things like the, uh, the programs at least just go around and, and, and clean up streets and, and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things.
B:	or go into the, the more depressed areas and help repair the houses.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in fact, we, we helped with, uh, oh, Help To Help Humanities,
A:	and that was a, that was a good experience,
A:	but you take the kids out
A:	and and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that, that either need demolishing, or need fixing up,
A:	so
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it would be a good idea.
A:	Uh, we've been doing this three or four minutes.
A:	I think that, uh,
A:	do you have any other further comments?
B:	No,
B:	not really.
A:	Well, it was good talking to you, Betty.
B:	okay,
B:	I'll talk to you later.
A:	Have a good night.
B:	Bye.
A:	Uh, books.
B:	Yes.
A:	Mainly I read the Bible these days.
B:	That's very good.
B:	I do, too.
A:	Good, that's great to hear.
A:	Uh, and Christian literature.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I've kind of,
A:	I used to read a lot of, uh, novels,
A:	but it seems as though if you really want to set a side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever, uh, that pretty well takes up your time for reading.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does.
B:	It,
A:	And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart
A:	and he really has.
A:	It's getting, to where a just really want to read it.
B:	That's good.
B:	That's good.
B:	It, it, it's, uh, it's hard for me to find time, also, to read.
B:	Uh, a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that for, you know, because I don't have a lot of time,
B:	but when I do get to sit down and, and read, I like to read the Bible
B:	and I like to read,
B:	I read to my daughter a lot, too.
A:	Do you?
B:	And, uh, I like to read, you know,
B:	I have Bible storybooks
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so I like reading those to her
B:	and she really enjoys those.
B:	So that's good.
B:	And it, and it's kind of short because we don't, woe don't have a lot of time, to, to read,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, it's real enjoyable. For both of us.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's?
B:	Frank E
B:	no
B:	I guess I haven't.
A:	Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, uh, uh, I forget the the other,
A:	well he, uh, he's also written a lot of children,
A:	how old is your daughter.
B:	Five.
A:	Five,
A:	okay,
A:	he's written some children's books as well
A:	and they're all spiritually, uh, oriented,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	yeah.
B:	What's his name again?
B:	Peretti
A:	Frank E Peretti,
B:	Frank E Peretti
A:	P E R E T T I.
B:	I have to look for those.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	do
A:	because, uh, I love to read his, his, uh, children's books just
B:	Just to read them.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, they're good,
A:	they're great.
B:	That's good.
A:	And it's like, uh, uh, usually about a family of, uh, archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into, like, uh, uh, digging in old ruins, and running across, like, uh, the old gods and things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that sounds pretty neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	It's real exciting.
B:	Oh, I'll have to look for those.
A:	And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know,
B:	Right.
A:	so,
B:	Well, that's neat.
B:	Well, I I have a,
B:	my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like that because it's a, it's real easy to, uh, follow for her,
B:	you know, uh, gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it.
A:	Well, it's hard for me.
B:	That's right
B:	It is, it is real hard to, to follow and understand,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I've got a Bible that, uh, has a little bit of a, uh, a glossary in the back
B:	and it helps explain who people are.
B:	That's, that's about the hardest thing is, who's related to who
A:	I know it,
A:	and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes,
B:	it sure is,
B:	but, but it is good reading
B:	and it's good for us, and and everything.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	I really do enjoy it.
B:	But, uh, I also,
B:	but then on the other extreme I like to read, uh, uh, I guess I don't know, horror, Steven King type books.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I've read a lot of his, too.
B:	The,
B:	and I, I like that,
B:	that's good fun reading.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Can't put them down.
B:	No
B:	you can't,
B:	you really can't.
B:	They are good
B:	and ooh they just, they're just so suspenseful.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	I really do enjoy his.
A:	Uh, there's another guy.
A:	Oh, what can,
A:	what is his name
A:	Oh, durn
A:	you would, well
A:	you know when you're recording you can't
B:	I know
A:	Uh, oh, Dean, uh, Kratz, or Kranz
A:	or,
B:	Judith Krantz?
A:	who?
B:	Judith Krantz.
B:	I know her.
A:	Uh, no,
A:	it's a guy.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And he, he writes the same thing, though.
A:	It's that real, gruesome horror stories.
B:	Oh.
B:	Ooh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Koontz.
A:	Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, I think I know who you're talking about.
B:	Uh, I've seen,
B:	I don't think I can pronounce it either,
B:	but
A:	Yeah, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm in a book club
B:	and I think I've seen his books in there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've never read any of his.
B:	But they're real,
A:	I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though.
A:	It seems like it's all the
A:	did you ever read the, uh, uh, oh,
A:	it's one of his first books, THE STAND.
B:	Yes.
B:	That, oh, that long thing.
A:	I know it.
A:	And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that, I mean.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do kind of follow or, Are similar.
A:	You know, that,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I love that book, though.
A:	I thought it was great.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really was,
B:	and I loved THE SHINING.
A:	Ooh, yes
B:	That was, that was my favorite.
A:	Oh, those hedges when they started moving.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Whenever they they made that into a movie, I was thinking oh, my gosh if they show that, I'll just die.
A:	For some reason that scared me more than anything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is,
B:	he just brings stuff alive, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You could just visualize everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's,
A:	And that was a pretty scary movie, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they did a pretty good job,
B:	but they didn't follow it exactly,
A:	Yeah
B:	but they did give it, you know, do it justice.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right.
B:	But, uh, most of the time they don't with, when, follow books very well when they make them into movies
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	I liked IT as well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah, uh,
A:	That's, another big fat one.
B:	I did, too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was good.
B:	I liked, uh, I also liked, uh, CUJO.
B:	Did you read that one?
A:	Yeah,
B:	And,
A:	except it broke my heart.
B:	Yeah,
A:	I'm a dog lover.
B:	Me, too
B:	And then, uh, NIGHT STAND,
B:	is that NIGHT,
A:	No,
A:	it was, uh,
B:	DEAD, DEAD ZONE.
B:	That's one I liked.
A:	What?
B:	DEAD ZONE.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That was a,
A:	I've read that one, too.
B:	That was a real good one.
A:	He's written a lot of books.
A:	Boy, he just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job.
B:	I know it.
B:	Right,
B:	and then he has some under, uh, another name. That he's written.
A:	That's right.
A:	That one about the Gypsies, or that, hunger
B:	Yeah.
A:	or, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I think his name was Bachman.
B:	He wrote under the name of Bachman.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Richard Bachman.
B:	Yeah.
B:	He is really interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's so prolific.
B:	Yeah
B:	Ooh, I wish I could do that
A:	Oh, I know it.
A:	And I have gone back
A:	and, after I, I graduated, I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I do, too.
B:	I love old, good old,
A:	Once you can get into the language,
A:	you know, the
B:	Yeah
A:	It's like, it's English,
A:	but it's not the same English they speak today.
B:	Right.
A:	So it's kind of hard to keep, you know, at it,
A:	but
B:	That's true,
B:	but I,
B:	That's, that was one of my favorite subjects in school was, uh literature.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me, too.
B:	I used to love those old, good, good old books.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I didn't mind doing that at all
A:	Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I liked, uh, oh,
B:	gosh why can't I think of their names,
B:	uh, shoot,
B:	the one that wrote, uh, WUTHERING HEIGHTS.
A:	No,
B:	No
B:	that was another one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, well, you know who I'm talking about
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	those are good old good old books and classics,
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	that's right.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	Sure is neat
A:	That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen, because they'll take a classic and, and, uh, televise it you know, put it into a viewing format, more or less.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know it's, it's really hard for me.
B:	I work two jobs and uh, have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school, myself,
A:	Do you?
B:	so it's, it's hard for me to sit down and read,
A:	Well, I can imagine.
B:	but when I do I just, just love it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	me, too.
A:	Well, I think we've accomplished five minutes
A:	so,
B:	I think we have, too.
B:	Thank you very much.
A:	It's good talking to you.
B:	You, too.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, what is your view, do you consider the Soviet Union a threat?
B:	I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a,
B:	well, you know, it's, it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a, of, of a threat it is, I guess,
A:	Sure.
B:	it, it takes awhile to, to get used to something,
B:	you know, if, if they have completely
B:	on the, place has completely turned that much around to where they're not, you know, not what they used to be,
A:	Right.
B:	uh
A:	It's, it's hard to, to know anymore if it's a, a threat one way or another because, uh, it used to be so, much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell, you know, rank and file in behind it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And now that with Gorbachev is introducing more, I guess, freedoms or expressions of freedom, it doesn't look as though, you know, everybody's following the same pattern.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, those,
A:	the people who are, you know, the staunch military conservative people,
A:	you never know, well, Gorbachev's future is like whereas, whereas in the past it was seen as, you know, whoever was the head of the, the communist party was seen as, you know, untouchable.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I
B:	yeah,
B:	the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so, uh, dramatic that you almost think, now wait a minute, you know, we're getting stuck into something here, you know,
B:	if, if somebody's about to, to clobber you, the first thing they do is sort of say, well, you know, we're, we're ashamed, we're not going to do that anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And, uh, um, you know, I'd, I'd like to think that that isn't true
B:	but I, I,
B:	you know, the evidence is that, uh, you know, he's, he's let some, some stuff go, you know, the east German situation.
A:	Right.
B:	It's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible,
B:	you know, if I'd have been asleep for five years, and read it in a book, I said, no, no, no, that didn't, couldn't have happened that way.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on, you know, both economies that our economy is, of course, been able to, uh, withstand that a little better,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, the Russian economy
A:	they, you know, they,
A:	I don't know what the percentages are,
A:	but I heard it one time,
A:	it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And finally, you know, who knows
A:	maybe they're finally waking up and saying, you know, we can't afford this.
A:	Uh, the U S isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be, you know, even if they're saying that beneath the doors.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Even if it is, you know, the best thing in the long run, it just steps on too many people's toes, who are comfortable with the way the situation is.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think, you know, what I'd have to,
B:	I, I I guess to answer the question directly, I'm still just a, a little bit, you know, leery of the whole thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What I haven't seen is the, uh, you know, a great stepping back in the military, situation.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, it's, it's one thing, you know, to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
B:	and, you know, I even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just a, a deal to go ahead and let us, uh, you know, expend some, some military hardware.
A:	Expend?
B:	Of course, it didn't turn out that way.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, that, that may have been a, a, a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know.
A:	Well, it's interesting, anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism, philosophy that, that was here in, you know, twenty years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but, of course, the people who have challenged that or tried to do, have have not been world powers.
A:	So, it's easier for us to say, you know, to an Iraq, you know, uh, you can't do this, get back, you know, or we're going to force you.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	or, or we can do something about it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Whereas, you know, if the Soviet Union would have, who knows what taking over Mongolia or, or something like that, who is really, will we have been more just rhetoric, uh, rather than going in there officially or, you know, physically and try to, to remove them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, the, the China situation, you know, the when, it looked like that thing was, was turning around
B:	and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the, in the Red Square or wherever said, okay,
B:	and that's enough.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And,
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, that,
A:	personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat,
A:	and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward, you know, just some pretty hard by the socialism,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, the, the reaction, uh,
B:	you know, the, the economic,
B:	well, the, uh, the social structure of the Soviet Union, you know, it, it's, it's coming apart at the seams.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, and I've heard people say, well, you know, it's just like the American Civil War, will there be a union or not?
B:	Well, no,
B:	it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that, the whole Soviet system was put together under total force,
B:	you know, there was no,
B:	as, as we are seeing now with a lot of those, areas wanting out of it,
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, they, uh, nobody
B:	you know, a lot
B:	man , those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union,
B:	they had no choice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was always kind of interesting,
A:	people,
A:	you know, a lot of my friends have a taken us down, the stance of, you know, these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away
A:	and I'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic,
A:	you know, if I'm a Soviet and if part of, you know, south, let's say South Dakota wanted to you know, succeed, am I going to stand for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now I realize that the origins are, are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with, and that they may have been forced, I'm not that familiar with their future,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I, you know, I,
A:	it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than, uh, a volunteer or willingness to join.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	There, there was the whole thing was put together, you know, by force.
B:	There's, there's no, no real question about that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the three Baltic countries, you know, came in, in the forties,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's, well, it's not that they came in, it's they were conquered by the Germans,
A:	And then, just never given back.
B:	and then the Russians even, took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back, you know,
A:	Yep.
B:	so. That's a, a little different situation.
A:	Well, that whole a,
A:	the whole idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is, the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers
A:	and maybe, you know, more and more people are seeing, oh, countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you,
A:	you can,
A:	well, I guess like, with, uh, Israel is a perfect example.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The reason they have the Angolan Heights and the, the, uh, all their buffer area is between Jordan and the, the Sinai and, and Lebanon was just as a buffer
A:	but, you know, as you can see with the, the scuds go right over there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's, there's very little that, that binds you anymore in today's technology.
B:	I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts, all the bombs are going to go right over Germany
B:	and they're going to land in other places,
B:	you know, that's going to be the safest place to be.
A:	That's probably very true.
A:	that's very interesting, never thought of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, uh, I, I guess, what they'd have to do to,
B:	I really don't know,
B:	you know, in, in the, in, you know, I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, some reason or other, you know, is, uh, it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say, whoa, wait a minute,
A:	Nobody knows what to do.
B:	you know. What's, uh, what's, what's really happening here.
A:	Is it real?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you wonder how, well, this thing,
B:	who, was it Boris Yeltsin, the guy that's running the, uh, or evidently was elected president of the Soviet, for the Russian republic, which is, I guess, the, uh, the biggest,
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
A:	I get confused between all the, which is the Soviet provinces versus which are the, the Russian provinces, versus what are,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, in the center
B:	but you got a, the, the great big area that's just, was traditionally known as Russia
B:	and then all these little nationality groups, around it, you know, that were, you know, was there nineteen of them or, or whatever,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, and these were all the Soviet economists, us you know, they had some real fancy names for them.
A:	Right.
B:	Matter of fact when the,
B:	uh, yeah,
B:	what I read when the, uh, uh, United Nations was setup in, in San Francisco, one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the, uh, of these, you know, republics, as a separate country,
A:	Oh, as a,
B:	you know, so there would be, there would be nineteen, rather than one.
A:	as a vote.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
B:	And, uh, the United States said, well, that mean we get to bring in forty-eight, you know.
B:	And, uh, that sort of,
B:	you know, they backed down on that.
A:	Died down on that.
A:	I thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a military force,
A:	but it's merely an economic now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, wonder if that
A:	Well, I mean at ,
B:	uh, what do you get shot by something that's called a, an economic force or what is called a military pact,
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	you know, it's all,
B:	you can change the name of something
B:	but I wonder if it's still, exists.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Although, I've seen some evidence that, you know, the, uh, the Russian soldiers are,
B:	well, you,
B:	the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's, they're having housing shortages now.
B:	What do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by, uh, Bulgaria and, and Czechoslovakia
A:	Exactly
A:	and, and all the,
B:	and now all of a sudden they're going home
B:	and somebody's got to pay for their,
A:	Well, that's what they're saying the whole problem, you know, with, if we were to demilitarize Europe,
A:	what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's not,
A:	What's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a, a million plus people in the you know, in each country from the U S ...
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, since you live close, I don't know if you know, um, about what Louisville is doing with recycling,
A:	or are you familiar with any of that?
B:	Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, like the area in there,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I read, you know,
A:	when they first started doing that in the paper, and I read about that,
A:	I was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time.
A:	And, you know, we separate everything out, and then have to haul it up to a Metco , you know, which is a real pain.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	So if they would come up, curbside recycling,
B:	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.
A:	Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, God.
B:	Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons
B:	and there was nowhere else to take them
B:	and they had it in front of Wal-Mart
B:	and I ask in Wal-Mart
B:	and they said they moved it just behind.
A:	Oh.
A:	That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing.
A:	Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great.
A:	And we started taking them up there.
A:	And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know
A:	I didn't know.
A:	And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's really nice to find out that it's behind there
A:	Well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers.
A:	I couldn't even think of what you call them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.
B:	Like aluminum cans?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's about what we do too.
A:	And really, that's about, that's really about it.
A:	Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?
B:	Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,
A:	I know.
B:	I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.
A:	I know.
A:	I know.
A:	We're kind of the same way.
A:	You know, at first, you know, you,
A:	at first it was a real, it was a real hassle,
A:	and I'm wondering are we really going to do this,
A:	but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know. So I just go, you know,
A:	we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen
A:	and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there,
A:	you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
B:	Those milk cartons take up so much room.
A:	Oh, they do, too.
A:	And they're impossible to crush.
A:	I mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know.
A:	If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,
A:	so. You know,
B:	I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	We were using baby food
B:	and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Some of our neighbors were doing it
B:	and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it,
B:	and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there,
B:	and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff
A:	Oh, that will be good.
B:	so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.
A:	Sure.
A:	Let somebody get something out of it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	And they won't raise our taxes.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah .
A:	Ha-ha
A:	Well, I was kind of hoping with,
A:	you know, do you work for T I?
B:	No,
B:	I don't.
B:	I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,
A:	No.
A:	Yeah.
A:	There was a,
A:	T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs.
A:	And, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
A:	and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know,
A:	and that's,
A:	they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program.
A:	It's,
A:	you know, T I doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that.
A:	And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm kind of like, yeah.
A:	I shall,
A:	they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. That was going to use it for good,
A:	so,
B:	is talking to someone in Sorry.
A:	Sounds like you have a little one just like I do
B:	She'll be two in July.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Mine was two in December
B:	Oh.
A:	Well, it was good to talk to you.
B:	Well, it was nice to talk to you.
B:	I know they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives.
B:	They pick up newspapers, I think.
A:	Oh, do they really.
A:	Curbside pick up?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I really hope they do that in Louisville.
A:	It would make it a lot easier on all of us.
A:	Talk to you later.
B:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	So what do you think about it?
A:	How are we doing in recycling?
A:	Are we,
B:	Well, I think we need to do more.
B:	I mean, I know I need to do more.
B:	They have programs around where you can reach the, uh,
B:	they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I have a hard time of being able, of separating, you know, having a place, separating my trash,
B:	and get all the cans from the paper,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, you know, I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet
B:	So.
A:	I do a lot of work with the boy scouts,
A:	and we try to do a lot
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but there's still a lot more we can do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I don't recycle my newspapers myself,
A:	but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sometimes it just sits around for a while,
A:	and then we just chuck it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I don't, I don't get the paper every day,
B:	but, you know, I get it on,
B:	I try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know, the Sunday edition.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that up,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that's the extent of what I've done.
B:	I'd like to be able to do more.
B:	The problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know
A:	Yeah
A:	see, and,
B:	it's not always convenient to do it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, and here in Lubbock everything's so close.
A:	I can imagine what it's like up there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is,
B:	but, you know, sometimes it's just so,
B:	seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I put me a little five gallon bucket,
A:	and it's just outside the garage door
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
B:	Do those can crushers work good?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I got one from Payless Cashways,
A:	and it's actually metal
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's not plastic.
A:	I didn't want to buy a plastic one.
B:	Yeah
B:	because those things I think would just snap you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But Payless Cashways has them
A:	and they're metal,
A:	and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there,
A:	but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad.
B:	Oh.
B:	I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,
B:	but, um you know, occasionally we have some around,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't,
A:	yeah,
A:	I don't think it would crush steel cans,
A:	it's pretty tough.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so. I don't know,
B:	I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,
B:	but, I need to look into it more,
A:	No,
A:	you could probably just, you know,
B:	you know, it's, you know, it,
B:	sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,
B:	they won't take paper that's shiny,
A:	Yeah
A:	they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper
A:	or, see, I work at T I.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so does my husband,
B:	yeah.
A:	We do a lot of recycling out there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,
A:	but that's just now come on board.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,
A:	and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't know what,
B:	you know, I haven't,
B:	I'm sure they're probably doing that here some.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm sure they are.
A:	T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide, I'm sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it's necessary,
B:	I, I like it,
B:	you know, it makes,
B:	I think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal,
B:	they're now starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper,
B:	and, And I've bought, you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and I think they're just fine.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I bought a,
A:	I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work,
A:	it's his birthday,
A:	we're pretty good friends,
A:	and what it is is a recycled paper bag
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside,
A:	and it's just a paper bag
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, and it's really cute.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I think we're doing better and better all the time,
B:	Yeah
A:	still don't,
B:	I think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more.
B:	So.
A:	No,
A:	there's not going to be any room, shortly.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	the office,
A:	I don't know what New York does about theirs.
A:	I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere
A:	Yeah,
A:	so. But I think we're getting better at it
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think there's quite a bit more we could do.
B:	to someone in the Girls, put that away.
B:	Now.
A:	But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just wish it was a little more convenient to do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, seems like you're so busy anyway,
B:	and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it sure is.
B:	I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, they'll get at it sooner.
A:	I guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	get the kids interested in it too.
A:	You know they have,
A:	We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have,
A:	and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But what do you do with them in the meantime?
B:	That's right.
A:	Now I don't want a can, a garage full of cans
B:	That's right,
B:	who does.
B:	You know people don't have room for that kind of stuff.
A:	You know.
A:	No,
A:	they're just not, they're not prepared for it.
B:	No,
B:	and in Texas, they're just get, things like that,
B:	they just get bugs in them.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	they do.
B:	So, you don't,
A:	You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,
A:	that's for sure.
B:	That's right,
B:	so.
A:	So.
B:	I'm pretty lazy about it right now.
B:	Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, pick it up.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	myself.
A:	About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Well, I need to get, get better at it.
B:	So.
A:	Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then we'll get there.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's right.
A:	Well thank you for talking to me.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, thank you for calling.
B:	I,
A:	Sure,
A:	no problem,
B:	Okay,
B:	take care.
A:	All right,
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	I, I, I, assume you have kids in
B:	Uh, we have one.
B:	She's only nine months old.
A:	Oh, well she, she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, my degree is in teaching,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we have a little bit of a basis for conversation.
A:	I was a substitute teacher for about a year.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, thought I wanted to be a teacher
A:	so, but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and they, uh,
A:	in Alabama, where I came from they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree.
A:	So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.
B:	Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels
B:	or,
A:	Yeah.
A:	It was,
A:	I just took grades one through six.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong.
B:	Well, my degree was in fourth through seventh grade
B:	but I taught junior high.
B:	And I expected it to be a lot of trouble
B:	but it wasn't that bad,
B:	I taught remedial reading kids.
A:	Um.
B:	And, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days, they call it something else.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, but, anyway, at the time that's what I taught.
B:	And, um, you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way, when you have your slow readers
A:	Uh-huh and clicking noises in
B:	but it, it wasn't too bad.
B:	We, we got long real well.
A:	Well, I, I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up.
A:	I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have to you can get mean with them.
A:	Those little kids don't understand it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I,
B:	especially with the real young ones.
B:	I started out wanting to teach lower, like primary and then top primary and thought, well, no, I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth
B:	and so that's what I got my certification in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, and my reason for that was I don't like the, uh, what's the right word. The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools.
A:	Well, that's a nice way of putting it.
B:	You can find a lot of good public schools if you, if you look real hard
B:	but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach, your children on an individual basis.
A:	exactly,
A:	And too, most people don't have that option.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know. And plus it also depends on the district your in as, I mean, on the,
A:	I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do. Uh, accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know
A:	Back when I was going to school uh, you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean you, you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and, uh, usually bending over to get five of the best,
B:	Yeah
A:	Um, but now, nowadays they can't even, they can barely scold the children for something, you know, without getting sued.
B:	And the, the, um, the crime is just escalated and the drugs and, even in the, in the the, the lower, the lower schools.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, the thing that really did it for me, I was subbing in a fifth grade class
A:	and, uh, this kid comes to school with his lunch box
A:	and inside this lunch box he, he's got easily two, I'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills.
B:	Um.
A:	And I asked him, uh, what are you doing with that?
A:	And he says, "My father gave it to me."
A:	And I didn't believe it for a minute.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Um, so, uh, but, uh, you know, the,
A:	not a lot I could do about it.
B:	Right.
A:	Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants.
B:	Crazy for him to
B:	but,
A:	Well, I have,
A:	I, I, I've
A:	I think I understood what the, what the kid was doing he was a, uh,
A:	well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But not a lot I could do about it.
B:	Well, we had the problem when I was in,
B:	with teaching, um,
B:	I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with
B:	and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you don't know if you were reaching them or not
B:	but we felt like, you know, maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was trying to teach them was better than have them taken out.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because, uh, uh, that just,
A:	that doesn't do a lot for them.
A:	I mean it, alleviates your problem
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it doesn't do anything for them.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh, most the time if they were, they were,
B:	some of them were even better behaved.
B:	I've only had two instances where I it was really noticeable
B:	but they were better behaved when they were, um,
B:	I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on
B:	but it ended up better
B:	but,
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	guns and,
A:	I don't know
A:	it's something.
B:	I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to, um, to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, you know,
B:	they've been a big drive in, especially in the seventies to return back to the basics.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and I'm not completely just, you know, just teach the basics in schools
B:	but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, sure.
A:	I mean, it's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong.
B:	Right.
A:	And when you see, uh, Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the, uh, science jobs, all the engineering jobs, all the mathematical jobs
A:	and, you know, here we are
A:	we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I don't know.
B:	Well, I spent a year and a half in Japan also
B:	and I've seen how their school system works
B:	and I,
B:	they go by a complete rote system,
B:	you just memorize everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then at the end of the, of a certain time period you spitted everything back out
B:	and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I don't completely agree with that either.
A:	No.
B:	But there, there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, that's a great deal what law school's like
B:	Oh, is it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Is that what you ended up going into?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, I did the same sort of thing,
A:	they just,
A:	you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases
A:	and then you get one examine for the whole semester
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's how well you can remember it all.
B:	How, how much can you stuff in your brain.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I found that a particularly useless way of studying.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I never did.
A:	I always tried to understand things, not tried to memorize.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories
A:	but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
A:	It didn't show me anything.
A:	A year and a half, I gave it up.
A:	I wasn't really
A:	I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway, just wanted the degree.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well,
B:	Well,
A:	I don't know.
A:	What can we do about it?
B:	good question
B:	Probably,
A:	Money, Money is not the answer.
B:	Taking,
B:	No.
B:	There's plenty of money in the system,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's just,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, they're throwing more money at it now than ever before
A:	and things are getting worse.
B:	I think it's like a lot of things in the, in the United States.
B:	We've got so much built up in, um, in the, in the, uh, bureaucracy and in the politics of it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and in the, the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
B:	and there's no way that, that can be done.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Not without wiping out a whole generation of, of kids in the school system,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Maybe on smaller, smaller scales.
A:	Well, I don't know
A:	I, uh,
A:	as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it, from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I mean, it's, it's silly that these, that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right into the classroom it needs to be be able to be enforced.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Exactly,
A:	I mean, I, I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something, to students because they're going get, they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's like doctors in lawsuits,
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	you know, they're kind of fearful of, everything.
A:	Well, lawyers help create that
B:	That's, that's,
B:	well, at least I've heard that
B:	I, I, I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's, been applicable to me
A:	Well, I think, I think, I, I mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers
A:	you know, somebody,
A:	okay,
A:	we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day
A:	and he's out of our hair.
B:	Right.
A:	And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they're just,
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	it has to be reinforced in the home.
A:	Oh, sure.
A:	I, I
A:	you, you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's, it's not going to help either.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I don't know,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I don't know what the answer is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's an interesting, interesting thing you want to do.
A:	I,
A:	how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools,
A:	do they allow it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	They allow it under certain circumstances.
B:	You have to, to prove that you're teaching them something.
B:	You have to follow, a preferred curriculum,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be, they're kind of monitored.
B:	You know, they, they will allow you to,
B:	I can't think of any examples
B:	but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence.
B:	And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't think they're were in this area
B:	but, um, they, they are monitored by the, um, by the State School Board.
A:	Um.
B:	So.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	I remembering reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that and they got sued. Got taken to court by the school system.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm glad the parents won.
A:	I mean, it seems silly that, um, we started
A:	that's, that's the way you got your education in this country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then, um,
A:	I don't know.
A:	I grew up, uh, in the, the sixties,
A:	and at that time, uh, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess
A:	and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and, and thereafter
A:	but have since, uh,
A:	I grew up in a small town in, in southern Oklahoma
A:	I have kind of gone back to, uh, more of a county, uh, flavor in music.
A:	Um, I'm not quite sure why that is
A:	and it seems like almost a opposite,
A:	but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, uh, sounding music.
A:	It didn't have what, you know, I guess what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a, a story.
A:	It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up
A:	and I've, I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years.
B:	When you say that you grew up, uh, in the sixties I take it that was the, uh, teenage type years
B:	or, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was my teenage years.
A:	I was born in fifty
A:	and, and, uh,
B:	Okay,
B:	we, we're very similarly aged,
B:	so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times,
B:	so I'm just a couple years older than you,
A:	Yeah.
B:	um, essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music,
B:	but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me,
B:	uh, my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college
B:	and I became attached to that style of, uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it.
B:	Uh, over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical
B:	and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it, it very relaxing for me.
B:	My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, uh, Simon,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's something that interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned.
B:	And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music.
B:	I'm not a music, um,
B:	, I'm not particularly schooled in it.
B:	I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music.
B:	And I, I spent a good deal of time listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, Neil Diamond, for instance. Um, people of, of that particular time,
A:	That's kind of the way I am.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I listen to some country and western
B:	but I'm not schooled in it
B:	and I, I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it.
B:	I played a little bit of piano.
B:	I continue to do that.
B:	I want to do it
B:	and I never have the discipline to stay with it,
B:	but when I do play, uh, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for a new piano player.
A:	It is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone.
B:	Right.
A:	And it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into.
A:	I'm kind of the say way,
A:	I, I've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical.
A:	I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I, I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there,
A:	and
A:	was support,
A:	I was influenced by all different kinds of music
A:	but basically because that's where I worked.
A:	And I've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music.
A:	He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music, uh, that they were using behind them because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons
A:	and so consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there
A:	and I think that, uh, got deep seated into me.
A:	One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, uh, are those that call on those classical, uh, roots, I guess, uh, Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about,
A:	but he does have some things.
A:	Chicago had some things,
B:	Right.
A:	uh, and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music
A:	and I'm still, still,
A:	my favorite,
A:	in fact most of my C D are classical music.
B:	I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music.
B:	I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation.
B:	Uh, a good example would be, uh,
B:	I have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH
B:	and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY
B:	and both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows,
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, and I, I've, uh, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested,
B:	but it's the music, almost that I find myself listening to, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm kind of thinking that's maybe,
A:	our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, uh, things now with the music that's behinds them.
B:	That could well be.
B:	I, I, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when I,
B:	a song by the, uh, uh,
B:	I think the title of it was just Downtown,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da,
A:	Right.
B:	uh, all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away,
A:	That's their signal.
B:	They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that's right.
A:	When did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson?
B:	Uh, probably about first grade,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I have, uh, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it.
B:	I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes
B:	and then inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things,
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh,
A:	It is a time consumer.
B:	It is.
B:	In order to continue to, to grow and
B:	I, I always think that I'll be able to do it
B:	and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted, in composition themes
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I,
B:	keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them.
B:	I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved,
A:	Right.
B:	uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude
B:	and I keep thinking, gee, I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand
B:	but, but it doesn't for me.
A:	No,
A:	it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.
A:	I was never able to, to master all that.
A:	In fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing,
A:	and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again,
A:	they sold the piano,
A:	and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to,
A:	so I,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that's one of things I felt like I missed in life
A:	and I, I really,
A:	in fact, uh, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, uh, piano.
A:	I just, you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that,
B:	Oh, ,
A:	maybe one of these days, I'll,
A:	you know, I'm kind of like you, maybe one of these days I'll get around to it,
A:	I'll do something with the piano,
A:	but probably not.
B:	So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, uh,
A:	Just never got a chance to come out.
A:	No.
B:	That's the most fascinating thing
A:	Well, it's a pleasure talking with you.
B:	And you, sir,
A:	Best, of luck in your graduate school.
B:	take care.
B:	Okay.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Good-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	do you want to go first?
B:	Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic.
A:	Fitness and exercise.
B:	Oh, God
B:	No,
B:	why don't you go first.
A:	Okay,
A:	um, I like to do, uh, weight training and, and cycling. And just walking, uh, swimming.
A:	I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall.
A:	And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore,
A:	so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit
B:	Well, let me ask a personal question,
B:	how old are you?
A:	Thirty-eight.
B:	Oh, well then you should
B:	see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop .
A:	Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape
A:	it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to.
B:	Oh, you're lucky then
B:	because I've battled arthritis all my life,
A:	Really?
B:	I mean even since I was like about two or three.
A:	Oh.
B:	Then they diagnosed it,
B:	and usually most people are just absolutely crippled,
B:	and, uh, I do water aerobics. Religiously do water aerobics,
A:	Oh, I bet that helps.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I used to do it about six times a week
B:	and now I'm down to about four
B:	but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in in there,
B:	uh, I tried weight training
B:	and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift the things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And the shock on the system is, is just too much,
B:	so I have stuck to water aerobics basically, you know, the weightless thing and, trying to keep this shape that way
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, you know, it's hard to find.
B:	I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are,
B:	I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way, to get in shape, without having to spend anything
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	or it's the geriatric crowd.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it.
A:	Well, I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself,
A:	and you probably do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but you have to have an indoor pool.
A:	This is true.
B:	So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity
B:	you look very odd in the water,
A:	Well, that,
B:	that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training,
B:	and that does look very odd in the water.
A:	I can believe that.
A:	Have you tried the, uh, the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center?
B:	No,
B:	and you know, that's the only place I haven't tried
B:	and people have told me.
B:	Now that's the Texins facility?
A:	Yes.
B:	I have been told that thing is just lovely.
A:	It is.
A:	They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round.
B:	Huh.
B:	do you use that facility a lot?
A:	Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, uh, more on the weekends,
A:	uh, I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center.
B:	Huh.
B:	Do you know if they have child care there?
A:	Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet?
A:	You need to put that on there, seriously.
B:	They don't,
B:	I don't, I don't work at T I.
A:	Oh, you don't?
B:	No,
B:	I used to work at T I,
A:	Oh.
B:	as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position
B:	actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry
B:	and I used to fill out those attitude surveys,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other
B:	and my husband still works there,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, um, I get my attitude expressed through them,
B:	but I find it to be very
B:	sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks.
A:	This is true.
B:	Uh, and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I
B:	and I came down here
B:	and, you know, they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here
B:	and I asked about, you know, day care for the shift workers,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, you know,
A:	Well, it's not,
B:	it was not applicable to me
B:	and I was kind of horrified.
A:	Now what year are we talking about?
B:	We're talking nineteen seventy-eight.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, things have become much more enlightened since then.
B:	They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, we still don't have a day care facility
A:	but people are more sympathetic to it.
B:	I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care,
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	and, uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. Um, I had been rated number one in the field
B:	and then I took, uh,
B:	when I became pregnant I also got meningitis, and then delivered the first baby three months early,
A:	Oh.
A:	My gosh.
B:	and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home,
B:	and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment.
A:	Could you hold the phone for one second,
B:	Sure.
A:	Thanks.
A:	Okay,
A:	I'm back.
B:	And then they used to, uh,
B:	and then I had a second one eighteen months later,
B:	they told me to put them back to back
B:	and, of course, to maintain
B:	and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one, because that's when I go into labor four and a half months
A:	Wow.
B:	and I don't even know it.
A:	Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	very easy,
B:	very easy
B:	and they, they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was going,
B:	and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor.
B:	I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof, because it was a, uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill,
A:	Really.
B:	but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that was when they had,
B:	God it would have been the eighty-five layoff,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I'll tell you how they handled this
B:	and I was just outraged,
B:	I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later
B:	and they didn't have any coverage under my name
B:	and I went back
B:	and I said what the hell is going on here, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really.
B:	And they told me that, uh, oh, well, you know, you know, your husband works here
B:	and he's got a good salary
B:	we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway,
B:	and, uh, you know, we've got people here that really, you know, need to be working
B:	and so that we had just,
B:	you know, it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person
B:	and we'd just let you go.
B:	And it took me about a year of arguing,
B:	I said, you know, I've got to put this in writing to me, and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I couldn't get my, uh, termination benefits either.
A:	There you go.
B:	I was just pissed as hell that they could do that.
A:	I, I can believe that.
B:	But I, I guess things have gotten better,
B:	I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things ,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	flex time is great.
B:	I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again
A:	I, I can understand.
A:	I can understand.
A:	Well, it's been good talking with you.
B:	But let me ask you this, since you use Texans,
B:	how much is it a month?
A:	Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.
B:	Now that's for individual.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something
A:	it's no big deal.
B:	That's it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking?
A:	Uh, you do for classes, for classes,
A:	but to, I mean to use any of the facilities is, is no extra charge.
B:	God, that's cheap.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
B:	That's really cheap.
B:	Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or, Or a
A:	Or, or a
A:	or a dependent of one.
B:	God, I am so dependent these days.
A:	Really.
B:	It's a sense
B:	Oh, seen that my, my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence.
A:	Wonderful.
B:	Yeah
B:	So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment
B:	but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans.
B:	I really think I am,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it's great.
B:	Huh.
B:	All righty.
B:	When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell?
A:	Uh, well, it would depend on when you go
A:	it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.
B:	See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty
A:	Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.
A:	If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site.
B:	Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line.
A:	Oh, well, then you could go either one,
B:	Yeah.
A:	the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities
A:	and you'd probably like the pool there.
B:	Oh, God it sounds like I would.
B:	I might do that then.
B:	Okay,
B:	I learned something here.
A:	Well, good.
A:	I'm glad.
B:	You can go back to work now.
A:	Well, thank you.
B:	Thank you.
A:	You have a good day.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	um, I guess, um, this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do, uh, hand work.
A:	Uh, mostly I do needlepoint, I guess.
B:	Oh really.
A:	But, um,
B:	What kinds of things have you done?
A:	Um, well, I've made a lot of baby gifts
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It seem like that's,
A:	like, especially lately there's been so many babies, that, uh, bibs and blankets, and things like that. Wall hangings, um,
B:	Do you ever keep any of your stuff?
A:	Isn't that funny.
A:	No
B:	I do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that,
B:	and I have very little of my own stuff,
B:	and it's kind of embarrassing.
B:	People say let me see some of your work.
B:	Oh well, can you do it ?
A:	Yeah,
A:	isn't that funny.
A:	I guess I do have one thing.
A:	A friend of mine gave me a clock kit
B:	Ooh.
A:	and, I, I needlepointed the face,
A:	and I, uh, kept that because she gave me that.
A:	So,
B:	That, that would be definitely something you'd want to keep.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And it's real neat.
B:	Was, was the whole face done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute marks?
A:	Um, basically, the whole,
A:	well, no,
A:	I guess the minute marks,
A:	but the minute marks are done, they're like hearts.
B:	Oh.
A:	And then the,
A:	at the numbers they, they're kind of outlined and stuff.
A:	It, it was quite bit of work,
A:	but, you know, it was a lot of fun, too.
A:	I really like doing stuff like that.
A:	So.
B:	I did some needlepoint years ago,
B:	and then I got into the Bargello.
A:	Oh, what's that?
B:	Well, it's an Italian, um, needlework, using, using the uh,
B:	I started to say the canvas,
B:	but the, uh, huh,
B:	what kind of cloth uses that.
B:	I, I've just gone blank.
B:	But it's used with yarn,
B:	and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
A:	Huh.
B:	and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors.
B:	Like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever,
B:	and it was used quite often in the colonial times to, uh, uh, to upholster chairs, and so forth, as well as the crewel, um, embroidery work that was done on them.
A:	Wow, that's interesting.
A:	What did you, what kind of things did you do?
B:	What I did, when I was doing that was mostly pillows, you know, for sofas and so forth,
B:	and I can't find one that I've done.
A:	Oh.
B:	It's one of those things
B:	I I didn't give them away,
B:	but I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what,
A:	Yeah,
B:	and it,
B:	I was so proud of them when I got them finished,
B:	but I have no idea where they are.
A:	What did you call that?
B:	Bargello.
B:	It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O out the
A:	Huh.
A:	That's,
A:	I've never heard of that before.
A:	I've probably seen it, though,
B:	I suspect you, I suspect you have.
A:	I mean, when you described it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, when you described it, it sounded like something, you know, that would be around, I guess.
A:	But, I've never heard of it before,
A:	and it's really interesting.
A:	Um, I guess I've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past,
A:	but I've kind of gotten out of that.
A:	I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows.
B:	Me, too.
A:	Really
B:	Yes
B:	That's interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
B:	How did you know to choose this subject, tonight.
B:	That's funny
B:	What,
B:	how did you,
B:	what kinds of decorations did you use with the
B:	how were you decorating the baskets?
A:	Oh, basically bows and lace uh, ribbons.
B:	Um.
A:	Um. I really wanted to do,
A:	you know, so many of them now have the ribbons where, I'm not sure how they do it,
A:	but the ribbons, they make them, they like.
A:	I don't know how to explain it.
A:	They make them hard, you know?
B:	Like fabric that's been stiffened.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes.
A:	I've never done that,
A:	and those are so neat.
A:	I mean, I would really like to do those
B:	I've seen some,
B:	and there, there, they,
B:	I suspect they're fairly simple, because the one lady I've seen, I know that does it, I've never asked her any questions,
B:	but she has three kids all under the age of like six.
B:	And, and they're all a handful.
B:	So it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly.
A:	Oh, definitely,
A:	yeah.
B:	When I do, um, crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I stiffen those with a, a glue mixture.
B:	It's like white glue,
B:	and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then, um, allowed to dry in those, those draping bows, I mean, those draping streamers. I don't know.
A:	Oh.
B:	I was just.
B:	There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's I think that's what my concern was, was it really sure, and how they would, how they would last.
B:	Do you know what my concern is?
B:	How will I dust this thing?
A:	You're right.
B:	That's terrible.
A:	No
A:	that's true.
A:	That's funny.
B:	So many of my crafts,
B:	well, right now I'm looking at a little quilted, uh, uh, hanging,
B:	it's, like, it's a flag,
B:	and I don't want to wash it, because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth,
B:	but it's such a dust collector to be out, and so forth.
A:	Yeah
B:	And most of my things are dust collectors
B:	Uh, and I hate to dust.
A:	I know.
B:	So first thing I think of is how easy would this, thing be to clean.
A:	That's funny
A:	No,
A:	I do some,
A:	I have really gotten out of it.
A:	I don't do it quite as much as I used to. Um, I guess because I, I went back to school,
A:	so I don't have as much time.
B:	Oh, you don't have time.
A:	No,
A:	and I have two children also
B:	You definitely don't have time.
A:	It keeps me very busy.
A:	But I really enjoy it when I do do it, when I get the chance, you know.
A:	It's really,
A:	it's so relaxing to just sit,
A:	and, but once I get started, I can't put it down.
A:	I just,
B:	I have a similar problem.
B:	I've got to have time
B:	or I don't even want to get into it in the first place.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all.
A:	I know,
A:	I started a project, it's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas.
B:	You just didn't say which Christmas, right
A:	That's what I keep telling this person,
A:	well, I didn't tell you what year as if talking to other
B:	What was this project?
A:	Um, well, it's a, it's uh, cross stitch,
A:	and it's a picture,
A:	and it's a wildlife,
A:	it has deer and trees
A:	and, it's really beautiful,
A:	but it's going to be a lot of work,
A:	and you know, I've, I have worked on it quite a bit, but not as much as I'd like to.
A:	You know, it's just so hard.
B:	Now this is done in the needlepoint?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I
A:	it's counted cross stitch, actually, is what I'm doing,
A:	and so it's really, since it's counted, you know, it's really a lot of work.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes,
B:	I do know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I have done a little bit of that,
B:	but I decided that that's something that demands my my, my total attention.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I've got to have total, almost total silence.
B:	I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate.
B:	It sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yep.
B:	It is not, does not sound like an easy one to finish.
A:	No,
A:	it really isn't,
A:	and I tell you, really, I could just kick myself for even starting it, because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done.
A:	I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life
B:	Oh, I'm sure you'll get it done,
B:	but it just may not of the original,
B:	obviously not of the original time schedule.
A:	No,
A:	that's true.
A:	I, I just don't know when I'm ever,
A:	it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it,
A:	you know, it's just really hard.
A:	But I really do
A:	like I said I really enjoy it when I do.
A:	It's just hard.
B:	Just hard finding the time that can be dedicated.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there's, there's so many other things that, I, I have done, you know, in the meantime, like I said, so many baby gifts.
A:	I've made a lot of bibs, and wall hangings,
A:	and so, you know, those don't take much time at all.
A:	So it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them.
B:	Do you, do you use patterns, I mean, like a book of patterns,
B:	or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that.
A:	No,
A:	I usually just buy a pattern book.
A:	I have several pattern books,
A:	and I just go with those.
B:	Okay.
A:	And then I buy the bibs separate.
A:	Usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run,
A:	and then I just use whatever colors I want to.
A:	I don't usually use the colors they tell me to.
B:	Um.
A:	And it, it depends on what it is, you know.
A:	But some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, I just go with whatever I want to.
B:	That's what I would do, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Or whatever I have.
A:	There's yeah, there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very many.
A:	Real simple ones, you know, I do.
A:	I've made, I made a little, uh, little, uh, little thumb print and made it a bunny.
B:	Ooh.
A:	It was really easy.
A:	I mean, just, just did a thumb print. You know.
B:	What. With ink?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And then, see I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print,
A:	you know, that was just the ink,
A:	and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth.
A:	That was so simple
B:	Oh, that sounds really neat.
A:	It didn't take anything at all.
B:	Did you do, did you use, like, uh, a stamp pad and ink.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I just,
B:	Ok
B:	so you,
B:	just like being finger printed ...
A:	Okay,
A:	so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess?
B:	Um, a lot,
B:	well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie
A:	Obviously you have kids.
B:	That's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
A:	I haven't seen that one yet.
B:	That's an excellent movie.
A:	Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
B:	Oh, was that good.
B:	I heard,
A:	Uh, see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was a pretty good movie.
B:	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.
A:	I, I'm ready to go.
A:	It just,
A:	it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way yet.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, it's, uh, it looks good, you know if you like thrillers, anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	Right.
B:	And I do.
A:	In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.
A:	So
B:	Really.
B:	Oh, I love them like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm not,
B:	I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies,
B:	but I like that where they run tense.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really enjoy,
B:	they keep me guessing the whole time.
B:	It's really, it was really interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, what other movies have you seen then lately?
B:	Oh.
A:	Other than the,
A:	I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES.
B:	Yes,
B:	the new one, of course
A:	Is that any good,
A:	I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one.
B:	Oh drawn
A:	So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon.
B:	Amarillo.
B:	I didn't see the first one.
B:	My husband said it was, um, about the same lines.
A:	Oh, well, then it won't be too bad.
B:	So, yeah.
A:	You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily,
A:	but it was better than it could have been.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	And I was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know what I mean.
B:	It wasn't,
B:	my daughter's five,
B:	I mean she understood everything.
B:	She goes to almost all movies with us except, you know, R rated.
B:	And she really enjoyed it,
B:	but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did,
B:	and I liked that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's important if you're going, you know, if you're going, uh, kids are going to, uh, parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least you know, semi for them too.
B:	Right.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's pretty good.
B:	But we take her to just about every movie,
B:	and, she, uh, she does really good.
B:	We've taken her from real young,
B:	and she does real good.
B:	Like I said, we don't take her to R
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it.
A:	I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no.
A:	Do you take her, or do you go to a lot of comedy movies
A:	or to,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	What was the last comedy you saw?
B:	of to Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw?
B:	to regular Huh, huh, huh. Good question,
B:	good question.
B:	We don't get to go that often,
B:	but something on the tip of my tongue,
B:	and I can't think of which one it was.
B:	Uh. Gosh, I can't remember.
A:	The last, uh,
A:	in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I said that wrong,
A:	the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox.
B:	But that, that sounds good.
A:	Well, that really wasn't too bad.
A:	There were,
A:	you know, he's supposed,
A:	you know, he's this actor, right
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he's playing a cop.
B:	Right.
A:	Or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.
A:	I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I mean, there, there were times when he was, like, he'd be running with a gun or whatever.
A:	He didn't look like a cop when he did it.
A:	And I was so impressed with that because, you know, usually,
B:	That's neat.
B:	The part was hard, to do that.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	because, I mean, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to, you know, to imitate them or whatever.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Now, by the end he was looking more like a cop. But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, you know, he was trying to, trying to get it,
B:	Right.
A:	but he wasn't there yet.
B:	Right.
A:	And you could tell it,
A:	and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, you know, because I think, or directing job.
A:	I think they did a real good job of that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.
A:	I mean, you know, he just,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like him.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and there were, there were some definite, um, should I say, tense moments, with him in there.
B:	Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE.
A:	Yes,
A:	I, I, I had seen it before Christmas,
A:	but I took a date to it, uh, about a month ago.
A:	So, I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.
A:	So.
B:	It was really cute.
A:	I really enjoyed it.
A:	Of course, the bad thing about it was, uh, the second time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it as much,
A:	and I was kind of surprised at that.
A:	I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But before,
A:	maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time. I had laughed so hard I was hoarse.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I really was, I was hoarse getting out of there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it,
A:	I mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time because I had just gone overboard the first time.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know
A:	but,
B:	Maybe so,
B:	maybe so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, it was, it was a great movie though.
A:	I loved the movie.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did, too.
B:	I'm looking forward to this summer, uh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out.
A:	I love those movies.
B:	I do too.
B:	I mean, they are just slapstick drawn out for
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It,
B:	you have to see those twice to catch everything.
A:	Well, you have to see them more than that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I, I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, it's amazing
B:	I do too.
A:	I love those movies
B:	I do too.
A:	I really do.
B:	So I'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious, as they all do.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	Well, we we try to go a couple times a month, I guess to see a movie.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, it's just getting so expensive.
A:	Oh, isn't it though.
A:	You know, but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.
B:	But normally we don't think about it until,
A:	That's exactly what, I was going to say.
A:	I keep not doing it until after I'm there
A:	and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things.
B:	I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us.
A:	Easily.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	And then if you want popcorn and stuff
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both.
B:	You know popcorn is not that expensive.
A:	No,
A:	nowhere near that expensive.
B:	So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke.
A:	And, it, it's just the idea that these, uh, these actors, you know, live in such lavish style.
A:	I mean, it's as simple as that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We just keep breeding them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to keep paying them.
B:	I guess so.
B:	Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?
A:	Yes.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Oh, that was, that was an excellent movie.
B:	I haven't seen,
B:	we're waiting for the video.
A:	No,
A:	don't.
B:	No,
B:	really?
A:	Don't.
A:	That needs the big screen.
B:	Oh.
A:	It really and truly does, because to get the feeling of like when the buffalos are, when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh really?
A:	You really truly do.
B:	Oh.
A:	I would,
A:	I mean, I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video, too.
A:	But I'm glad I didn't.
A:	I really and truly am.
A:	I mean, that that was one movie I came out impressed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really and truly did.
A:	I mean, I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars.
A:	None at all.
B:	Right.
A:	Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one, one movie taking all the honors.
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I wanted him to win best actor on top of it,
A:	he was,
B:	Yeah, oh.
A:	Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But even though they were okay, the girl in it,
A:	they,
A:	somebody made an interesting observation,
A:	now that I think back on it, I'd say yeah, I can't believe that either.
A:	She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times.
A:	You know what I mean, you know.
A:	It was just too perfect at all times.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That was a mistake that they made.
A:	They shouldn't have done it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now the best,
A:	the supporting actor, he was good,
A:	but from what I heard, the guy who got it was better,
A:	so I, you know, I can see that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, oh,
B:	You think my daughter would like it?
A:	Oh, well there are, there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But, um, it's it's
B:	She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes.
A:	Okay,
A:	no problems
A:	It, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides.
A:	So there's,
B:	See, that's the one, that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie is because I love buffalos for some weird reason,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, well, And, and, of course,
B:	and I know they're fake.
A:	and, well, yeah,
A:	that, and plus, I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt.
A:	So, I mean, they are killing buffalos in it.
A:	But they don't stress that very much,
A:	they really don't.
B:	Okay,
B:	okay.
A:	And I think it's an excellent movie for,
A:	if, if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good.
B:	Oh, that'll be good.
B:	We really need some,
B:	my husband keeps wanting to.
A:	It's, it's, it's a long movie.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I heard the video's even going to be longer.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	They did a lot of stuff that they cut out.
A:	I may have to see the video.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	they said,
A:	I hadn't even thought of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they said there's a lot that had been edited, because of the length and that they wanted in,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so they're going to put it in the video.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that way you can watch it at your leisure.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I kind of like it when they do that, because the video, like I said,
A:	there are certain things you can't do with a video
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Because I mean when you rent a video,
A:	videos, of course, are not cheap either
B:	True.
A:	and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea. Because they, they make bundles of money off those things.
B:	I know it
B:	Isn't that ridiculous.
B:	We have cable which helps a lot
A:	Oh, I do too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but not enough.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we keep holding out, you know.
A:	Yeah
A:	I'm getting to the point where, you know, I watch, well I watch NICK AT NIGHT.
A:	Okay,
A:	do you have
B:	Are you there?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay
A:	There, okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	Had to mess with my phone here.
A:	Um, do you have children?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have one.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	How about you?
A:	I have three.
B:	Oh, my goodness
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, do you work?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do.
A:	Okay.
B:	I do,
B:	I work
B:	and, and, uh, Brian's in a day care center.
B:	He's uh, he was two in December,
A:	Oh.
B:	so he's not quite two and a half yet.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He,
B:	uh, I put him,
B:	I'm kind of had different, different ideas from what probably the majority of people have,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I put him in a day care center from the very beginning.
B:	He started in day care when he was eight weeks old.
A:	Oh, no kidding.
B:	And I just,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I have kind of the opposite opinion of most people,
A:	Really.
B:	I have had this real problem with a, a private individual.
B:	I mean I, I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a, with private individual, when the door shuts,  that one person has total control,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and if you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that can see it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They can watch,
B:	and I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because there's,
B:	You know, how can you help depending on the day care center, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers,
B:	have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, kind of thing.
A:	It's like a family thing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You never hear about it really in the big ones.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, that's what I did
B:	and I have had just excellent luck.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	I have been just so happy.
B:	He's,
A:	Oh, good.
A:	I was just going to ask you how it, you know, if you liked the, the,
A:	but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there, I know,
A:	but,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Well he was in, he was in the same center for two years, for the first two years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was wonderful,
B:	and I loved it,
B:	and I was so happy there
B:	and the woman who owned it sold it.
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	But, I thought okay, I'm going to keep an open mind here,
A:	Right.
B:	and the people who came in, it just wasn't, it,  just wasn't the same
A:	Wasn't the same.
B:	and their, their attitude and philosophy was just completely, opposite from mine,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I left him there for about a month and just decided I can't do this anymore,
B:	and I, moved him, which was an extremely traumatic experience
A:	Yeah.
B:	but. but, he's done well,
A:	Was it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	he's been there,  a couple of months now,
A:	Good.
B:	and I just feel so lucky.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's great,
A:	that's good.
B:	How about you?
B:	Do you work
B:	or do you get to stay home with them?
A:	Well, I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years.
A:	My oldest one is ten and a half now,  or she's, I guess,
B:	Wonderful.
A:	yeah,
A:	it's,
A:	was about ten years.
A:	So I, yeah, I, I was really happy that I was able to do that.
A:	But, I,
A:	that's what I wanted to, because I, uh, you know I just couldn't wait to have kids
A:	and so, if I was,
A:	I was so anxious to have them
A:	and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly, you know, to go back to work as soon as I had them,
A:	so,
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	so, it, it, it, it was really great.
A:	By the end of the ten years I was really ready to go back to work,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I bet
A:	and my youngest was only, uh, two and a half
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean she was already two and a half,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it wasn't, you know, she wasn't an infant.
B:	A baby.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, I felt real good about that,
A:	but, uh, boy, I tell you with summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out, in terms of what I'm going to do,
A:	I, I guess I, went back to work about a year and a half ago
A:	and, uh, I worked full time all last year
A:	and now I'm going to school part time and, uh, graduate school,
A:	and I'm working part time
A:	And, so I'm still,
B:	I know how that goes
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm still going full time,
A:	but I only have half time salary,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, when school lets out, I just don't, I haven't, I have no idea what I'm going to do, because I certainly can't afford what we did last year which was,
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Did you have them in a center or something last summer?
A:	Well, we did,
A:	we tried, we had all different things,
A:	we sent them to camp.
A:	One,
A:	first month, in June, they went to summer school, then the second month they,
A:	uh, one,
A:	my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son, uh, went to camp
A:	and there we had, uh, I don't know some,
A:	forget what else we did
A:	but it was all, uh, really expensive
B:	Yeah,
B:	that stuff is expensive.
B:	It really is.
A:	So, now they're a year older,
A:	and I,
A:	my daughter's eleven, going to be eleven this summer
A:	and my son will be, nine and a half.
A:	And so, I'm not,
A:	I think I can leave them home,
A:	for a,
A:	if I can work part of the day, you know, I'm going to leave them home.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I was going to say they're getting to the age where, you should be able to trust that a little bit,
A:	Right.
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	in fact I'm doing that right now with their afternoons, when they get home before I do. You know,
A:	that's okay.
A:	But, the four year old now I I have had her since I went back to work, or before I went back to work really, in a home day care situation,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we've just been really thrilled, with it too.
A:	We were what,
A:	actually we,
A:	it took us two or three different people to find,
B:	To find the right one,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that's what we have to do though.
A:	Right.
A:	But, I wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know,
B:	No.
A:	so, the, the person we found it through the,
A:	there's an association here in town of professional home, care providers or something like that.
B:	Where do, where do you live?
A:	In Plano.
B:	Plano?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they have a number you can call
A:	and all these people are registered with their association
A:	and, you know, go like our, our, uh,
A:	I don't want to call her a baby-sitter,
A:	she's doesn't like, to be called that,
A:	care provider.
B:	Care provider.
A:	Right.
A:	She goes to seminars
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh, that's wonderful.
A:	she gets home visitations by the I don't know, the state boards, I guess, some of them and then some by the association,
A:	and they have weekly meetings and everything
A:	and, so it's just really, really well regulated.
B:	That's great.
A:	And, she's just great.
A:	In fact, uh, she's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall
A:	and she says this is it,
A:	you know, I'm not going to have her anymore
A:	and I said, Oh, no, don't count on that
A:	After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	So, but, we, we've tried, we've tried everything
A:	and one year, I guess last year when I went back to work I had
A:	my son was eight at the time, just barely eight,
A:	and, uh, we put him in Amrein's Day Care, after. After,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I've heard that, they were very good.
A:	Well, that's why we picked it, because they were, were supposed to be real great,
A:	and, you know, I think they were fine,
A:	but the thing is he was in school all day, in second grade,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	in, in Plano, it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders in the same area with no walls.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's
A:	and then there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know what fun they had with these computer games
A:	and then they'd go outside for awhile,
A:	they had snacks and story time and everything.
A:	But, it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty.
B:	Poor kid was in school all day.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself,  and having some peace and quiet
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even at that age they need that time,
A:	Yes.
B:	we all need that time, just some quiet time to wind down from the day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	That's exactly it.
A:	So, another thing that we tried to do,
A:	I, I know your son's too young right now,
A:	but we're trying, we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and, stuff like that
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and,
B:	I think that's really important,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we've already started about,
B:	you know, I mean, how young can they start T-Ball and soccer?
A:	Right
B:	You know, I mean, I just,
B:	you know, we both think of that that as just so important,  to get him involved in stuff like that
A:	It is.
B:	and,  you could hardly wait,
A:	It is.
A:	And,
B:	I mean, he's, he's so much fun now,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he's really, he's really starting to get lots of fun
B:	and I can't wait until stuff like that starts happening
A:	I bet,
A:	yeah.
B:	you know, and, you know, we did the Easter egg hunts, which was really the first year he was really able to
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	understand.
B:	and to know what we know what he was doing you know, and enjoy it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it was so much fun
B:	and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant
B:	and, God  he got up on this elephant all by himself
A:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	You're kidding.
B:	and Lord, I couldn't believe it.
A:	You're kidding.
B:	They had so much fun.
A:	Oh, that's great.
B:	I bought us tickets and stood there in line
B:	and I thought, I'm going to end up on this elephant with him you know,
B:	He did it by himself,
A:	Well, good for him.
B:	so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really, getting fun,  you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him
B:	and he like comes home with something new everyday, you know
B:	and so,   I know, I know they're working with him
A:	Well, that's great.
A:	That's so good.
B:	and he's excited to get there in the morning, and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just like bye,
B:	and he goes running,  you know,
A:	He's out of there.
B:	and he's always having fun when I pick him up
B:	so, you know. Yeah,
B:	this, this day care is, is,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's Bright Steps in Lewisville.
B:	And,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	whenever you say Bright Steps, everybody goes, oh, I've heard that's the best day care in town, you know,
A:	Yeah?
A:	Good.
B:	and it's, it's one of those that's very hard to get into.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they have, this, this, this woman owns three day cares, two in Lewisville and one in Irving.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because, her waiting list was just like, you know, like a year old,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it was ridiculous.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	And, she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other.
A:	No kidding.
B:	Yes,
B:	so its,
A:	She knows something right, that she
A:	and,
B:	She knows what she's doing,
B:	all the teachers, like about half the teachers are degreed teachers.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that makes such a difference.
B:	Oh, it makes a huge difference.
A:	That's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that really makes a difference.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're in it because it's a profession,  not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else, you know .
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
B:	And, his old day care as much as I loved it, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the owner, I really liked her
B:	and she worked really hard to get good people,
B:	but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And, and I got lucky
B:	and all of his teachers were, very good.
A:	Because, because,
A:	Right.
A:	Some, sometimes that's fine,
A:	that's great, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but then sometimes, you know,
A:	Sometimes it isn't.
A:	You just have to.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, is it real expensive then?
B:	Um, it just went up the first of this month.
B:	I'm paying, uh, seventy nine dollars a week for now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Wow.
B:	It's a little high,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, but it's, you know, it's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three,
B:	so there's quite a little jump there,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	but, I looked all over Lewisville,
B:	I looked in every day care there was in Lewisville,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, and there were places that were cheaper,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but is it,
A:	No.
B:	you know, your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money,  you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I have peace of mind, where he is
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and some of those other places I wouldn't have.
A:	That's exactly it.
A:	See, we do the same thing,
A:	since Galen goes to nursery school, we pay our, our home care provider, for our day care provider, full time for a whole week,
A:	but she, she's gone three mornings.
A:	Galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, I said to her, I said, you know, it doesn't matter if for whatever
A:	when school holidays come around, I used to have such a problem with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They wouldn't have anything to do.
A:	I'd either have to
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, have you ever, uh, had a family reunion?
A:	Yes,
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, let me tell you
A:	this is a really neat thing to do too, that they did,
A:	I didn't do it.
A:	Some of the other people, the older people organized it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, what they did, they had, uh, a book made up
A:	and it was like, when our ancestors first came over.
B:	Oh.
B:	No kidding.
A:	And, then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family. And, like, how many kids you had, and who you had married,
B:	Huh.
A:	and, you know, it went through like,
A:	and it showed who my, uh, well, who my husband's parents were, you know. And, who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and it went through the whole family and stuff.
B:	Oh, that's so neat.
A:	And, it was so good.
B:	Oh, great
A:	Yeah.
A:	But it, it really did,
A:	you know, and plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because, you got to participate sort of.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up, about it,
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you could get it at the reunion.
A:	Right.
A:	And, everybody got a book,  that came to the reunion.
B:	Oh, nice.
A:	And, it told like, uh, you know, where the first Connallys came over,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had
A:	and it just kept coming on up through the generations.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, it was really, that was really neat.
B:	That is neat.
A:	And,
B:	So, do you have a big family?
A:	Well, he does
B:	Oh, he does?
B:	Yeah
A:	He does,
A:	I don't.
A:	But, uh, he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any
B:	That's kind of how my husband and I are.
B:	I have a kind of a big family
B:	and he just has himself and his brother and his parents,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's it.
B:	So, he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's what, that's what happened when I, when I first, uh, met my husband.
A:	I said, this can't be, you know,
A:	nobody can have this many relatives,
A:	because a lot of them lived in like a group, you know, down one highway.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, there was a lake,
A:	and they all lived down there by it.
B:	Oh, how nice.
A:	And, so, we were going down, the highway, you know,
A:	and he kept saying, this is where my uncle lives
A:	and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle,
B:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	and I kept thinking, this guy is putting me on.
A:	Nobody has this many relatives, you know
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, but, they really were all there.
B:	How funny.
A:	And, another thing that's really good about, uh, family reunions, is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty,  and bring it.  At, because nobody it seemed like, liked the same thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	But you had a choice
A:	and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too, and get a lot of good recipes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going to have fried fish, or, we're all going, to have fried chicken.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Everybody might not like that.
B:	Not be able to do it.
B:	So, did people come like from out of town to the reunion
B:	or,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
B:	They did.
A:	they came from all over.
B:	Did you put them up in other people's houses
B:	or did you have hotel rooms,
B:	or, how did you do it?
A:	Um, they just stayed with different ones of them.
B:	They did.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They just came down and like say, okay, this aunt and Uncle Kip, uh, all their kids and their grand kids and everything,
A:	and then, they had it.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	It had gotten so big that they had it at the church.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	And, they had a church service ahead of it,
A:	you know, and then they had, uh,  uh, then they ate out on the ground.
B:	How nice.
B:	And they just brought food with them?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did they just have like over a weekend?
B:	Is that how they did it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I'm real curious because my family,
B:	it didn't sound,
B:	I don't think my family is as big as your husband's.
B:	I don't think we'd need a whole church,
B:	but, um, the problem is we are all really scattered, around.
B:	There isn't any one place where most of us live,
B:	so if we ever had a reunion, we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel.
B:	I mean, you know, there would be one person who lived there that would have a house,
B:	but they couldn't put everybody up.
B:	So it, I think it would get kind of expensive.
A:	But, you know what you can do?
B:	Huh?
A:	A lot of these lakes and things, if you could find a centrally located, like, say about the same distance for all of you all to come?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They have these places where you can rent them
A:	and it, you know, like on a lake,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	like, uh, it's a big place,
A:	I mean, you know, it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, it's not very expensive that way.
B:	Oh, you mean
B:	so,
B:	oh, I see,
B:	so everybody could stay together?
A:	Right.
A:	It's like a, they have like a, a convention type thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	a house or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, then it has little rooms off of it where, you know, you'd go and sleep at night time.
B:	Oh!
A:	But, then it has like a kitchenette and things like that
A:	but you,
B:	See, that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together, than if you all were in your own hotels or something.
A:	Right.
A:	And another,
B:	And then, every time you wanted to go eat with somebody, you'd probably have to go to out, eat or something.
B:	It would run into a lot of money.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, they had,
A:	that was,
A:	you know, that,
B:	That sounds like fun.
A:	what you can do is, you can write different places, the Chamber of Commerce, tell them what you're interested in.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Ask them what they have, you know, at area lakes and all. If they have something like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	because now every time we plan anything, just about, we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because, you can find out so much easier, that way, than try to locate it, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You get a,
B:	Yeah.
A:	calling different places can really run you up a bill.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance,
A:	I mean, you can't get it exact, you know, usually,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but, uh, and then everybody goes to that place.
A:	And that is not bad at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, they have, lot of times they'll have like, uh, little cabins,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, they can all stay in those cabins.
A:	And then, you know, you can have cookouts and stuff like that
A:	that doesn't cost you as much.
B:	That would be great.
B:	That would be really nice
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, that's, uh, you know, that's the best way I found, because whenever you have,  something where you go and,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds good.
A:	now we had one,
A:	this was before I lost a lot more of my family,
A:	but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway. Because I didn't have any of them left.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um  they had, uh, uh, thing where you could, everybody could come and meet and go out to eat.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I didn't think that was as good. Because,  it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when, you were at the lake,  or somewhere, you know, where you were out.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.
B:	And you have to sit at a table and just,
B:	yeah,
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, it just,
A:	I didn't like that much.
B:	Well, um, did you,
B:	was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite.
B:	I mean, did you have to draw a line,
B:	or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line?
A:	No.
B:	Like, they just
B:	whoever wanted to come.
A:	What they did was, Well, see what they did was, okay, they, uh, they wrote to all the initial people, you know, the, the oldest ones.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Okay,
A:	then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they had like,
A:	I think there was four or five different people, that would call,  you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information, we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	And then, when they, when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter, it, uh, you know, to get the information and all, it asked, you know, will you be willing to bring
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, so, really there wasn't any problem with,
A:	that's the reason it ended up in a church because, I mean, there was just so many of them.
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, it turned out so much better like that. Because everybody knew, they knew ahead of time how many people to expect.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Now if there was a sickness or something like that, I mean, you know, you're not going to lose that many.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	No that would just be a few.
A:	Right.
B:	But how about like because of divorce and stuff like that?
B:	Like my parents are divorced,
A:	Okay well,
B:	and they are both remarried
B:	and, you know, there, I mean, there's,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, see, then
A:	okay,
A:	if you wanted them both to come, then you would put, you would have put that down on the list
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you would have sent, you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them, and ask for their information.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So then,
A:	To send back to those other people.
B:	I, I'm kind of like, in control over who comes. Uh, just from my family.
A:	Right.
A:	Because once it went to the, the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite,
B:	Yeah.
A:	then, they sent their little things to us.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	it was up to me, who I was going to, you know, whether I wanted my kids and, you know, my, any of my family to come.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	I see.
A:	So,
B:	I see,
B:	that's a pretty good idea to do it that way.
A:	And then, you know, it never did,
A:	like if I didn't want somebody to come, then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So there really wasn't a problem that way.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	right.
B:	Well, that's a real good idea.
A:	Well,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, I tell you what, that's the neatest book we've got,
B:	I bet.
A:	course we've got, we've still got it
A:	and they charged us, I think it was like, it was like five or six dollars, I can't remember  exactly, you know, that we paid for the book to be printed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's not, uh, it's not a hard back book, it's just a, oh, like a, you know, folder type thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it has the entire,
A:	you know, it has everybody that you could ever imagine, and some you couldn't
B:	How neat.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know, that's really neat.
B:	That's really neat.
A:	and, it will be something my kids will have, you know.
A:	Just like,
B:	I was just thinking of that. What you could tell your kids.
A:	yeah.
A:	Because if you stop and think,
A:	I don't know if you're like me,
A:	but I know very little about before my grandparents.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, very, very little about it.
B:	I just,
B:	the thing is I know a lot of stories,
B:	but I can't remember who it was about.
B:	My grandparents told us when I was growing up and even when I was an adult
B:	they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends, cause they all grew up in New York City,
B:	but I can't, you know, I remember these stories
B:	but I have no idea who it was that was in those stories.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I mean, I couldn't give an accurate,
B:	I couldn't tell my kids what, you know, those people were like,
B:	I just remember they had some funny stories,
B:	but I don't know who it was.
A:	Maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion, and you wanted to go back some,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents, then you can find out from, you know, you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these,
B:	Yeah
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
B:	What, uh, what kind of camping is there in Texas?
A:	Well, there, there are quite a few, um, parks, I guess, state parks,
A:	and there's a couple of national parks, I guess, that you can camp at.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, most of them have pretty good facilities.
A:	I don't know if the camping that I've done is really roughing it without a, a whole lot of stuff.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, you do, uh, like backpacking and the like?
A:	Uh, done a little bit of that, mainly just, um, like camping out at the state parks,
A:	I've been to a couple in Texas
A:	and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around.
B:	Huh.
B:	Is the Ozarks in Arkansas?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	part of them are.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, that's probably a pretty nice place to go
A:	Yeah,
A:	they've got, uh, real nice lake system, and, around their parks.
A:	One of them, uh, the gray , I think that's one of the ones we've been to, it's real nice there, a bunch of lakes around it,
A:	there's a golf course and, um, just a whole bunch of camping sites.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What about you,
A:	where have you, uh,
B:	Oh, I've been camping for years, not on a regular basis
B:	but, uh, I first started camping out in the desert in California. And then sometimes in the mountains also in California
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, then I moved to North Carolina
B:	and I, I didn't camp for a long time,
B:	and then I started to, uh, go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting,
B:	so, I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then maybe camp another night and drive home.
B:	And that was, uh, that was pretty good
B:	so, I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
B:	and, uh, you know, I still do it once in a while.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think we've collected stuff off and on over the years.
A:	The more times we did it, the more serious we get about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where, where is Raleigh, in North Carolina?
B:	Uh, well, it's, it's, uh, in terms of north, south I would say it's, uh, a little, a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it.
A:	Okay.
B:	So what
A:	Are you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains,
B:	Well, it, it's, uh,
A:	an area.
B:	actually the, the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh.
B:	They're about three hours away if you go due north.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, of
B:	the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer
B:	and you can pick those up going west,
B:	but then you're talking about six to eight hours.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The way it works.
B:	But, um, it's a real, it's a real nice place to go and camp,
B:	and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although , I don't think Raleigh, I don't think the state of North Carolina takes,
B:	they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my wife's from the western part of Virginia,
A:	we've been down the parkway a lot,
A:	but I didn't know how much, how much camping areas there were along there.
B:	I think there's quite a few.
B:	I can't say I've checked them all out though.
A:	What, what's it like camping in the desert and California,
A:	that seems, like a challenge.
B:	It's, uh, it's actually kind of incredible,
B:	it's really, really nice.
B:	Um, I like it better than almost anything I've ever done.
B:	Just the sky is so amazing.
B:	You know, you really can probably count thousands of stars,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's, it's just kind of nice.
B:	I like the, uh,
B:	I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize,
B:	you know, they hear desert
B:	and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,
B:	course it, it has all of those qualities
B:	but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's pretty nice.
B:	The, uh, the movie, THE DOORS, has some nice desert scenes,
B:	those guys all go camping out in the desert.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them
B:	but, um, the, uh, the shots are, are pretty nice
B:	and it's sort of like that,
B:	I mean, it's just almost surreal, in some places.
A:	Huh.
B:	It's very pleasant.
A:	Are the temperatures real extreme there
A:	or the, the,
B:	They can be,
B:	yeah.
B:	I mean, you got to, you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've been camping in Death Valley,
B:	one doesn't go in July
A:	Yeah,
A:	true.
B:	But it's beautiful in February.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, it's just beautiful.
B:	The days, get up into the high eighties, uh, maybe the nineties
B:	but it's, it's quite bearable
B:	and then the nights are reasonably warm, you know, sixties or seventies.
B:	It's just great.
B:	It's really very nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've talked about planning a trip up through, um,
A:	I have a sister-in-law that lives in New Mexico, up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area.
A:	I don't know, don't know when I'm going to get a chance to do that
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that would be, that would be pretty nice.
B:	I've been, I have been camping on the south rim the Grand Canyon.
B:	That's okay.
B:	A lot of people like to go down and camp down inside,
B:	I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking, especially with my gear.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll bet .
A:	That one, one thing you said about the stars is really true
A:	it's,
A:	when you're close to a big city like Dallas, the, the lights kind of wash, wash off the star
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so it's nice to, to get away.
A:	It's just amazing, how, how much you miss.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it,
B:	yeah,
B:	it really is.
B:	I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,
B:	you hear people talk about the Little Dipper.
A:	Huh Uh-huh.
B:	But I don't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in, in the mountains.
B:	Otherwise it's just too faint
A:	Well, I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think we fulfilled our obligation.
B:	Well, thanks for calling,
B:	nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was good talking to you Robert .
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, Stephanie, what's your position on gun control?
B:	Well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, I probably would lean more towards six or seven.
B:	Um, I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I lived in Massachusetts for two years
B:	and they have a total ban on guns
B:	and I saw that, it didn't stop crime in that state.
A:	Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles?
B:	Any, any kind of firearms.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it's,
B:	there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught, um, with a firearm
B:	and also I think there was a fine.
A:	And that didn't help at all?
B:	No,
B:	I don't,
B:	the, the crime is not any better or any worse,
B:	I mean it's,
A:	Huh.
B:	I, I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse,
B:	but it certainly didn't get any better.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I usually just,
A:	I'm trying to think of,
A:	I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the, the, like three, where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns any, by any means,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, uh,
A:	you know, you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and, you know, right off the shelf.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I agree with that.
A:	And but,
B:	I, I think that the, the law is on who can buy a gun are, are way too lax.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	exactly.
B:	I think that, I think that the,
A:	And, so, I think that kind of control is, would be good,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but the, uh,
A:	I, you know, I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and, just to kind of exam it a little bit
A:	and I, I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, uh,
A:	only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,
A:	but how many times,
A:	I guess I have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun.
B:	Um, I,
A:	And maybe they just don't report those
A:	or I'm not sure
A:	or, you know, I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed
A:	but good thing they had their gun on them
A:	and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I'm, I'm not really sure,
B:	I don't, personally I don't own a gun,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, and I don't think I probably ever would, um, although I would like to know how to handle one,
B:	and I think it's good that and I think everybody should learn how to handle one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one.
A:	True.
B:	Um,
A:	Did, did you, were you brought up in a family that hunted
A:	or,
B:	No.
B:	Uh, nobody in my family hunted,
B:	uh, my father had, had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts
B:	We lived in New Hampshire at the time.
A:	How about that.
B:	And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns,
A:	Huh.
B:	so we ended up, uh, with these guns,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my, really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
B:	and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere.
A:	Oh, jeez.
B:	And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns
B:	and it, it kind of scared me.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I think that if I learn how to use one, I would, I would feel better.
A:	Right.
A:	I've also always thought about the idea, you know, most sports, you know, which are the N R A and people have their thing, you know,
A:	if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.
A:	Most of that's done with rifles and such. Uh, though there's, you know, probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns.
A:	But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,
A:	you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately, you know,
A:	if they had to have a rifle or was,
A:	you know, made it more difficult to get a, a, uh, a handgun.
A:	Now of course, you know, in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,
A:	I don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not
A:	but I guess it would be some.
A:	But I, I think definitely,
A:	like today they just introduced the, what's called the Brady bill. The seven day mandatory waiting period, on getting any guns.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that,  Shoot that's a good idea.
B:	I would definitely support that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, I agree the thing that scares me, uh, though about where I would, I would definitely want some sort of legislation
B:	and coming from the north east, I'm just not used to seeing, um, these,
B:	and I, I know this may sound kind of stereo typical
B:	but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks. That's kind of scary to me
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism .
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on, in L A, on the freeways,
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's crazy .
B:	and then you come here in, in the Dallas area, um,
B:	I don't, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles. Um, especially not in the back window, for everybody to see.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's kind of, kind of wild.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That is kind of wild.
A:	Well, that's all very interesting
A:	Well, thanks for talking.
B:	Sure you're welcome.
A:	Good-bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
B:	There we go.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, actually I'm a, I'm a Dodgers fan from way back.
A:	Oh
B:	Um,
A:	how way back, I mean
B:	Like, um, late fifties, early sixties.
A:	Okay
A:	so Wally Moon moon shots and all that.
B:	What's that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	coliseum, Wally Moon and all that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's a, um,
A:	I, I'm living in, just west of Baltimore, and Frederick, um, which is also just west of Baltimore, has a minor league team.
A:	And, uh, and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	so he's still kicking around.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to, uh, going away to college,
B:	and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens.
A:	Oh, I saw them,
A:	um, um, I was out there last Summer,
A:	and I saw a game at Ned Skelton.
A:	Is that the stadium?
B:	Uh, I couldn't tell you for sure.
B:	It's been a long time.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, um, there used to be a, uh, race track.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was,
A:	that was impression I got when I was there
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's right.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	so had a lot of fun
A:	actually, I mean, I like minor league baseball, a lot.
A:	It's cheaper for one thing
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here.
B:	Uh, they've led the American league in batting, fielding and pitching,
B:	but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any, any given year.
B:	So.
A:	Yes
A:	I think they're in for a odd year this year,
A:	actually, um, they, um,
A:	I don't understand why Encovilla got released.
B:	I don't either.
B:	I mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some R B I-s.
A:	I mean, he, you know, he can't field
A:	and, you know, he strikes out a lot,
A:	but, I mean, he's done that for five years.
A:	Why get rid of him now?
B:	Really, I mean, he really has become a, a very decent fielder.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Okay.
B:	He's not a, the liability that he was, that he used to be.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Um.
A:	Oh, he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, I mean with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, you know,
B:	if he strikes out a lot, so what.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I mean, with Detroit, I mean, they can get away with one guy like that.
A:	I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know, which they did.
B:	Right.
B:	Yep.
A:	So.
B:	Well, I think the key for, for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back.
A:	I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter.
B:	It may be.
A:	I, I like them a lot.
A:	I think they're going to go all the way.
A:	Um, and, and, I mean, by saying I like them, I like their chances.
A:	I, I actually don't like the Dodgers,
A:	I'm a Giants fan from way back.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Well, picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt.
A:	No,
A:	but Butler didn't hurt either.
A:	Uh, and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt
A:	and,
B:	Uh, who's the last one.
A:	Bobby Ojeda.
A:	They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Um, he's a, a pretty decent pitcher.
A:	He's,
B:	Yes he is.
A:	Okay,
A:	you know, he .
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, that guy , the short stop, is going to be good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Well it should be an interesting year.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm looking,
A:	I've already been to one game,
A:	and I should have been to two
A:	but,
B:	Are you an Orioles fan?
A:	Um, the, the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox, mostly die,
A:	but, um, I go to the Orioles since they're here,
A:	and I, you know, I do enjoy them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I've had an opening day on Monday.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you know, I kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while.
A:	How far is Houston?
B:	Uh, three hundred miles.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is, it's incredible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, um,
A:	you know, we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia.
B:	There you go.
A:	And, um, saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before.
B:	Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, yeah
B:	Interesting.
A:	Um, I try to see whatever I can.
A:	I mean, I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years.
B:	Wow.
A:	Yeah,
A:	hope I'm going to do it this year because, um, uh, having a kid this fall,
A:	so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games.
B:	All right.
B:	So, so do it while you can.
A:	Yeah,
A:	seriously.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, it's been good talking with you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	good talking with you.
A:	And, and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win.
B:	I wouldn't mind it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, God bless
B:	and good talking with you.
A:	And good talking with you.
A:	Take care.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	Do you want to start?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm trying to think what I've seen lately.
A:	I
A:	well we just finished watching, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, you know
B:	Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES,
B:	did you see the movie?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we've seen that,
A:	yeah.
B:	Did you like it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was great,
A:	have you seen it?
B:	I thought it was very well done.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, um,
B:	How about GHOST?
A:	We, we saw, an, we liked it
A:	but, you know, I didn't think it was as good as all the, uh, hype was about it.
B:	Right,
B:	I feel the same way about that too.
B:	It was okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I
A:	I, I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, uh, best picture.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	And, uh,
B:	let's see, uh,
B:	the most recent ones that I've seen are those two, GHOST and, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES,
B:	but I rent, uh, uh, videos,
B:	do you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and so we just,
B:	You, you watch many?
A:	Uh, it depends, um, you know, it depends on
B:	Do you like the classics like, uh, GONE WITH THE WIND and, uh, you know the older movies.
A:	I'd like to see those,
A:	I keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three movies that I, I keep telling myself that I should see one of these, you know, some day that I haven't seen, you know, that, that are classics, you know.
A:	Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was good.
A:	and never seen, I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND.
B:	I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, in, you know a long time ago,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, like the MALTESE FALCON and all those, uh, uh,
A:	Oh, I, I
A:	we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on, on T V a couple of years ago,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was good,
B:	yeah.
A:	and I've, I've I've been wanting to see all of it
A:	but we just, you know, we walk into the video store
A:	and we're like well why don't we go see this now
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's true.
A:	But, um, I
A:	one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, uh, MISERY.
B:	Oh, I didn't see that one.
A:	That was good, um,
B:	Really.
A:	oh, it was great.
A:	And it,
A:	you think, you know, for a Stephen, you know, it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory
A:	but there's only one,
A:	well there's a couple scenes, at, at the end there's, there is, you know some blood and everything
A:	and there's one really bad scene where it's, I mean, there's not blood but it's pretty graphic
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it's, um, it's a really good movie, um.
B:	Really,
B:	is that the one where, uh, the guy gets captured by that women?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
A:	he's a writer
A:	and, um, she's his biggest fan
A:	and she's also  a little, a little on the nutso side.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS?
A:	No,
A:	we haven't, um,
B:	I saw that one,
B:	that one wasn't that great either.
A:	Oh, it wasn't?
B:	Well I didn't think so,
B:	no.
A:	I, I got,
A:	I heard like mixed reviews, um, of that,
A:	we
B:	How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
A:	That's, that's on our list of things to see
B:	I know,
B:	I, I wanted to see,
B:	I, I was curious if you had seen it
B:	and that, uh,
A:	our big thing is, um,
A:	you know, movie prices up here
A:	I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know. So it's like,
A:	you know, a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees
A:	and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape.
B:	That's us too,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	true.
B:	I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.
A:	well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	have you seen that?
B:	No.
A:	Oh, it was great
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah
A:	it was,
B:	I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	it's, um, it's an odd film
A:	and it's really interesting that,
A:	I like the director a lot, um, a guy named Tim Burton.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE?
B:	Uh, part of it,
B:	I,  I never really watched the whole thing.
A:	Oh,
A:	Oh,
A:	yeah,
A:	well if you, if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS,
A:	if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, um,
A:	Burton's kind of, uh,
A:	he's, a very odd, odd man
A:	but he's,
A:	I think he's very interesting
A:	and, uh, I liked those two movies of his a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He did BATMAN also, which, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was pretty good, though, really.
A:	It was good,
A:	but I mean, he was, um,
B:	When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour
B:	and it really,
B:	there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars,  and all the different stuff like that, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah, oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Whose your favorite actress or actor?
A:	Um, don't really know,
A:	I like Costner a lot
A:	but, uh,  I'm a big, I'm a big baseball fan
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, you know, after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, although, you know,
B:	That was good,
B:	I saw that movie too.
B:	That was very good.
A:	Which one?
B:	FIELD OF DREAMS.
A:	Yeah,
A:	FIELD OF DREAMS was good,
A:	um, and, I, I think, I liked the other movies he's done.
A:	NO WAY OUT was really good
A:	and,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	did you ever see SILVERADO?
B:	SILVERADO,
B:	uh, who, who was that with?
A:	Um, let's see.
A:	Danny Glover, Scott Glen, Kevin Kline, um, Brian Dennehy , Jeff Goldblum's in.
A:	Uh, John Kreas is in it if you don't blink.
B:	That,
B:	the
B:	the, the title sounds familiar,
B:	I'm trying to
A:	It was, it was a big western,
A:	I mean, I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.
A:	Uh, it was,
A:	and I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours,
A:	and, and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Um, but it was, it was really good Um,
B:	I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I I would remember, I think in, with him in it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about REVENGE,
B:	did you see that with him?
A:	No,
A:	I didn't,
A:	is that any good?
B:	With, uh, Anthony Quinn.
B:	I thought it was,
B:	I like everything he's done so far.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	You know, it's, uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie
B:	but it was okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we were in the video store today
A:	and somebody was recommending it to somebody.
A:	You know the, the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else.
B:	Yeah
B:	it was, it was not a bad movie.
A:	Huh, well, I'll have to catch it one of these days.
A:	You
A:	you, you said you seen NO WAY OUT?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was excellent.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was very good.
A:	Um, he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too.
B:	Now that's another one I wanted to see.
B:	in fact, that was advertised not too long ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was on, um,
B:	Cable?
A:	no,
A:	it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend.  Uh, or two weeks ago.
B:	Okay,
B:	I know I saw, yeah, something about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, um, I wish, I, I mean I'd seen it when, when, you know, it was originally in the theaters
A:	and, um, I saw it, you know, I saw part of it again.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean I like, you know, I like Costner,
A:	I like Sean Connery,
A:	and, uh, there's this one, there's this one actor,
A:	it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot
A:	but I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith.
B:	I don't know him.
A:	Um, you've probably seen him
A:	and just, an,
A:	you know, oh, that's who the guy is.
A:	Do you remember,
A:	did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI?
B:	No,
B:	I, I don't think so.
A:	Oh.
A:	Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN.
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay,
A:	in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, um, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen, or Nancy Allen.
B:	Okay,
B:	okay.
A:	You know,
A:	short nerdy guy with glasses.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	He's, he's just,
A:	I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in.
A:	He was in the UNTOUCHABLES.
A:	He was the accountant
B:	Oh, oh I know who you mean.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He was in, uh, uh, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	you're thinking of Rick Moranis.
A:	He looks like Rick Moranis
A:	but he's not
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	all right,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's the one I was thinking of.
B:	But I have, I've seen quite a few movies,
B:	I, I enjoy them.
B:	I think that, uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment. An, uh, an escape type of thing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	How about some of the ads,
B:	do you go by the ads when you look at them, or the reviews?
B:	Do they influence you a lot.
A:	Uh, a little of,
A:	a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Did you see GOODFELLAS?
A:	No,
A:	it's uh,
A:	I want to see it.
B:	That that was pretty good.
B:	Um, and,
A:	Um, we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also
A:	but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the GODFATHER movies
A:	so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.
B:	I was just going to say, you should see those, uh, first if you can.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If if you read the book it's, uh, even better.
B:	The book was excellent.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I haven't,  never read it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, I was a little disappointed in the third
B:	it's GODFATHER THREE.
B:	It was not bad
B:	but, I expected more, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN,
A:	with, um,
A:	it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, um, uh, Marlon Brando.
A:	And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately.
A:	Um, but, uh,  there's a bunch of scenes from, uh, uh, from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school.
A:	And, uh, in his classes they're using, there's a they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER
A:	and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know, this you know this, uh, organized crime head.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie.
A:	Uh.
B:	or, uh,
A:	I liked RAINMAN,
A:	I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that was good,
B:	I liked RAINMAN, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I'm,
A:	being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um,
A:	Barry Levinson did, um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they sound familiar.
B:	I probably saw parts of those.
B:	You know, a lot of times I'll I'll start watching a movie
B:	and I'm tired
B:	and it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	next thing you know, it's, it's
B:	especially if there's commercial in it
B:	and then the titles might sound familiar
B:	but I really don't know what they're all about.
A:	of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.
A:	I mean, they're, they're all pretty good,
A:	but DINER is really worth seeing.
B:	Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
A:	Uh, late fifties,
A:	yeah.
B:	Late fifties,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think I saw that one.
A:	Okay
A:	and, uh,
B:	How about Meryl Streep,
A:	Uh, I don't know,
A:	I'm not a real, uh, great football follower,
A:	I guess, there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year.
A:	One is the Dallas Cowboys
A:	and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, being a native Okie, I uh, I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing. Uh.
B:	I see,
B:	so you make it, uh, to that Longhorns Sooners game?
A:	No.
B:	Every year.
A:	No,
A:	it's funny.
A:	Uh, I got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh, seventy-three and, uh, never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since.
B:	How about that.
A:	But I always enjoyed watching them,
A:	I just
A:	growing up in Oklahoma, there it was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And there's always been an interest there.
B:	Well, it's kind of same for me,
B:	I grew up in southern New Jersey
B:	and the local team was Philadelphia.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they were like thirty miles right up the river
B:	and I'm still pretty much an Eagle fan, I guess.
A:	I guess you keep those things you grew up with.
A:	I worked in, uh, Missouri for a while
A:	and, uh, I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals
A:	and I was rooting for the Cowboys.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, they were kind of closer to home when, when I struck up with them.
A:	I really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year.
A:	Everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year.
A:	In a way that happened this past season,
A:	and I think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.
A:	I look for it to be a pretty good year.
B:	Boy they, uh, they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.
A:	They did,
A:	uh, they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't, weren't familiar with.
A:	Some of them turned out to be pretty good players,
A:	uh, some of them didn't
A:	and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off.
A:	At least we hope it will.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm, I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump.
B:	They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years
B:	but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there
B:	And you know, they've got a lot of the tools to do it,
B:	but doggone if they can't just put it together, uh, you know,
B:	they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham, who's just, you know, phenomenal,
B:	but, he, he's too streaky it seems.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but they have always been a really strong team.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	and without a whole lot of big name players.
B:	They have got a few anchors on offense and defense
B:	and you know they, they've managed with those guys
B:	and I don't know.
A:	Once the pressure gets turned on they, they seem to loose it.
B:	I guess, yeah.
A:	See that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys. And the Oklahoma Sooners.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's funny, over the years.
B:	I guess since Staubach left, they haven't been able to,  keep it going.
A:	It's.  It's been a rough tow, a rough road to hoe ever since he left.
A:	I don't know why it's so hard to find, uh, a good quarterback these days.
B:	Well, that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though I think. For Staubach's, I mean.
A:	Well, yeah.
A:	You know, he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform,
A:	uh, we hope,
A:	every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through.
A:	In a way Aikman has done some of that.
A:	But, uh, the guy winds up getting hurt every other game.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I tell you, it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there, he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they did.
A:	They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside.
A:	Uh, it's funny watching them, them play,
A:	he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,
A:	when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I haven't quite figured that out,
A:	if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I don't know
A:	I'm looking for a good year.
A:	I guess we're always looking for a good year.
B:	So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year
B:	or who do you, who do you like to do that this year?
A:	Uh, no
A:	I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.
A:	I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,
A:	and they'll get close to it.
A:	They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.
B:	So who's going to beat them?
B:	Who are they going to blow it to?
A:	Uh, that's a good question.
A:	Uh, I'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco
A:	I'm not real sure.
B:	Boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.
A:	They did.
A:	So, I don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team, sometimes it brings in new motivation
A:	and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm sure, you know, my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia,
B:	but I, I sure am scared of them Giants
A:	Well, that's true.
B:	Those guys are tough.
A:	They are tough
A:	and they're big,
A:	they're mean
A:	and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That, that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean, I wasn't pulling for either team.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	But that was just a good football game.
A:	And it's funny,
A:	you know. You like to pull for the underdog
A:	and for a long time I was pulling for Denver.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does,
A:	but he's a good quarterback.
A:	He's got a good arm,
A:	sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard.
B:	L A you mean?
A:	I mean L A,
A:	sorry.
B:	Boy, speaking of Denver, on another subject, I've been up there like five times in the last three, four weeks.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah
B:	we've been trying get this new D N B two thousand printer up and running.
A:	Has it been, uh, snowing up there?
B:	Oh, boy I was just up there,
B:	I just got back last night around eleven thirty or so,
B:	and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground.
A:	Wow.
B:	And it snowed all day.
A:	Well, that will make the skiers happy.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	If, if
B:	it snowed that much in Denver you know
B:	they got that much up in the mountains, you know, just west of there.
A:	Oh, you bet.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain, those guys will love that.
A:	Well, good to talk to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	enjoyed it Bob.
A:	You guys have a good time, keep those printers coming.
B:	Hey,
B:	we'll do it.
A:	All right,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	Okay,
B:	do I still still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world?
B:	Absolutely.
B:	And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers, what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.
A:	Um. Okay.
A:	I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,
A:	but I think just the instability of the country right now is, sort of scary.
B:	Well, that's what makes it a powder keg.
B:	The, um,
B:	I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,  when my first real involvement with the military started.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, naturally we were at the time,
B:	the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.
B:	So we got lots, quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. And with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.
B:	These weren't, these weren't Chinese made copies.
B:	These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty-sevens. As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	In Granada, in October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.
B:	Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,
B:	but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.
B:	The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on Point Salinas.
B:	And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.
A:	Huh.
B:	And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.
B:	In eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.
B:	Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.
B:	And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.
B:	Do I consider them a threat?
B:	Absolutely.
B:	They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.
B:	About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.
B:	Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.
B:	And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.
A:	Huh.
B:	I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.
B:	These guys are top of the line.
B:	When they, when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.
B:	And they are very, very good at what they do.
B:	So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet military, of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.
B:	That
B:	irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.
B:	Well, it's interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.
B:	So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
B:	There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.
B:	If uprisings happen in their sectors, it is, it's going to be a total blood bath.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it looks like it's come close to that as it is.
B:	Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.
B:	They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out
B:	and they, would level entire areas.
B:	Okay,
B:	you're from the Dallas area, right?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around Richardson?
A:	Yeah.
B:	You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area
B:	and there won't be anything left alive.
B:	And they can do that in about four minutes.
A:	Huh.
B:	And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.
B:	They used them in Afghanistan, did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.
B:	But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.
B:	If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.
B:	The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.
B:	They drink that much fuel.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Were you,
B:	have you,
B:	I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't.
B:	As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,
B:	I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?
B:	Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?
A:	You mean in the, in the most recent conflict?
B:	In any of them since eighty-one.
A:	Oh. Yeah,
A:	definitely.
A:	I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.
A:	It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.
B:	It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,
B:	it's a matter of money,  to a certain extent.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.
B:	Uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.
B:	They're not really that worried about invading north.
B:	They're more interested in,
B:	they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that. From Mexico all the way down into Central and South America.
B:	The situation down there is weird
B:	and it's very screwed up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Inflation is out of this world
B:	and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.
B:	And generally the people,  are getting screwed,
B:	and they're tired of it,
B:	and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about to do something to get out of communism.
A:	I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.
A:	I think Gorbachev has about had his day.
B:	Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.
B:	That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Gorbachev has made his attempt
B:	and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.
B:	So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,  at this point.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	True
A:	I don't know,
A:	I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.
B:	You mean,
B:	I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,
B:	I thought that was great.
B:	But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.
B:	But you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down. Even if it's a regional conflict.
B:	If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does it, it can talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.
B:	It's got to have the stuff to back it, back up what it's saying.
B:	If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground.
A:	At least they're learning a little bit from history.
A:	I mean, uh,
A:	So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,
A:	so.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, well, what do you think is, uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air?
B:	I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just, uh, I think they put off so much
B:	and they're not regulated enough.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well , that's me too.
A:	After, um,
A:	on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,
A:	and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,
A:	but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution
A:	and, you know, their their regulation that's placed on them is, I mean, it's better than it used to be
A:	but it's incredible that they still don't have, you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, I, I just,
A:	I can't stand that
A:	and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,
A:	you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a, we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a plant, uh, a Pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I know people that work there that,
A:	of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,
B:	No.
A:	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do, uh, to, uh, make their dough and to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,
B:	Really?
A:	yeah,
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, it's incredible.
A:	And, um, they said that they're, you know, they have a little creek that runs by them
A:	and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything
A:	and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping,
B:	Oh.
A:	and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,
B:	Right.
A:	that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant
A:	I can't imagine plants,
B:	I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even had you know, well,
B:	those chemicals would not,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to, to break the flours down
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then they, they also do testing there,
A:	and I don't,
A:	you know, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive
A:	but toxic can be, can be anything that's uh, classified that can damage the Earth.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, uh, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.
B:	Right,
B:	you know, like in, In packaging
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, you know, just goodness.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they do, they do a lot of research
A:	and they do, um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there
A:	or,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm not really,
A:	what's it called when you do flour,
A:	I'm not,
B:	Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching
B:	but, I mean, I, I don't know what's, how they do the flour.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, we, we're on the southwest side of Houston
B:	we don't have that much as far as, uh, aiming in the plants over on this, uh, the east side does.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We've got Imperial sugar
B:	but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also
B:	and, uh, they've been there for years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	But,
A:	I mean, you think about it, it, you know,
A:	it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just,
A:	I'm not really sure
A:	but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,
B:	Yeah.
A:	or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but when they pollute into the air and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.
A:	So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the
A:	unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends to get stuck there,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air, you know, per, per, uh, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away,
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um,
B:	I know that,
B:	I worry every now and then,
B:	we're still on a well water,
B:	we're not on city water,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I know out in some,
A:	I'm not sure,
A:	I can't remember the name of the county
A:	it's, it's where Stillwater is or, sweet,
B:	Yeah.
A:	no
A:	I'm not sure,
A:	I know it,
A:	I think it's, uh,
A:	I know we have a piece property there,
A:	it's called Dublin,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's in Dublin, Texas.
A:	I'm not really sure what the county,
A:	it's Stephen,
A:	no
A:	Stephenville.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, um, introduced a lot of dairies there,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, they have a lot of cattle in the area,
A:	I mean, they've got like per, per, uh, per lot,
A:	you know, they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't
A:	it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they've got to have them there to be able to milk them.
A:	And they,
A:	and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow produces, like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.
B:	Oh.
A:	One cow,
A:	I was like, my God,
A:	and they,
A:	and this thing says that, that, you know, people think, well, cow manure is good for fertilizer
A:	but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not, it's not
A:	when, you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it
A:	and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and this, and this article said that they've got a real problem that, um, you've got toxins and, and, uh, bacteria in the manure that is,
A:	what it's doing is it's going through, uh,
A:	they don't have a very deep, um,
A:	you know, their water, their natural water, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I forget what that's called with, you know,
A:	it's like a spring, spring water,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it's below the surface
A:	it's not very far down,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,
B:	Oh.
A:	and they're like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, their they're water in that town will be totally polluted,
B:	It will.
A:	and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	and the
A:	and I'm like my God, you know, just from that one, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.
A:	No,
A:	not when you figure,
A:	I didn't realize a cow, one cow produces that much manure
A:	and they were talking like, thousands of cows, you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.
B:	These are well fed .
B:	These are,
A:	You,
B:	Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh,
A:	Well, they are evidently.
A:	But, um, I mean, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,
B:	Right.
A:	but when they get them in these tiny little areas, you know, and they've got a real big problem,
A:	and they, they said that, that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, uh, these like ponds that they had to filter it with,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they overflow into the, the creeks and stuff in the area.
A:	So, that just creates,
A:	you know, there, there's,
A:	and, oh, it was just disgusting
A:	it said the creeks will foam.
B:	Oh.
A:	People, people stand outside their houses and their, watch the creeks foam brown and all,
B:	Oh, now that's bad.
A:	and I'm just like, oh, my gosh,
A:	and the smell is really bad they
B:	Oh, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I, I don't know
A:	it really frightens me though as far as the, when you think about the, you know, thinking of just air pollution itself
A:	and then, and, channel thirteen they're really, um, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	if we, if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for, um, just the, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	And then cutting the trees, you know, that bothers me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	As far as, you know the
A:	The rain forest and all.
B:	yes,
B:	uh, we've been wanting to,
B:	well, not me
B:	but, uh, it's been or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here,
B:	I'm like, no,
B:	you know, for what's cut down here, you know, more will be cut down someplace else
B:	and it will just take that longer to grow back,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and trees help so that, uh,
B:	I don't,
A:	Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're synthesizing it for us.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	believe me it's just so much better.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, yeah,
B:	I knew,
B:	I think there's lots that be, that could be done to, to improve how things are done now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think we just have to,
A:	I don't know personally, you know,
A:	I suppose, you know, if you just make sure your car is, is working properly
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and
A:	you know, they're
A:	nowadays they have the emission controls on them
A:	but, uh, I think the only, the main thing is just keep on the, your legislator's back, you know, as far as,
A:	seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it, it's really becoming a problem.
A:	By the year two thousand there will,
A:	what, what are we going to have,
A:	what kind of results are we going to have for the environment.
B:	Right.
A:	And, and what will we ...
A:	Huh?
A:	Okay.
B:	I don't know how much I know about this subject
A:	Well, I don't know if I know anything or not,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I've, I've got some opinions on it.
B:	Okay.
B:	Go ahead.
A:	See those type of people that, that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything
B:	Yeah
A:	Well, uh, I've had teenagers
A:	and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers,
A:	and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.
A:	Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far.
A:	And the young people are overly impressed.
A:	And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.
B:	That's true.
A:	Uh, I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.
B:	Um, me either.
B:	I, I went to college and then started working and then got married
B:	and,
A:	But they have,
A:	I read somewhere,
A:	and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college
A:	and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States.
A:	Have you ever heard about that one?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't,
B:	I know that, uh, my sister,
B:	I have a twin sister
B:	and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas
B:	and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	If it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live.
A:	And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
B:	Yeah,
B:	she only taught there one year
B:	but I,
A:	But she got credits for it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's very interesting.
B:	And, um, I think it would be,
B:	I know that also one of my cousins who, uh, he is in like the therapy type thing
B:	and he was, um,
B:	some group paid part of his college income
B:	but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh,
B:	I mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, you know, if,
B:	I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that is an excellent program,
A:	I really do.
A:	I like that.
A:	And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.
B:	Yeah.
B:	As far as yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff, yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but we could find one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I, I can see the advantage to that one.
A:	The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?
B:	I really don't know that much about it,
B:	you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when,
A:	It's still in existence.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And don't they go into other countries and stuff?
A:	I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, uh, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Things that make the,
B:	yeah.
B:	Make them more self-supporting?
A:	Yes.
A:	They,
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, yes,
A:	you're right,
A:	I think it's a sixties program.
A:	I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he,
A:	that was his big deal.
B:	But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren
A:	and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But there's a,
B:	I don't, I don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,
A:	Mandatory just like, like the draft.
A:	No.
B:	I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,
A:	Every time you,
A:	They could buy their way out.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
A:	Right,
A:	you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.
A:	But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here,
A:	and maybe this is why this has died out.
A:	Can you go into,
A:	and this wasn't the question
A:	but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults,
A:	can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of
A:	the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time,
A:	but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation
A:	and teach them to farm and teach them
A:	and it doesn't do any good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know that it does.
A:	I, I, don't know that, um, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, we're losing certain, races of people.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out.
A:	There's a German word for it that's elegant,
A:	but I never can remember what it was,
A:	uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh, when we were in Australia, uh,
A:	sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore,
A:	and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else
A:	and that's sad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people,
A:	and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is, really an effective tool.
B:	Well,
B:	Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.
A:	Good point.
A:	We've got enough without without a passport
A:	there's plenty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	I think we ought to worry about our own species.
B:	And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.
A:	I wonder now in,
A:	and I've been out of school too long to answer this,
A:	but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
B:	There probably are, you know,
B:	for
B:	but I'm sure,
B:	that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff
B:	but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know,
B:	and
B:	I'm not saying just give them money
B:	but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be,
A:	That's the last thing you want, to do.
B:	Yeah
B:	I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money
B:	or, what was it
B:	they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people,
B:	I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's exactly it.
B:	but.
A:	They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it.
A:	Now come on, let's be realistic,
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's just not realistic.
B:	Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here,
B:	but.
A:	No,
A:	we're not I don't think.
A:	I think, that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean it's,
B:	True.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's a lot more realistic.
A:	Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time
A:	and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, we've got plenty,
A:	in fact, we've got far too many.
A:	You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?
B:	Flower Mound,
B:	yeah.
B:	So, we're a little you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.
A:	I was,
A:	that's exactly what I was going to ask you.
A:	Have you ever, have, have you been downtown
A:	Start.
B:	What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?
A:	Um,
A:	well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,
A:	and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatever other combination there is.
A:	And, and I think they've got a uh, some kind of container for aluminum.
B:	Plano's doing real good on that.
B:	They have, uh, they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans. Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and of course it doesn't fit right now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But now we start in May, breaking it down,
B:	and they're picking it all up.
A:	Um.
B:	So they're going to by,
B:	and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,
B:	and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up from your yard,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we put that in disposable bags,
B:	and they pick that up on Monday.
A:	Um.
B:	So it's really great.
B:	I, I'm really going head, you know, completely for it,
B:	I think it's marvelous.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well, Rowlett had sent, sent out a survey, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.
A:	And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably, because they're going to do it.
A:	I don't know how, how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,
A:	but they're, they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months.
B:	Well, does your, uh,
B:	where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?
A:	Um, I've never noticed that.
A:	We don't have a, a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,
A:	so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria. Um,
B:	Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?
A:	Um, no.
A:	There's, there's only one pop machine
A:	and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,
A:	so, uh, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.
B:	So you don't have much choice there.
A:	No
A:	Not, not really.
B:	Well I work at, uh, J C Penny
B:	and last week they brought,
B:	they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they're going to recycle them.
A:	Um.
B:	So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in
B:	and they brought it down to the shelters.
B:	And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of for cans for people have pop,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they put them right near where they have the time cards.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it works great.
B:	And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.
A:	That's good.
B:	So they're really going at it,
B:	and I think it's marvelous because,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.
B:	Well,
A:	And I think they're trying to, to make some changes.
A:	I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,  rather than bag it up, because of all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's, uh, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.
B:	Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?
A:	I saw part of that.
B:	It was good.
B:	The only thing I thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water,  and to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I've already gone to,
B:	oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,
B:	but, yeah
B:	I would say five years ago, turning off my fountain, I mean my water faucet,  in the sink when I brush my teeth.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That was surprising to me.
A:	Um.
B:	I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.
B:	I'm trying to think,
B:	I didn't miss too many,
B:	I can't remember what my score was,
B:	but I did exceeding well.
B:	I was surprised.
B:	But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.
B:	That was a shocker to me.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well there are a lot of things that aren't,
A:	I'm ,
A:	that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,
A:	uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.
A:	I, I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.
B:	Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,
B:	and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,
B:	and it cost more than regular paper.
A:	Um.
B:	And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,
B:	but, It upset me to realize that, hey, the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but people aren't buying it,
B:	so the cost of it is higher.
A:	True.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I noticed that about things like
A:	I I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,
A:	but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,  what the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, in, in terms of that,
A:	it's,
A:	you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,
A:	but the cost is kind of prohibitive.
B:	Now, see that's recycling, you know,
B:	companies that do at least go into it,
B:	I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that people would use this stuff over again.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a good idea.
B:	It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the recycle ones are better to use,
B:	but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.
A:	Yeah,
A:	true.
B:	And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.
B:	I had to put my bifocals on to see it
A:	Um.
B:	That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.
B:	You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,
B:	it's not recyclable.
A:	I, I'd heard something stranger,
A:	talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the,
A:	I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a, a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,
A:	and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes,
B:	Oh.
A:	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.
B:	You know they're,
B:	along that same line, they said they were using, um,
B:	what is, oh, I know,
B:	it was toilets. You know, the old ones? Smashing them up, because they're, that stuff there is great for, in road work.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	And I thought, well, that's good.
B:	And then I saw recycling on tires between, uh,
B:	well, hoses were being used,  and, uh, uh, soaker hoses, made out of old tires.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What else,
B:	something else was made out of old tires,
B:	I was trying to remember what it was. Oh, I can't think of it now.
B:	But I was, I was trying to get my, uh, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,
B:	but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,
B:	and then I forget to bring them in the store.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.
B:	I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I never realized, I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.
A:	Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.
A:	I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in, in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.
B:	You know what I'd like to see a little more.
B:	I don't have any little tiny kids,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	True.
B:	Because it's,
B:	we've all got to do it right now.
B:	I just,
B:	I really amazed to find out that, what is it, eighty per cent are filled now, in, in garbage fills.
B:	In five years we're supposed to be at max.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't think I can keep my own garbage.
B:	I mean, I might not have that much,
B:	but I wouldn't,
B:	I started when I was in college.
B:	You know, they always offer credit cards for college students.
A:	Yes.
B:	So I went ahead, and accepted every one that I was offered. Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	So, I I pack around a lot of them,
B:	but I only use a few of them.
A:	You have a lot of discipline.
A:	They make it really easy for people to, uh, to get credit cards, especially college students.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have, uh, two daughters who, who both are in college
A:	or, in fact, one has finished now.
A:	But they both have a lot of credit cards.
B:	And they give you such high credit limits.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap.
A:	Uh, right.
A:	And then they, they give you, uh, uh, the credit limit,
A:	and then you're always seemingly up to that limit.
A:	Now I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them.
A:	And that's, that's how a lot of people get into trouble.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've got, I've got two that I, you know, that usually I'll have a balance on.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and, and pay it off every month.
A:	Right.
B:	And that way I feel like I'm getting, you know, a thirty day loan.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I don't have to worry about, you know, running them up too high, except at Christmas.
B:	Then they usually go, then they usually get run up pretty good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, you have a lot of discipline.
A:	I, uh, I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine.
A:	I, I've, I've paid off about four credit cards this year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but still I have some that are, are up to the limit.
A:	And especially the Visa Card that you can go and get cash on
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it seems like every time I'm short of cash, I just go get, get it from Visa.
B:	Now that's one, that's
B:	I've never used my Visa for cash before.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Can you use it like at a bank machine
A:	Uh,
B:	or,
A:	Well, uh, you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say, "I want a cash advance."
A:	Or if they've sent you a, uh, a number that you can use. You know, a, a personal identification number that you can use in the, uh, impact machines or whatever, you,  you can do that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Because I have one that I don't have a pin number for.
A:	You know, sometimes you have to ask them for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then I have one that, uh, just gave me the pin number automatically.
B:	Now we got,
B:	that's, that's funny you said that. Because we got a credit card, uh, my husband and I got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now a couple of weeks later we got, we got pin numbers,
B:	and then we got, uh, a bill saying, you know, uh, the yearly fee, it was like forty dollars.
A:	Right.
B:	And we, we cut them up and sent them back because we, we hadn't even applied for them,
B:	and we didn't want them.
B:	But they, they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us.
A:	Oh, wow!
B:	So I thought, man, I don't know if I trust this or not
A:	Well, they, they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time.
A:	everybody in the world will offer you a, a credit card.
B:	It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills
B:	But it's hard,
B:	I mean, it's, it's tempting when you see something to say, "Well, I'll just charge it."
B:	And sometimes I'll do that,
B:	but usually I, I will try to pay everything off the next month
B:	or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time, I'll, I'll pay more than the minimum payment.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Just I I feel like even that little bit helps.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, you know, the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that, I think we, we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible.
A:	That's, that's why I've, I've really started to try to, to pay off mine and get out of debt. Because we never know when we might, you know, get laid off or something.
B:	I know it.
A:	Especially me.
A:	I work for Texas Instruments,
A:	and they've had, had a lot of, of, uh, you know, layoffs lately.
B:	Well, I work for T I too.
A:	You do?
B:	And I think they're getting ready to, to probably sell us out, our division.
A:	Where are you?
B:	In Johnson City, Tennessee.
A:	Johnson City,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	I know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They just, they just announced that, didn't they?
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I mean, it's, it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards.
A:	It, it certainly is.
A:	I've, uh, I have worked on a part, part time job, uh, where I was a collector. For, uh, uh, a jewelry company
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	People, uh, that
A:	they just had this jewelry account.
A:	It was Zales jewelry, in fact.
A:	And, uh, a whole bunch of
A:	I mean they have about a thousand collectors, I guess.
B:	Man!
A:	And, uh, there's just so many people that have bought jewelry, which is really a luxury item
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then they, they just can't pay for it.
A:	Something, something happens,
A:	you know, and you hear so many stories listening to them. Like, uh, you know, they lost their job
A:	or, uh, they, they've signed for a friend.
A:	You know, they got it in their name
A:	but they got it for a friend
B:	Oh.
A:	and then the friend wouldn't pay them.
B:	Didn't pay them.
A:	and now they're stuck with the bill,
A:	and it's ruining their credit
A:	and you really have to watch it, this you know.
B:	Man.
A:	Because,
B:	That's scary.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because every, every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau, you know. Automatically, most of them do.
B:	I didn't realize that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And if you, if you're, uh,
A:	it's bad because if you, you know, your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But, you know, if you, if you pay one day after that fifteenth, you're not one day late,
A:	you're thirty days late.
B:	They don't, they don't recognize any time difference, do they?
A:	Right,
B:	Ooh,
A:	right.
B:	that's scary.
A:	and, anyway, we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of,
B:	That's something I never thought about getting, you know, checking with to see what, what your credit report looked like.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, you know, you, you can do that.
A:	I believe it costs about ten dollars.
B:	Might be worth it for peace of mind.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It is,
A:	it is.
A:	You might even find somebody's been reporting on you
A:	and you didn't even know it.
A:	You know, you, I mean you might think you're paying something on time
A:	or and you, by that day
A:	and you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway. phone line that persists through the end of the recording. Sounds like a cordless phone is being If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's when it really gets bad.
A:	Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days, you know. And things like that
B:	I think that Discover Card has a good idea with, you know, giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you, you purchase. As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And since they don't have the yearly fee.
A:	Do they charge a lot of interest on that card?
B:	I don't know.
A:	I don't,
B:	I've never, I haven't gotten one. Just because it's, uh, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you didn't need another one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I would think it wouldn't be, you know, much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges.
A:	Yeah
B:	So that, that wouldn't be too bad.
A:	Well, always watch out for anybody who bills you out of Atlanta, Georgia.
A:	Or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest.
A:	I know, I had a charge with, uh, Spiegel,
A:	and I hadn't read the, uh, terms of the credit agreement really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, when I did, I, you know, I realized that, that it just looked, seemed like I was never paying the balance off, you know.
A:	And I looked at the credit card agreement one day,
A:	and it was like twenty-three percent interest.
B:	Holy cow!
A:	And that's the one bill that I hurry up, hurried and paid up.
B:	Definitely.
A:	And,  and I've always watched it since then.
B:	That's awful.
A:	You really have to watch those interest rates.
A:	I mean,
B:	I mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to.
A:	That's true.
B:	So,
A:	So anyway, they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent, I think, in, in Texas.
A:	But there, there are a couple of states that can.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.
B:	I'll try to remember that one.
A:	Well,
B:	Well, let's see.
B:	I was trying to think if there was anything else
B:	Uh, the, I guess the worst problem I ever had with, with a credit card though was, um, I got a, an item on my bill that I had never purchased.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork,
B:	but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I changed my mind,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but then they went ahead and charged it on my account.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it took me about eighteen months to get that, all of that mess off of my account.
A:	Wow!
B:	So that's, that's probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card.
A:	I wonder if they ...
A:	Okay.
A:	Hi Norma.
B:	Hi.
A:	Have you taken anything back lately, uh, that you've bought?
B:	Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants.  Shrubbery, that were guaranteed
A:	Well why?
B:	and we had no problem with it.
A:	Very good.
B:	We got our got our money back.
A:	Good.
A:	Well do you think that, uh, consumer goods, goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality?
B:	Well, I believe they're better.
A:	I do too.
A:	I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time,
A:	but I don't,
A:	I, I believe that they're better now,
A:	you know,
B:	I think so.
B:	I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy.
B:	Electrical appliances I think are pretty good, reliable.
A:	however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it.
B:	Right
A:	And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at, uh, on one side.
B:	Oh, did you return it?
A:	No,
A:	I had moved away.
B:	No,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I had taken the first one back.
A:	I didn't think that it heated well enough.
A:	It never did get anything but just moderately warm,
A:	took it back
A:	and, uh, the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be
A:	and I fell for it
A:	and, uh, when I got this one it did, a it heated a little bit warmer
A:	and then after one year it started heating only on one side.
B:	Huh,
B:	so either you or your husband can be warm but not both
A:	Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year.
B:	Oh.
A:	Now I figure uh, anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an iron that will last a long time,
A:	and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
B:	Did they replace it?
A:	Well without even any question,
A:	but I think it was the store.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wal-Mart.
B:	Wal-Mart,
B:	I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart.
A:	Yes
A:	And, uh, well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes?
B:	I haven't bought any new
B:	well the last thing I bought was a dress last Summer.
B:	And the buttons turned on it over the winter.
B:	The buttons tarnished slightly
B:	and I have not gone back about it.
A:	That was poor quality, I think.
B:	I think it is too,
B:	and it was an expensive dress.
A:	I wondered if it weren't expensive,
B:	Yes
B:	it was.
A:	and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's what I think too.
B:	And one belt loop, the uh, you know, like the chain link, chain belt loop half of it raveled out.
A:	Yes.
B:	And that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress
B:	and it was, I think, over a hundred dollars.
A:	You spent that much on your dresses?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't usually,
B:	but I did that one.
A:	You're really divulging very personal information.
B:	But I think it should have been better than that, for that money, is what I mean.
A:	Oh, of course, I do too.
A:	Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes.
B:	Okay,
B:	I think so.
A:	And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you.
B:	Good talking to you too,
B:	I've enjoyed it
A:	You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on it all the time.
B:	Well, we'll be talking to you later.
A:	Bye, bye.
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	And, uh, what part of Virginia, uh?
B:	Uh, I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg.
A:	Blacksburg.
A:	Okay,
A:	I've been,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	have you ever heard of Virginia Tech?
A:	Sounds vaguely familiar.
B:	V P I.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	I, I hadn't been down in that part of the state really.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, we vacation a lot.
B:	How about you?
B:	Quite frequently.
A:	Uh, I wish we did
B:	Well, we retired early
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	so, we're, we take trips pretty often.
A:	Where all you guys go?
B:	Well, we go to Maine every Fall
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast
A:	Uh-uh.
B:	and I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,
B:	so we go out there
B:	and we go to Florida
A:	Uh.
B:	and down, oh,
B:	we were just out recently at the outer banks of North Carolina.
A:	All these places that I've never been
B:	Is that right
B:	Where do you go?
A:	Uh
B:	What type of vacation?
A:	well, it really depends,
A:	I mean, uh, seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately,
A:	uh, my, uh, fiancee's family's from Wisconsin
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we've been out there a couple of times
A:	and, uh, I, uh, went to Purdue for a couple of years,
A:	so I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, uh, I'm a real big baseball fan
A:	so I usually try to combine it with, uh, catching a couple of games somewhere.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What club do you follow?
A:	I'm, uh, I'm a big Red Sox fan,
B:	Red
B:	good,
A:	but, uh, I, uh,
B:	me too
A:	uh, you're a Red Sox fan too?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I usually try to catch whoever's in town though, I don't specifically,
A:	I, you know, go to Cleveland to see them play,  the Indians or the Red Sox,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, uh, that's about it,
A:	we don't, I mean, we do a lot of little trips around here, uh,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains
B:	or,
A:	Not that much.
A:	We've gone out to, um, uh, a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, have you ever heard of it?
B:	I've heard of it.
B:	I've never been there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's really neat.
A:	It's this house built on, on a waterfall
A:	and it's, uh, really cool
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there,
A:	uh, the first time we went out there was, uh, the day after hurricane Hugo had come through
B:	Gee.
A:	So, I mean they, they didn't have any power
A:	and it was really cold and, and rainy
A:	and, uh, we went up about a year later
A:	and it was better but not a whole,  lot better
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, where else did we go, uh,
A:	we've gone to Richland, last year and, uh, had a good time,  down there.
B:	Oh, did you?
B:	Did you go,  to Williamsburg,
B:	have you been down there?
A:	Uh, my girlfriend has with her sisters
A:	but I haven't been,  down there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I hear that's nice.
A:	We're going to get down, probably down Norfork sometime this Summer,  just to see why, catch a football game actually
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	We were down,
B:	well, when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night.
A:	Uh, spend a day and a lot of money
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've heard, uh,
A:	I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the, of the price attached,  to it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We just,
A:	we,
A:	I,
B:	But it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around, if you like to walk,
B:	it's a good town to just,  walk in.
A:	Uh.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	we'll,  do that.
B:	You can go,  to the buildings and not go in if you're not,
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	so I can wander around without,
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can wander,
B:	it's a good town to wander in.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings?
B:	That's right.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I didn't know that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, uh, they do the whole with, you know, paying,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they really did throw away a lot of money to get, getting one thing or another,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they had a good time
A:	so.
B:	We really didn't do that really this time, we just, uh, visited around.
A:	Uh, uh,
B:	We've done it a couple of times
B:	and that's enough for, uh, probably another twenty years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was, uh,
A:	we use it live in California
A:	and, uh, my, um,
A:	up, up around San Francisco,
A:	and, uh, there was one year when my father was, uh, my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles,
A:	so, my father was working down in Los Angeles for like, uh, six months or so,
A:	uh, actually I think it was closer, I think to a full year
A:	and, you know, we'd, he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays,
A:	well, any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles,
A:	so I saw, I went to Disneyland about five times,  in one year
B:	Oh
A:	and I really have no great urge to go back now.
B:	That's great as a kid though, isn't it, I mean,
A:	Oh, it was great, because, uh, well, the times that were really fun were when, uh, we had vacation
A:	but the kids in Los Angeles didn't
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so we basically had one of the parks.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, Disneyland, I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland,
A:	but there was another, um, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens, uh,
A:	there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times,
A:	we just get, get done with them and they go, oh, do you want to go again,
A:	sure.
B:	Have you ever,
B:	you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney
A:	No,
A:	I'd like to,  sometime
B:	that's good,
A:	but,
B:	we, we really enjoy that,
B:	we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've never been,
A:	the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, I, um, keep wanting to get further,
A:	you know, I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers,  ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but never did it.
B:	Charleston is a really nice place to visit.
A:	My, uh, my sister lives in Charlotte
A:	and they've gone to,  Charleston a couple of times and had a real good,  time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a real pretty place.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	one of these days we'll get down there, although I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it
A:	We're, uh, we're getting married in about,  a year
B:	Oh, are you.
A:	and,   our honeymoon, we're going up to this, um, uh, place in Wisconsin called Door County,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it's up by Green Bay.
A:	It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted,  to go,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Is it on, uh, one of the lakes?
A:	It's, um, uh,
A:	I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin
A:	but there's kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, uh, in the Lake Michigan,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that's Door County
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	yeah,
B:	that would,  be really nice.
A:	So,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they call it the Cape Cod of the, uh,  the Midwest
B:	Oh
A:	so, uh, we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she, uh, she had this, uh, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	sounds good.
A:	so, uh, that should be a lot of fun.
B:	Well, I don't know what our next trip will be, I guess our next,
B:	well, I know what my next trip, I'm going to be a grandmother in July
A:	Oh.
B:	The first, the first one,
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	so my next trip is going to be to Texas
A:	Oh, that'll be fun
B:	Yeah,
B:	in the middle, in the middle of the Summer.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	you won't even,  notice it though
B:	Well, they'll be air-conditioning anyway
B:	so.
A:	Is that, is that how you got into this, uh, this,  you know, uh, data base?
B:	Yeah,
B:	my daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments,  and working on this project.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was, I was just,
A:	I mean most of the people I've talk to are from, are from Texas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, when I, you know, when I heard you were from Virginia I was like, oh, okay, there's somebody different,
A:	and you said, oh, I got somebody down in Texas,
A:	I go, okay, that the connection,  right there
B:	That's it,
B:	yeah
B:	I talked to one in California,
B:	I never asked him the other day how he was connected,
B:	I don't think he was T I employee.
A:	Uh, I, uh,
A:	most people talk to Texas,
A:	there's been a couple of other the people, uh, most of whom are like me that work in, in speech labs that are going to use data base,  eventually.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So, uh, it was fun
A:	I, actually yesterday, I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in.
B:	Is that right.
B:	Well, we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just,  moved to back East from Oklahoma,
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she's, uh, working on this project too,
B:	I mean she's talking on the project too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we got back Monday
B:	and I got a call yesterday
B:	and it was her, on T I Network
A:	Uh, that's neat.
A:	I haven't, uh, I haven't had something like that happen, just, uh, just getting the one guy,  from the lab.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, you're sure have a nice town,
A:	uh, my, uh, sister lives on Lake,  Norman, just,
B:	Oh, does,  she,
B:	that's nice out there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the Summer
A:	and it's,  never really works out.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's real pretty.
A:	Yeah
B:	Well
A:	Traffic , not much else we do for vacation really,
A:	uh, just so we don't, haven't been able to take really.
B:	Are you a golfer?
B:	No.
A:	No.
B:	Me either.
A:	No.
A:	Are you guys,  golfers
B:	No,
B:	uh-huh,
A:	or, uh,
B:	no,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	nope,
B:	not too much into sports.
A:	Except our outside , though.
B:	Just walking that's all
A:	Oh, I don't think there are any, traveling that was in my early teens down in that area
A:	and I'm know real sure there are, um,
B:	No professionals
A:	When, uh,
A:	I was thinking I might be minor league
A:	but,
B:	Oh, there's one in Salem, Salem Rebels.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Salem Rebels,
A:	Buccaneers.
B:	Buccaneers.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, yeah,
A:	I may be seeing them, um, in a town just west of here, Frederick has a, uh, has a minor league team that plays in the same league with Salem
A:	and, uh, I think we may be seeing them this,  weekend
B:	Oh,
B:	is that right up there in Frederick?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think they're out of town.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, that's a nice little town actually, Frederick, uh,
B:	I've never been up there.
B:	I've never visited Baltimore.
B:	I'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime.
A:	Oh, there's, there's some nice things in Baltimore, you know,
A:	the Inner Harbor and the, uh, the Aquarium and all that are very nice.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, they've just done a, uh,
A:	you known, I,
A:	you know, the Aquarium is one of those things that, you know, because everybody,
A:	Okay.
A:	uh, we're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores,
A:	do you have either one?
B:	Well, I don't do anything with the lawn really,
B:	but I do gardening,  both flowers and vegetable gardening.
A:	Do you .
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Um, I,
B:	we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
B:	and that's fun,
B:	well, actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because, um, we enjoy that.
B:	We love fresh vegetables in the summer,
B:	and it's just one of the things I enjoy doing.
A:	So do I.
A:	I would,
A:	I had rather be outside than, than inside any day.
B:	So would I
A:	Do you work during the week, uh, outside the home?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward,
B:	I work for a school system
B:	so I'm able to do that, um, because I get home a little earlier,
A:	Yes.
B:	and I can still do some, some sorts of things
B:	but,
A:	Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight.
B:	Oh, absolutely
A:	Well, I unfortunately am not gardening this year.
A:	I love gardening,
A:	in fact, I was prevented at like no, about thirty years ago with a life membership, uh, from the Richmond, Virginia counsel of garden clubs.
B:	Wow.
A:	And it wasn't because I was so good,
A:	but I organized a very large garden club,
A:	but I still have, uh,
B:	Oh, that's wonderful.
A:	It, well, it's always something that seems so odd to me
A:	but, uh,
B:	But that, that's,
B:	and you really feel you can accomplish something
B:	and to help other people too, that's neat.
A:	Yes,
A:	it has really nothing to do with, uh, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it was just that I happened to organize this group,  that was about seventy people.
B:	Right.
B:	That's wonderful.
A:	That,
A:	isn't,
A:	yeah,
A:	that, that,
B:	Yeah.
A:	those numbers were, were great
A:	but it,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I think it sounds good.
B:	I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own,
B:	I've never had,  the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format,
A:	Yes.
B:	but I know people who do it and, and enjoy it very much.
A:	Well, and actually, I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past, uh, are only flowers,
A:	what I would like,
A:	we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma.
A:	Just moved to, to North Carolina,
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, we were originally, of course, from this area, from Virginia,
A:	but, uh, in North, uh,
A:	in Oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join.
B:	My word.
A:	And you would have because they do all kinds of, uh, gardening and not just flowers like women do.
B:	For heaven's sake.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, um, there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of,
B:	they're, they're women.
B:	But, um, and usually they're the tea type things, you know, where they have a little luncheon
B:	and they do their thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, flowers are primarily the emphasis,  um, whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more, I do flowers sort of look pretty
A:	Yes,
A:	I think so too.
B:	but I, I really like to do the vegetables.
A:	Yes,
A:	and, and I have spent the last ten, ten years being a florist.
B:	Being what?
A:	Being a florist.
B:	Oh, my.
B:	Well, what a wonderful thing.
A:	It was nice,
A:	it was exhilarating, uh, for many years.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, many of those tanned until the last couple when, uh, we had such an economic slowdown.
B:	Oh, terrible
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, tell me what's in your garden this year, since I don't have one.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, uh, the flowers I'm just,
B:	in fact, I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in,
B:	I, I always have geraniums
B:	and,  um, and then I have a shady area that I need to, uh, be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I've discovered that, uh, impatiens that tried and true is, turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus. Because they, uh, look pretty and, in my front garden, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't,
B:	they look sort of like impatiens,
B:	you know, but they're not quite
B:	and they're better for the sun areas.
B:	Um, and, of course, you know, the, mine are old theory ordinary flowers, marigolds and, and that sort of thing.
A:	Yes.
B:	In my,
A:	Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds?
B:	No.
B:	I don't.
A:	Maybe it's,
B:	I don't know,
B:	maybe this climate is a little better.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, but in the vegetable garden we grow, um, usually, what
B:	our favorite is something called white half runner green beans ,
B:	now that's,
A:	Do you,
A:	isn't that funny,
A:	so is my favorite.
B:	Well, you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina,
A:	Okay.
B:	and that was my mother's, um, favorite bean
B:	she she always grows, you know, five different varieties,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that's the kind that produces the best.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I think it has the best flavor.
B:	And, and they're wonderful,
B:	and I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit,
B:	my mother picks them when they're fat
B:	and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs ,
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	well, I like them in between.
B:	and they're good both ways.
A:	I like them in between.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	The flavor is better I think in between.
B:	Oh, in between the
B:	size wise
B:	yeah,
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My mother,
B:	Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them
A:	Well, and I know I love them,
A:	well, that's the yankee way.
A:	But I think,  that's like another vegetable.
B:	Oh, of course.
A:	I love them that way just, just the thrill of,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	They're two different vegetables that way,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	In fact, I, my mother, who is eighty-six years old, canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	My does, mother will be ninety this year
B:	and she lives in western North Carolina
B:	and, uh, she would do that if, if we didn't tell her that she'd better not
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	yes.
B:	But she doesn't have that big a garden,
B:	but she has a bigger one than I do.
A:	yes.
B:	And I have four children, you know,
B:	so,
A:	And she tends to it herself?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	oh, yes.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	isn't that wonderful.
B:	Oh, it is,
B:	it's great.
B:	It's, it's really her joy
B:	and I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening,  because, you know, growing up with it.
A:	I think so too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We also grow, um, yellow and green squash,  um, much to my children's chagrin,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, we grow a lot of tomatoes, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes.
A:	No.
B:	So, we enjoy that,
B:	um, we grow
B:	I, I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family
B:	but I actually was successful for the last two years,
B:	so.
A:	Wonderful.
B:	I'm going to do it again.
A:	Bet you showed them.
B:	That's right.
B:	And we grow broccoli.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I have been very, uh, happy about the new way of controlling the, the, uh, worm that gets in broccoli, um, by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the, uh, little,
B:	well, in fact, that's what they use for gypsy moth,
B:	I don't know if you have had that problem there or not.
A:	No.
B:	But it's, you know, it's a problem that's, that's moving south from, from the New England area.
A:	Yes.
B:	And they devastate the trees
B:	so they, they spray, the government, uh, sprays, um, two, three times in the spring when the, uh, caterpillars are, are coming along because what they do, this, this, uh, bacillus, um, the worms ingest it
B:	and it expands in their, in their, um, digestive tract
B:	and they die.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, that's the same technique that is, you know, for any of the other, uh, little varmints that get in vegetables
B:	so it,
B:	that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of, of handling the problem.
A:	Great.
A:	Well, we could we could really talk gardening a long time.
A:	I'm enjoying hearing you so much
B:	Well, it's nice hearing you talk
B:	and I'm, I wish you, uh, good luck,
B:	have you just recently moved to Charlotte?
A:	Um,
A:	no,
A:	October.
B:	Oh, so, well, that's not very long.
A:	Uh, so, yes,
A:	recently seven months
A:	and it,
B:	Yes.
A:	the weather is wonderful,
A:	I love it.
B:	Oh, that's great,
B:	that's great.
A:	It is just terrific,
A:	you know, rains a little too often.
B:	Well, I hope you have a, an opportunity to garden again.
A:	Oh, I think so,
A:	I have a little spinach
B:	Oh, well, good
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	so, um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years?
B:	Uh, I'm at a little bit of a loss,
B:	you know, I don't know,
B:	ten years ago,
B:	see I'm what, I'm about, uh, twenty-eight now
B:	so when I was eighteen,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	things haven't changed a whole lot.
A:	Really.
B:	People are being a little more, oh, I don't know, a little a little less bigoted in some ways,
B:	I don't know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	seems to me.
A:	Well,
B:	I guess I'm like my parents.
B:	The younger generation gets away with hell,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
B:	but that may just be because I've changed.
B:	You know, I used to live up north.
B:	Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant
A:	Really.
B:	but, uh,
A:	Where'd you live up,
A:	where'd you live at,
B:	I lived in Akron, Ohio.
A:	Oh, did you?
A:	I'm from , Illinois,
A:	so.
B:	Oh.
A:	How long, how long you been in Dallas?
B:	Oh, about eight years.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think,
A:	Yeah, uh
A:	you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it's,
B:	crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I agree.
B:	and maybe that has a lot to do with it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse,
A:	and you know, I, I think there's,
A:	to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	So,
B:	That's true,
A:	But, uh,
B:	I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that's more a matter of,
B:	you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work, and things like that than there used to be
A:	and,
B:	Hello.
B:	Somebody's at the door.
A:	So.
B:	Hang on just a second.
A:	Okay.
B:	off Okay.
A:	But, uh, I don't know,
A:	that's just, that's one thing I see, I see a lot more, you know, double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	it's getting more and more expensive to live.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's for sure.
B:	You can't, you can't make it,
A:	Yeah,
A:	without it hardly,
A:	that's right.
B:	I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a, get a home and buy house,
B:	and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	you know, you just don't buy a house,
A:	just because they can't get into one,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so. Yeah,
A:	that's, that's a good point
A:	so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	for me it's kind of hard,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I think,
B:	I don't know, I think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I agree.
B:	and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around.
A:	Well, I hope so, you know, at some point
A:	but I don't know at what point,
B:	But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, uh
A:	Yeah,
B:	so, usually is I think.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	It's hard for me to say.
B:	I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those that gets caught.
B:	But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs to be, be changed.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	Do you work at T I?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	What, uh, department do you work in?
B:	I'm in semiconductor.
A:	Are you?
A:	I'm in semiconductor division too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. How long you been with them, since you moved down here?
B:	About eight years,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, I'm over at the Center One building.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so am I.
A:	Are you really.
A:	What floor?
B:	Two.
A:	I'm on the seventh floor.
B:	Well,
A:	How about that.
A:	Well, it's a small world.
A:	So, so let's see,
A:	second floor, you work with, uh, linear.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you. Do you, uh, do you know Alec Morton?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've probably seen him around.
A:	Oh, you do, huh.
A:	Well, he comes up and pushes us around
A:	so, uh, so I'm pretty familiar with,
B:	Are you D A D or something up there?
A:	Huh?
B:	Are you D A D or something?
A:	Yeah
A:	Yep,
A:	you must know him.
A:	His reputation precedes him.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, seventh floor.
A:	Yeah,
B:	T A D,
A:	Well, uh, he, uh, boy, he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief.
A:	They, they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D grief,
A:	so I can believe it
A:	but,
B:	Well.
A:	Yeah,
A:	let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about how long,
A:	I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess.
A:	Um, been with T I like twelve,
A:	but I started out in Lubbock.
A:	Lubbock is,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	flat, dry and dirty,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too,
A:	I mean, here in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I lived in the country for several years,
B:	and living in the city is a whole different uh, social structure
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	but, uh,
A:	Well, I got some friends that, uh,
A:	seems like he went to school at like DeVry.
A:	Is there a DeVry in Akron?
B:	I don't even know
A:	Oh,
B:	I haven't been up there in years.
A:	Oh, I see,
A:	well, he went to school somewhere in Ohio,
A:	and he's from that area,
A:	and, uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think
A:	but, uh, I haven't talked to him in a while,
A:	but, um, yeah,
A:	he, he misses it.
A:	He used to go back twice or three times a year, you know, because he missed it.
A:	Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while.
B:	No,
B:	I haven't been back in ten, fifteen years.
A:	You still have relatives back there
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do,
B:	I just haven't had a chance to get back
A:	Oh.
B:	Catch them next year probably.
A:	Really.
A:	Well, let's see,
A:	how, how long are we supposed to talk here?
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think we ran out of social, social changes to talk about,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well my kids are probably needing me to go
A:	so
B:	Okay,
A:	all right,
A:	well, it's nice talking to you.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Talk to you later.
B:	All righty,
B:	bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	Well, Kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system?
A:	I certainly do.
A:	Uh, I think ... I think we have a lousy school system.
B:	And what do you think that problem is?
A:	And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well.
A:	And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents.
A:	And then, oh, we don't, uh, we put too much, uh, responsibility on the teachers, for things that are really not education.
A:	They're social services.
B:	Huh. That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.
A:	Well, I, as a matter of fact, I just finished editing a book on the topic.
A:	So I have some rather strong opinions.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	Do you, like a uh, yourself ...
A:	And, and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited.
B:	Do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system?
A:	Yes,
A:	I do.
A:	And I was not very happy with the results.
B:	I see.
B:	So if you were to improve it, what would you do to improve it?
A:	Well, I think I would start with a with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators. And all the auxiliary personnel. The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And then I would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	And then let them try some innovative things and see what  works. And then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things. And then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. Get involved.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pay attention to what's happening. Talk to the teachers. Uh, talk to their kids about school. And support the institution
A:	and,
A:	instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the, uh, the teacher's in the middle.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's, uh, some pretty good ideas.
B:	Why don't you do something with those
A:	Well, I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, you should, uh, run for a school board position.
A:	Oh, well. That I'm not so sure about.
A:	I've got a lot of things to keep me busy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That ...
A:	Have you done anything like that?
A:	Anything political?
B:	Well, my mother was on the school board. As we were coming up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, that, basically, is the extent to which our, our family has been directly, you know,
B:	they've always been involved.
B:	My parents through the, the P T A organization.
B:	And my mother was on the school board for eight years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, that was, that's the extent of which I guess that's more than, than some people, less than others
A:	That's more than a lot
B:	I would, uh, tend to agree with you that there is a problem
B:	The methods of correcting it I haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have.
B:	But I believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And if there was a way to, through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little, uh, uh, a little more prestige to being a teacher.
B:	And with that, of course, you know, you have to pay them a, accordingly.
B:	If we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then if you paid them more, you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them.
A:	I think that's absolutely right.
A:	They,
A:	the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going to be, uh, rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job. And instead of getting the, uh, improvement that we want.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	So we'd have to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and  more money.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible  as other ones
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's hard to tell.
B:	so it's very, it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than I guess how, you how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class.
B:	You know, if there's some gauge that they could make.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, also, I've I've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the
B:	before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. So much like a doctor.
B:	Maybe not the four years definitely.
B:	But some certain type of, of position where you're overseen to begin with.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now that's a very good suggestion.
B:	Uh, just something to,
B:	rather than throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think student, I don't think student teaching is enough.
B:	I thought that maybe something.
A:	I think  that, at least what I used to observe in student teaching, was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with, was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So there really was no time to try, much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the, the student teacher improve very much.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	There are lots of things that could be done in that line, including things like video taping. Because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape, uh, either a master teacher teaching a class so that then, students could watch that and, uh, criticize the methods used and, and analyze it. Figure out what worked and what didn't work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	That's good as a, a, a teaching aid.
B:	But more you see these commercials that have Jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in New York while Jimmy's in Rome.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea.
B:	I don't know if I I'm in favor  yeah, in favor of, yeah,
A:	I don't think that's going to work.
B:	I think, especially in the younger years you need to have more of the, the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to, to learn how to learn.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort of, of say a national curriculum. Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for, uh, curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California.
A:	And then everybody else is stuck with that, regardless of what they want to teach.
B:	Huh.
B:	Is that  because that's where the two biggest markets are
A:	Because it ...
B:	or?
A:	Well, that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis.
B:	I see.
A:	Uh, and so it, uh,
A:	I used to work for a textbook publisher
A:	and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas, then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject
A:	and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted  in the individual school districts.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, you know, a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	And then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have to follow along and take what Texas gets.
B:	Right.
A:	California is the biggest for elementary schools
A:	but Texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.
B:	I see.
B:	Well, definitely is a national problem if, that they need to address.
A:	Yep.
A:	Sure is.
B:	Definitely is.
A:	And I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with, uh, Reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying to do some, uh, trying to produce some new programs anyway.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Excuse me.
B:	Well, I've enjoyed speaking with you.
A:	I have got to go.
A:	I've got another line calling.
A:	Thanks.
B:	All righty.
B:	Good-bye
A:	Bye
A:	Okay,
A:	sorry.
B:	Wow,
B:	that's okay
B:	So, tell me about your home.
A:	Oh, it's, uh, it looks like a little shot gun house, almost.
A:	It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's, uh, an older home,
A:	it's not new,
A:	I like it though,
A:	it's big.
B:	Oh really,
B:	what kind of square footage?
A:	Oh, I wouldn't know,
A:	I measured it one time,  because I was, uh, we had saw some termites
B:	Uh.
A:	and we thought about getting it sprayed.
A:	I think it was like,
A:	I can't remember,
A:	I'm sorry
B:	That's okay,
B:	that's okay.
A:	It's big enough for us, though.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We kind of need maybe one more room.
A:	We've got two children.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	okay.
B:	So where do you live at,
B:	I mean what part of town. In here in Denison.
A:	Okay,
A:	see, that's north.
B:	Or down here in Denison,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	I live, I live in Plano,
A:	so it's north to me
B:	Okay,
B:	up here then
A:	I say down,
A:	I'm really from Kentucky.
B:	I was going to say you didn't have the typical,
B:	you have a southern accent,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you don't have a Texas accent.
A:	Right.
B:	Well I'm originally from, uh, Ohio, Cincinnati,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	so I'm uh, familiar with, uh,
A:	That area,
A:	that dialect.
B:	Right,
B:	right
B:	Also I lived in Georgia for about four years,
B:	so the, uh,
B:	there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south.  And, uh, the way in which people speak.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Anyway, my home is, um, I guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot
B:	and I have, uh, four bedrooms at the present.
B:	We're busting out walls and things like that.
A:	That's what I want to do.
A:	How many kids do you have?
B:	We have two,
B:	we have two.
A:	Do you have enough bedroom space, then?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we'll have enough bedroom space,
B:	it's,
B:	we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.
A:	That's kind of like what we'd like to do.
A:	We just had a baby a couple months ago
A:	and we've got a den,
A:	it's more or less a spare room.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter
A:	and, uh, we need the one extra room.
A:	Like, like you said, our rooms are too the bedrooms are too small,
A:	the living room and kitchen are huge,
B:	Right.
A:	but the bedrooms are too small.
A:	Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.
B:	Right,
B:	there's they, uh,
B:	I know what you're saying there,
B:	ours is the same
B:	and they tend to put windows in the strangest places.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for,
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything,
B:	so.
A:	No privacy.
B:	No,
B:	we don't have a lot of that,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.
A:	It,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'd hate to clean these windows,
A:	I really would.
B:	I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.
B:	Ours are the double pane
B:	and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.
A:	Ours are those too,
A:	yeah.
A:	You must live in an older home too then.
B:	Right,
B:	I do,
B:	the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's not a new home,
B:	it's, it's seen some wear and tear. You know.
A:	Ours has too.
A:	When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he did it hisself,
A:	so most of that, by now, is falling apart.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know, well I mean, it's not just horrible,
A:	but like this tile's come loose off the wall,
A:	the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
A:	and I don't like that at all.
B:	Um, that is awful.
A:	With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,  the, the huge one.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	he did it in that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	instead of wallpaper.
A:	I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,
A:	for that you put,
B:	The normal tiles,
B:	right.
A:	right
A:	that you put around a bathtub,
A:	that would be prettier.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But this looks like floor covering on the wall.
A:	It just doesn't look good.
B:	Oh, and also they're very heavy
B:	and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.
A:	Right,
A:	there's one big one that has come off
A:	and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,
A:	so.
B:	Um.
A:	And he rewired the house
A:	and it's shorting out here and there,
A:	and
B:	Oh, wow,
B:	I,
B:	that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay.
B:	We don't have a, we don't have enough power,
B:	um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves
B:	but our plumbing is awful.
B:	There is there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,
A:	Um.
B:	and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,
B:	so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,  you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we never know where it's going to flood.
A:	We've got power surges on the west side of our house.
A:	We've got our stereo hooked up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that,
A:	the power makes it run.
A:	It's never ran,
A:	it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal.
B:	Um.
A:	And then the power went off again,
A:	lightning or something knocked it out
A:	and we hooked it back up
A:	and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.
B:	Um.
A:	But on the east side of the house it runs fine.
B:	Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.
A:	He put new wiring in,
A:	it's all new wiring up in the attic,  or I guess crawl space,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, oh, no,
A:	he didn't know what he was doing,
A:	he really should have hired people.
B:	Well that's something,
B:	my husband's in construction
B:	and he won't even touch electrical stuff.
B:	He,
B:	I mean, he'll do a little things
B:	but he won't do any major rewiring.
B:	He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.
A:	Right,
A:	he'll end up killing himself.
B:	Pardon.
A:	End up killing theirselves.
B:	That's right.
A:	My husband, he'll change out a light switch,
A:	but that's about as far as he'll go.
B:	Well that's the way mine is, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around
B:	and he was like, oh my God,
B:	he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.
B:	And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,
A:	Uh, was a what,
B:	The roof was really sorry.
B:	I mean when we moved in,  we had no idea how bad it was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was a wood shingle roof,
B:	and we,
B:	the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof.
A:	Well he put,
A:	which
A:	I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles.
A:	Is it three or five,
A:	your husband probably knows.
B:	He probably knows,
B:	I don't know what it is off hand.
A:	Well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,
A:	and he told us it was a completely new roof.
A:	Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he must not of.
B:	We stripped ours, we stripped ours off.
B:	We didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on.
B:	And we completely completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And we, and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off,
B:	and it did this.
A:	And, uh, uh, a house full of snow.
B:	And a house full of snow, and rain,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it came down,
B:	it did this in the middle of the night.
B:	We have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could,  real thick edge stuff, I mean,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the wind came in from the north
B:	and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
B:	and we were asleep
B:	and, and I woke up
B:	and I got up
B:	and it was about four o'clock in the morning
B:	and I heard all these, these drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	I had water coming in every light fixture.
A:	That,
A:	yeah.
B:	I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere.
B:	And I mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I would go in,
B:	and I'd turn on a light in the room, you know
B:	and the light would come on
B:	and the whole thing would be full of water.
B:	And I mean the light would still come on.
B:	It didn't blow up or anything
A:	My neighbor, or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana, her,
A:	we all lived on base,
A:	my husband was in the Army.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.
A:	The neighbor's uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,
A:	I don't know
A:	but it was leaking, just pouring water in
A:	and it all went through to her roof
A:	and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.
B:	Oh.
A:	The fire alarm went off for some reason.
A:	It shorted it out, or something.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that will happen.
A:	So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house.
B:	Oh, my lord.
A:	No,
A:	not six feet
A:	but,
B:	But it's quite a bit, quite a bit,
B:	you know that,
A:	Yeah
A:	you might as well
A:	so. Did you have carpets and stuff?
B:	Oh, several of our rooms got ruined,
B:	we have, um,
B:	we are on pier and beam,
B:	we don't have concrete slab underneath our house,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so it, it got into the carpeting, got into the floor.
B:	The carpeting was already awful anyway,
B:	but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
A:	Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too.
B:	Oh really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they came in
B:	and they had it,
B:	one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it.
B:	We had to call the insurance company.
B:	I mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
B:	but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired. You know, which really wasn't our fault.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather. You know, and stuff
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	and,
A:	Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end.
B:	Oh yeah
B:	it,
A:	Are you finished with it now?
B:	Uh, the roof?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's, it's been done for quite some time.
B:	We're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	how long have you lived there?
B:	Uh, see, it's three,
B:	it's just been at three years.
B:	We've been in the house just the three years.
B:	We've been doing a lot of remodeling.
B:	I mean, it's, it had detached, it had a detached garage
B:	and my husband's built a walkway across
B:	and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
B:	so we,
A:	You all did it yourselves?
B:	What, uh, the walk?
A:	The home improvements.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	he see he does this for a living,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean this is what,
A:	All right.
A:	Well, uh, quite a few
A:	and they're varied.
A:	They don't, uh, uh, encompass, uh, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I do, uh, quite a bit of wreath making
A:	and my dogs are my hobbies.
A:	I do a lot of gardening.
A:	I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, what do you mostly do
B:	Well, mostly right now I'm a, I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible.
B:	We're, uh, we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff,
A:	Oh,
B:	so.
A:	boy
B:	Yeah.
A:	That should be fun.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Fun for them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How old are they?
B:	Uh, I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three.
A:	Well, I think that's better than having that party at home
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, this is a friend's party
B:	and they, they rented,
B:	or, you know, they,
B:	the party,
B:	they, uh, just rent skates and stuff for the kids.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh  they're,  they're looking forward to it.
A:	And,  the  the, the skating rink does the rest practically,  I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Boy, what a help that is.
B:	Yeah
B:	So, uh,
A:	What kind of,
B:	how long have you lived in North Carolina?
A:	Well, not that long.
B:	Really?
A:	Uh, just since October.
A:	We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, we are, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, we needed to get back, uh to our older parents.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I am loving it
A:	The weather is divine.
B:	Really?
A:	Yes.
B:	uh,
B:	did you like Oklahoma,  while you were there?
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Very much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, what did you all do?
A:	Well, my husband was with, uh, begins to be much clearer, a lot less back ground noise and University of Oklahoma and,  Phillips University in Enid.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then he went with, uh, a family corporation that had, uh, has oil and ranching and varied enterprises.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, he just quit a perfectly good job and came, we came East
B:	Really?
A:	Yes.
B:	So, is, uh, is he working there then
B:	or
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's doing, uh, quite a bit of consulting work and,  has been offered a permanent position
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and he's contemplating
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He, he's liking this free time actually
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It's just wonderful after all,  these years of working.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, how did, how did you get, uh, hooked up with the T I switchboard thing?
A:	Um, a gal who works, uh, with T I on this project
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think she's a temporary worker
A:	Uh, mother is my best friend  in Virginia
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country.
B:	I see.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	my wife has talked more than I have, uh,
B:	she's talked to four, five different people.
B:	It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas.
B:	In fact, she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina, I think.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, what is her name?
B:	Her name's Tina
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I haven't talked to her.
A:	I haven't,  I haven't talked to a Tina yet
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, the, the call was probably for her.
B:	They wouldn't accept my, uh, T I N number,
B:	so we put hers in.
B:	But, uh, uh, like I said, we're getting, getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, some of
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I've only talked to one or two
B:	and they've, they've all been in Dallas.
B:	But, she hasn't talked to anybody, in Dallas, yet.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, that's interesting.
A:	Well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in.
B:	Well, the sport I like best probably is basketball.
B:	But, uh, I guess I'm probably better at softball.
B:	And so I'd,
B:	like during the summer months it's, occupies quite a bit of my,  time.
A:	Yes.
B:	But, I play in a couple of leagues and, and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend.
B:	But, my family usually goes with me.
B:	We try to do everything we can together.
A:	Well, I think that's, uh, easy entertainment for a,  family, too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, they, uh,
B:	a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams, we, uh,
B:	that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff,
B:	and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age.
B:	So they play together,  pretty well
A:	Under the stands.
B:	and,
A:	Under the, bleachers.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	pretty much.
B:	And, uh, Tina enjoys, uh, the other lady, real well.
B:	So they,
B:	you know, that's kind of nice.
B:	It's like getting together with,  them.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, it's getting,  a little hot, isn't it?
B:	So to speak.
A:	It,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it's been raining a lot here so far.
B:	So we haven't really had any kind of real heat.
B:	I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon, we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in, in the house.
B:	So, it looks like an air conditioner,  day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	It sure does.
A:	Or maybe this evening anyway.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It,
B:	yeah,
B:	but, you know, I'm sure you're familiar with that living,  here.
A:	Very,  much so.
B:	We go, we go through Enid, you know, quite a bit.
B:	We go to Tulsa from time to time.
B:	And my, my parents live in southern Illinois.
B:	So, we drive,  up there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, well, lot of times we take seventy-five
B:	and, uh, it seems like, seems like that goes through Enid, I know,
A:	No.
A:	No
A:	it doesn't.
B:	I've either seen the signs or,
A:	Enid is, uh,
A:	it's in the northwest.
A:	It's, uh, directly across the straight, uh, state from Tulsa.
A:	Uh,
B:	Um. I know I've seen, the sign somewhere.
A:	Sure you have.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, Enid is, not, uh, an unknown little city.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It, uh
B:	Right.
A:	an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there.
A:	And it,  was, uh, a very, uh, self-sufficient, uh, wealthy uh, town, for a long time, anyway You know until, uh, everything happened,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the bottom fell out.
A:	But,
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	it's beginning to do well.
A:	But, there's a lot of, uh, old time wealth there that, has helped to stabilize things.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, how
B:	you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like,  six months then is,
A:	Yes.
A:	Something like that.
B:	And you really like,  it there, huh?
A:	Oh.
B:	I've heard so many people talk about that area.
B:	I've never been there
A:	Well  it's, it's and children in the  pretty.
B:	but they sure,  say it's pretty.
A:	The weather is wonderful.
A:	Uh, this winter we,
A:	it was just,
A:	we had so many wonderful days.
A:	And,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I,
A:	if it got to be forty degrees, I decided it was too cold to, to walk the dogs
A:	Isn't it, funny how how, your standards change
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It really does.
B:	My wife and I spent a couple years, uh, doing church work up in the state of Washington right,  on the coast.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it rains, you know, a lot there.
A:	Sure.
B:	But, you get used to it.
B:	I mean, it's like a fine mist all the time
B:	and it doesn't really,
B:	it gets to where it doesn't bother, you.
A:	Well, foggy and, misty.
B:	Really?
B:	It,
A:	The moss grows, on the trees in the woods up , eight, ten, feet.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's the way it is, was, there, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think, however, that's like February.
A:	Uh, I know it did it all February.
A:	And some people said to me, "Well, that's our wintertime."
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Well, I know you,  need to go.
B:	But,
A:	And I've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you, too.
B:	It was nice,  to talk to you.
A:	Thanks so much.
A:	Have a,
B:	I hope you enjoy,  North Carolina.
A:	Oh, thank you.
A:	And I hope you enjoy,  and get through that birthday party.
B:	Well, I hope,  I live through it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do,  too
B:	That's what I hope.
B:	Okay.
B:	Thanks a lot.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	All right,
A:	uh, how long have they been recycling there in Virginia?
B:	Um, actually quite a, a, a while.
B:	Um, I've lived here for six years
B:	and, can you hold on just a second?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh
B:	Hello.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I'm sorry
B:	I must have got the other line cut off.
B:	Uh, so, they've been doing that it for a while now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it,
B:	I live in an apartment
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my facilities ,
B:	there it is,
B:	hold on on
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Hello.
B:	Okay,
B:	sorry about that
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay,
A:	you're okay,
B:	Yeah.
A:	okay
B:	Uh, anyhow, they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only.
B:	Uh, I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at another public facility where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now,
A:	Have you, have you cycled, recycled plastic also?
B:	No,
B:	and that's what I, I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option.
A:	We, we have out here uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they had some bends, *sp: bins  around that we could find and put them in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but not all that many,
A:	it wasn't very well advertised
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but recently, uh, the refuse department has, has, uh, is working on getting a system going where we will actually have, uh, a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it, it should be good, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think it's a marvelous idea when you think of, uh, when I just think of the papers that I dump out
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean there just,
A:	it's such a
A:	I waste,
A:	I just hate to think about it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	now an additional thing is, uh,
B:	where I work they also have recycling there of, uh, all white paper and of, you know, cans also
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, I mean, a lot of people, you know, right at the vending machines,  they have receptacles that, you know,  you can just pop your cans in
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and near the,  Xerox machines they have places, you know, for your,  paper,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, I keep a little box at my desk, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just throw, as I'm using the white paper, you know, I just throw it right in there,
A:	Uh.
B:	and then, you know, they have someone that comes around and pick it up, you know, every afternoon which, you know, is an excellent idea,  at work because I know the amount paper they go through there
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's neat.
A:	Yeah.
B:	because,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about,  about it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	there's needs to be more public, uh,  service of, programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
B:	Yeah,
B:	I would agree with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there's,
B:	Right.
A:	I've seen a few things but not very much,  really
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I, I think that's a shame
A:	they need to, uh, do a little more,
A:	I'd like to know, for instance, when I, when they say, uh, plastic, all plastic, what kind of plastic,  can you put all together or,  is there some reason not to,
B:	Exactly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use,
A:	I don't know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I, I'd be glad to organize it,  if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I agree with you there,
B:	another thing that I like here which is,
B:	I do with,
B:	I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that, uh,
B:	their aluminum cans is for, uh, Children's Hospital, for a burn fund
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so all the monies are donated, you know,  for the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea,  there, you know, because the other,  public,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's great.
A:	Now that gives,  you a little bit of incentive there.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and before even at work,
B:	before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had everyone in my department recycling
B:	and, you know, I would have them drop,  right, drop their cans off in my office
A:	Saving them for you, uh.
B:	and then I would haul them, you know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's,  right.
B:	but,
A:	I think, I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it,  helping us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	That,
B:	there you go.
B:	That's for sure.
A:	But I, I think that's
A:	right I think they, there needs to be a little bit more in the area of, of, uh, advertisement,  and letting, public letting you understand,  more of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how you're it's done and,  what, what happens to it because I think that's, that would help a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and I'm sure, you know, in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, I've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling,  everywhere, you know, even at McDonald's,  you know, with their, their use of no,  foam containers anymore.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	I, I'm glad,  to see some of these things, I think.
B:	Right.
B:	I think, I think it is getting more, you know, advertisement.
A:	People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do,  and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and all these things that,
B:	Right.
A:	I think that's true.
A:	Well, I think,
A:	I'm that's about my, uh  some on recycling
B:	Yeah
A:	but I, I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, I did too.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	all right,
A:	bye now.
B:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye clicks hanging
A:	I have, uh,
A:	I, well, I used to have the opinion that there that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, uh, before, uh,
A:	simply because.
A:	The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, uh, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.
B:	Compile more statistics.
A:	That's right,
A:	and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.
B:	More especially where you are.
B:	Are you, in Washington D C or Washington state?
A:	Well, yeah.
A:	No,
A:	I am in, I am in Washington D C.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I was going to say,
A:	Actually it,
A:	you know, I do a lot of business here,
A:	and I come here quite often
A:	and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. Regardless of the racial makeup,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but it's, it's real, uh,
A:	there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they, uh,
B:	It just really grabs your attention.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It just makes the whole place seem like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess, uh, uh,
A:	when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, Bennett, I think his name was, became the drug czar, uh, for, uh, President Bush, he was going to focus on it, on this area and do something about it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I see that even he was met without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.
B:	What do you, what do you think is causing all this,
A:	Well,
B:	because, it seems that there
B:	even though
B:	crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, I, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.
A:	I have one theory,
A:	and it's brought to us by two things.
A:	One I, I believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, I am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,
A:	I am not even, I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey and, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled with a fight. You know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument.
A:	And, and then I, I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,
A:	so I think that particularly
A:	I, I was reading the other day about, uh, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the the highest,
A:	I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America uh, per capita.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was, I have not seen that,
B:	but, uh,
A:	I mean the Saturday night special stuff
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	That, that's what I think about it,
A:	that's some of the things I think about it,
A:	plus like drop I do not know,
A:	what are your views?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I tend to agree with you with, you know,
B:	it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, and along with that, you know,
B:	and then you start making a movie and it has no, there's no call for something violent,
B:	but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it
A:	well that's, that's, that's the impression I get, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I, and I imagine that it's, you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,
A:	people want to,
A:	it conditions people to it
A:	and, uh, you have to
A:	it has to be even, uh, magnified to to attract people's attention. I guess, to have them spend money on something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you become callous.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, I mean I, I, read now where we are, you know,
A:	women are young women are arrested fighting with knives over, over whatever. whatever reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young.
B:	Um.
A:	Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,
A:	but, that's what
A:	seems that those things happened did not happen in that manner before television.
A:	And I, I, I, I have to think that, that it has some influence on it.
A:	But,
B:	I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time
A:	Yeah.
B:	I do not know if you listen to him or not,
A:	No.
B:	he's on A M,
B:	but, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the,
B:	there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.
B:	For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids,
B:	and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".
B:	And people, I, I, I, I guess they confused discipline with punishment.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, just,
B:	it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.
B:	It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.
B:	And I disagree,
B:	and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	Well, I mean, I, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, uh, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, that, uh, there's so there's so much of a return from to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.
A:	And, and that is not emphasized.
A:	I recognize there's, there's over crowding problems
A:	and, and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that that's complicated the entire process.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What I also think that,
A:	I guess it's the reflection of the society where, where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, uh,
A:	you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you, where you live
A:	or. I do not mean attachment and responsibility,
A:	I guess I mean any sort of,
B:	Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.
B:	It's like, oh boy, I wish they would stop doing that.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	I, I do not know how that's,
A:	I do not think it's done by, uh,
A:	the changes come simply by statutory nature.
A:	I do not know what it really will take
B:	Um.
A:	And, I do not know if I have solutions, except, except to,
A:	you know, I am sort of a, a, an advocate of, of, uh, of letting people, of having free speech
A:	and I guess to curb, uh,
A:	television, uh, the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	However, there does seem to be a,
A:	right now in verbalizing,
A:	it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then how many,
A:	And the sacrifice is not that great.
B:	How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between, you know, what you see and how
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	I think, I think that's correct.
B:	And, yes
B:	but, you know, as soon as you start, uh,
A:	Well, Texas has, uh, Texas has, uh, has always struck me,
A:	I mean I, I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, uh, uh, short business stints.
A:	And it seems to me they are a pretty, pretty tough law and order state,
A:	but that's a,
A:	but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.
A:	Just citing that, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, unfortunately you have got a lot of the, uh,
B:	some, well a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close, to the border with Mexico,
A:	Yeah.
B:	we have got a lot of that influence.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes,
A:	I talked with, um, I talked with people from Richardson and Plano
A:	and, uh, the first three days,
A:	and then yesterday I talked with someone with, from Pennsylvania,
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	because,
A:	it's the,
B:	I've only made,
B:	this is only my third call.
A:	Oh.
B:	I, I tried to make calls two different days
B:	and I couldn't get through.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	Sometimes I just
A:	I'm, in,
A:	it just takes a very long time
A:	so,
B:	Does it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've been trying to, you know, do that,
B:	and, and sometimes I just can't wait that long,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	so I just hang up. Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again.
A:	Well.
A:	This is hilarious
B:	But I knew as soon as I heard your voice,
B:	I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy Kester
A:	Oh. Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	I, um, gosh, I can't even think.
B:	I haven't read any,
B:	and you're such a reader, I know that
B:	and I,
A:	Well, I don't read all that much for enjoyment.
A:	I mean, I read a lot for school,
A:	but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
B:	Yeah.
B:	The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think. Um, or something like that.
A:	Um.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it was, it was kind of,
B:	I really didn't like it at all.
A:	Huh.
B:	It was, it was written back in the early eighties.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome of the, um,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing.
A:	Interesting.
B:	It was really an interesting,
B:	because I, I right away looked at when it was copyrighted. Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written. And, um, you know, a lot of hanky-panky,  going on.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.
B:	That's right.
A:	And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.
A:	I was always,  just more aware of her you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	for her young people, her books. *one utt?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and she's more famous for that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but she has been writing for adults also,
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,  and see what it was like.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was very, um,
B:	the style was very conversational.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You know how that is,
B:	and um,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything printed, in print.
B:	Yeah,
B:	she has,
B:	because I, I remember seeing a new book by her that was out,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think it was a, it was an adult book.
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	So anyway,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that's the last thing I, I've read,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, um,
A:	Well, it's,
A:	I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't,
A:	let's see, I think I read, oh,
A:	when I was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I went to my mother's,
A:	I read a book that I have, should have read when I was probably in high school.
A:	I read, um, JANE EYRE.
B:	I,
A:	No,
A:	wait a minute,
A:	wait a minute,
A:	wait a minute.
A:	JANE EYRE?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	no,
A:	no,
A:	it wasn't JANE EYRE.
B:	WUTHERING HEIGHTS?
A:	No,
A:	it was, um, uh, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,  by Jane Austen.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	by Jane Austen,
B:	yes.
A:	That's what it was,
A:	yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist,
A:	and she really was good.
A:	I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,  intricately
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, and, you know, I just,
A:	but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,  or had to write it, read it in high school or college,
B:	but I don't remember it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and I got her the, I got her someone,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.
A:	Oh, how interesting.
B:	You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And so I got that for her,
B:	and she loved doing that.
A:	Oh, I'll bet,
A:	yeah.
B:	But I remember that was the book.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,
A:	Right
A:	I wouldn't be,  surprised,
B:	I'm just going to have to put it, in the car sometimes and listen to it.
A:	yeah.
A:	Sure.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But, um,
A:	Well, I read that,
A:	and then I'm trying to think, um,
A:	usually I try to, to find something long that,  I'm going to,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	when
A:	if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's what I do too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.
A:	I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.
A:	Actually, it's for school,
A:	but it's for, um,
A:	there's a, a literary
A:	well, not a literary journal,
A:	it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.
A:	The first issue doesn't come out until next year,
A:	but, um,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I'm doing some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,
B:	Oh, how neat.
A:	and I've,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's really neat because these are brand new books
A:	and I,  just got a, I got a, this one,
B:	Oh, great.
A:	um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,  and religion and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach,
A:	and it's a, a, a biography,  that is really interesting,
B:	Oh, great.
B:	Oh, that's fascinating.
A:	I mean, it, it's fascinating,
A:	it really is.
B:	Oh.
A:	Um, but it's so long,
A:	I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing,
A:	but I think,  eventually I'll go back to it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it's,  it was written,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,
A:	so it's a brand new book.
B:	Oh, it's a brand new book.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that, that would be wonderful  to read something like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some,  aspects of of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they just went from generation,  probably to generation,  just with these, with these all passing it from one to the other.
A:	Yeah.
A:	that's right.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	and, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	it was just really interesting,
A:	if that's, you know, that's kind of what,
A:	but I have to
A:	not only am, am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board
A:	so,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not,
A:	but But at least I,  can tell them what I think,
B:	Wow, that's rough.
B:	That's real rough.
A:	so, um,  it's real interesting.
B:	Yeah.  Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine *sd that was similar to that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do in small colleges,
A:	Yes
A:	Yeah,
B:	but, um,
A:	that it,
A:	you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,  like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	right,
A:	uh-huh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.
A:	That's one way,
A:	it's really good public relations for small schools,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I think so
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing,
A:	and so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.
B:	Oh.
B:	Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,
A:	Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,  in the French and then has been translated into English by,  various people.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And the translations are all so different from one another.
B:	All different.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	So it's multiple translations of single works
A:	and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um,
A:	my work, is just kind of compiling,  all that for him.
B:	Gosh.
A:	So,
B:	That's great.
A:	It's real interesting.  There are days when I would be prefer ,  really doing that
B:	Boy, you really lift me up to a different,
B:	I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,  cleaning the stove
B:	and,
B:	You know, I'm   I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.
B:	That would be nice.
A:	I don't know if I've told you,
A:	but, um, this is not on the subject,
B:	What do you think about it?
A:	Well, I, I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately, that I think there are some occupations that they should, such as the health field, the transportation field, uh,
A:	they're already doing it in the armed forces, where they handle weapons and so forth, uh,
A:	they do it to prisoners
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, I, I, uh, I, I, I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions,
A:	and I think if, if, uh, an employer feels that he wants to, to drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed there
A:	That was,
A:	you know, I would not mind it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else, you know harm or injury, absolutely.
A:	Right.
B:	And I don't have a problem at all with employers, uh, testing in the hiring process,
B:	but I, I, I don't, I don't have a problem with them too much, testing even after the fact,
B:	but I do a little bit where it, where it wouldn't hurt anybody.
B:	I don't know,
B:	sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	But,
A:	unless an employer has a reason to believe that his, uh, the work competency of, of the employee is, is hurting the business.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right
A:	I mean maybe it's, uh,
B:	and then it's not a problem.
A:	Number one because generally if, if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft
B:	Yeah.
A:	and as an employer, I would think that would be,
A:	and the first,
A:	it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost.
B:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	There's no way.
A:	But, but my concern is, uh, school bus drivers.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	the train drivers,
A:	Um, I'm not even,
A:	I'm in education,
A:	I'm not even opposed to it for that.
A:	Uh, I'm concerned in the medical field.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too because I consider that a drug.
B:	I wish they would.
B:	I wish they would,
B:	and that, I think, is even probably more widely abused by, you know, the masses than, than drugs, so to speak.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So.
A:	But when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus, or a train, um
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	And,
A:	and it doesn't take that long.
A:	They don't have to be totally roaring drunk
B:	No.
A:	just a little off on their timing could, could mean life.
B:	Just, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and,
B:	Now T I has the random testing policy
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and, and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a, in a pool
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I've already been tested once when I was hired and, and once since they initiated this random testing program.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But I work with one girl who was tested, her name got, got randomly selected three times in six months
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when there's no, you know, there's no reason to suspect someone, you know.
A:	Control.
B:	That, that's getting a little bit,
B:	that's enough to make anybody paranoid
A:	Right.
A:	Well, as long as you accept that it is a random, a random testing uh, you know, to, to alleviate,
B:	Yeah.
A:	that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me.
B:	Right.
A:	If,
A:	it's almost like being selected for jury duty
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel,
A:	that's, that's just the way it is.
B:	Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it.
A:	I would, I would rather have it that way, to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because I, I think there's, when you let other employees turn in people,
B:	Oh, absolutely,
B:	There are so many people with, with their petty axes to grind
A:	Right.
B:	it could really get out of hand.
A:	Right.
A:	So, I, I, I would really rather know, however,
A:	there's got to be some backup to say that
A:	if, if somebody does observe you at, say at a party, uh, using drugs I would think that it would be their obligation to report that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	To report it,
B:	and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe anonymously or something because I, I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol,
A:	Personnel, or something,
A:	Right.
B:	I'd just I'd feel really uncomfortable.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	I don't know what kind of work you do,
A:	but there, there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have, we have a lot of people who work on the line.
B:	I'm in accounting,
B:	so it wouldn't,
B:	you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something,
A:	Right.
B:	but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So.
A:	It's, it's,
A:	I, I just think employers have to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that goes on, I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at Because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,
B:	Put at risk.
B:	I agree totally.
A:	and, and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, uh, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.
B:	And in the long run, we're all paying for that
A:	Right.
B:	so it, I mean, it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that.
A:	Right.
B:	I, I was trying to remember, there was a court case, uh, here where I live, just a few months ago.
B:	The city workers, they wanted to, um,
B:	the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
A:	Uh.
B:	and the city workers, uh, took them to court to protest, saying that it invaded their, I guess, first the, the search and seizure amendment
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and it's still tied up in the legal channels.
B:	They haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not.
A:	Huh.
B:	So I'm curious especially since T I a local, you know, employer is also already doing it, seeing what they'll say about it especially since,
A:	To see how that's,
A:	Is it, is it, uh, just a small group of the employees that are concerned?
B:	Well, it's the whole, it's the whole city,
B:	seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it.
A:	They, they just don't want to be drug tested.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	You know, we've never, my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, my husband's retired from I R S agents.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	However, this isn't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug,
B:	Right.
A:	and so, we, we, in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's the way I looked at it.
B:	If I had something to hide, it's one thing,
B:	but I'm,
B:	you know, you know you don't,
B:	so it's not as big a deal,
B:	and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something else.
A:	Right.
A:	And, and then they say, well, if you give them the right to do this, then they're going to take some other right away from you,
A:	but I, I
B:	I don't believe that.
A:	I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything,
A:	and, of course, the big deal, one of the big deals now, too, is to, that when you, come into a company, as you sign a paper saying that I will go take a,
A:	Okay.
A:	I'll let you start.
A:	Do you all keep a budget,
A:	and how do you hold to yours?
B:	No,
B:	I, I never keep a budget.
B:	My budget or philosophy, I guess, is spend as little as possible.
A:	Well, that's, that's good
B:	And, uh and it's, it's sort of always worked.
A:	Especially for these times.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but that depends, you know, on the individual if they can I guess have self-control.
A:	Well, that's a lot of it.
A:	Uh, I know we tried several different ways.
A:	One time we tried something that really worked
A:	but we didn't keep it up.
A:	I passed it on to a friend
A:	and she won't quit doing it.
A:	She loves it
A:	and that was the envelope system. Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that.
A:	So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera.
A:	And then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form, uh, causes you to realize how much is left.
A:	And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope, what she's buying.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then at the end of the, of the period, pay period, if she has any left, that much is for fun or entertainment.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they kind of work it that way.
A:	We tried for a while
A:	and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the, of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about.
B:	Yes.
A:	And those are the ones that will kill you.
A:	You know, the the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I, I couldn't probably be bothered doing that every month,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and and ever since,
A:	That's what I mean.
A:	It was a hassle
B:	uh, well, we've been married almost thirty years now
B:	but, uh, my husband got paid once a month.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So you learn to get,
A:	That's, that's kind of hard
B:	Right.
B:	You learn to get through, you know, to the end of the month
B:	and, uh,
A:	But do you sort of self budget even,
A:	I mean, you wouldn't like on payday think, boy, I can go do this and that and this and that.
A:	You kind of think this is got to
B:	No.
A:	you kind of divide it in fourths in a way, don't you?
B:	No.
B:	Because if you charge things, uh, you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month, when you get paid,
A:	Right.
B:	or you get paid the last day or next to the last day.
A:	Right.
B:	You pay all your bills
B:	and there isn't anything left to spend anyway.
A:	Well, that's true.
A:	What we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely.
A:	And we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	we, we tried to, to, to,
A:	Oh.
B:	or we are paying them off now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're not there yet.
B:	Uh, there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you just sort of had to watch what you put in, because you hate to pay those finance charges, when you see how much it is.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	And for most of, uh,
B:	I mean I'm a substitute teacher,
B:	and I've only substituted, I guess, for the last fifteen years,
A:	Huh.
B:	so there's only been really one working.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	same here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it, it works for me
B:	but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people.
A:	Well, I could say it's kind of,
A:	you know, that's, that's good.
A:	You you probably have a little extra than you have to have, to,
A:	you know what I'm saying?
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so, that, that's the difference there where sometimes like I know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday, then I think if we could really budget,
A:	we tried one
A:	I know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years, we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for, to see how much was going to be left,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that was a real eye opener. Uh-huh. *slash error should be 'b'
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, it is when you do it that way.
A:	But to, to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out.
A:	So it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun.
A:	This is how much you're going to spend
A:	It's kind of hard.
B:	Well, we, we eat out a good deal at this point.
A:	Do you?
B:	I, I started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved, all that money so because I knew that you couldn't, you know, spending, five thousand dollars on a vacation, or whatever.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right
A:	Right.
B:	We were going to go for ten weeks, uh, in nineteen eighty
A:	Oh.
B:	so I started, working in nineteen eighty-seven and just saved, for three years.
A:	How nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But the,
B:	what minuscule amount I made
B:	but, that way you just didn't put it on your credit card,
A:	Well, that's,
B:	and, and it was paid for.
A:	and it made a big,
A:	and you enjoyed it better probably.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yeah, .
B:	And so I think that that's difficult for most people,
B:	but then my father was,  very Scotch
A:	I think so too.
B:	and, you know, you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to. Um,
A:	So if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale, you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you?
B:	Yes.
A:	That's, that's excellent.
A:	That's what I'm working toward.
A:	I think you're probably much ahead of me there
A:	and I'm working on it.
B:	And I never worried about saving money because we just, we're in the savings plan at work
B:	and they took it out
B:	so,
A:	Same here,
A:	same here.
B:	I, uh,
A:	And I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know?
B:	Well, we never had too much of that
A:	Yeah.
B:	but then we never had any really emergencies that, uh,
A:	That came up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we didn't buy really new or expensive cars.
B:	I think the most, my, we're looking at cars now, uh, we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they were mainly used cars.
A:	Well, that's the best thing to do.
A:	My husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so,
A:	So,
B:	you know, we've been rather rather frugal in that.  In that respect.
A:	Rather frugal.
A:	Well, that's, that's going to payoff on retirement.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Well, it, uh,
A:	I guess we've completed,
A:	do you think we've been here to
B:	Well, each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please, uh,
A:	How would you go about organizing a family reunion?
B:	Well,
B:	for,
B:	I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.
B:	So whenever I think of family reunions,
B:	my family, like, got together almost every week.
A:	Oh, gee.
B:	And there would be like thirty people.
B:	So people talk about, you know, big family reunions
B:	and I think, like
B:	I have a friend who just went to, like, Wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	And I,
B:	so I mean, how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because I, since I came from,
B:	my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers
B:	and my mother has four brothers and two sisters.
B:	So I
B:	both of my parents had big families,
B:	and we always we always got together, just always.
B:	Now it's different because I live here
B:	and I,
B:	you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can
B:	but it's real different.
A:	Yes.
B:	And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.
A:	With all of you living so close together.
B:	Right.
B:	I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's
B:	and, you know, like I said there would be thirty, you know, thirty people,
B:	and everyone would just bring things
B:	and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.
A:	Oh.
B:	And
A:	Well, I come from a very small family.
A:	And we planned a family reunion this spring. Uh, where we are from Texas
A:	and my family is from Ohio
A:	and we met in Florida.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.
A:	So that's all the family,
A:	so planning our family reunion was very easy you know .
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess so.
B:	It really sounds like it was fun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we had a wonderful
A:	Well, I almost forgot the topic,
A:	I was waiting so long for, uh, for it to find somebody. Um,
B:	It's on your favorite T V shows and why.
A:	Right,
A:	well, so what is your favorite T V show?
B:	Uh, MAJOR DAD.
A:	Oh, you like that one?
B:	I, I love it,
B:	I think it promotes good family values,
B:	and it's funny.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I've never really watched that one.
A:	You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
B:	That's
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, you know, there's, so there's only a few that I, that I like to watch routinely.
B:	What kind do you like to watch?
A:	Probably my favorite is, um, oh,
A:	well, I like shows like GROWING PAINS
A:	and, uh, what's the other one now, they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night,
A:	so I don't get to watch it very much.
B:	WONDER YEARS?
A:	WONDER YEARS,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's my favorite. Uh,
B:	I like both of those real much also.
B:	I, I think basically, they same thing, they promote family values.
A:	Yeah.
A:	WONDER YEARS,
A:	I, I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.
A:	I guess I can really relate to it,
A:	and, uh, it's just a real cute show
A:	Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, uh, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.
B:	I do, too.
B:	I, I don't like it, uh, lot of the shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, uh, oh, GOLDEN GIRLS
B:	and, some of them tend to get so risque,
B:	and when you have children uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	and, uh, that's one of the reasons,
B:	I mean, if you want to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	my wife really likes that show,
B:	yeah,
B:	which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, um
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, they, they go after, well,
B:	they,
B:	like I said, the risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to watch.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, there was,
A:	but there's a sense of I guess, purity in the show,
A:	like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS
B:	Yes.
A:	but, uh, you know, Richie always used to be so, you know, just so honest and pure I guess,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and when he left the show, you know, that, it seemed to be missing that part of it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I never did like it after that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, I don't know,
A:	I, I say, see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch.
A:	There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree.
B:	Uh, do you like the sports programming?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent.
B:	I'm,
B:	our whole house is baseball fans
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we enjoy that,
B:	and, uh
A:	So you're going to watch a game tonight?
B:	oh yeah,
B:	oh, yeah
A:	So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?
B:	Uh, probably the Pirates,
B:	but only because of Steve Bushel, I guess
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	otherwise I really don't care that much,
B:	but, uh, you know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him,
B:	and, uh, I'd like to see him do well, like all the way to the bank I guess
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's a nice guy.
A:	I take it you live in the Dallas area.
A:	Do you live in the Dallas area?
B:	Live in, live in Plano.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I live in Garland,
A:	and, yeah,
A:	I, I like Steve Bushel,
A:	but I don't really like the Pirates.
A:	I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all,
A:	they, you know, they they've come from so far down,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really would like to see them do well.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's, uh,
B:	so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do
A:	Yeah,
A:	one, one year they,
A:	maybe they'll make it, I don't know
B:	Right.
A:	so, but, uh, yeah,
A:	I like sports programming quite a bit,
A:	but, uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the,
A:	and, you know, that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true,
A:	we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago,
A:	and her daughter was talking about birth control, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time,
A:	and, you know, she's only seven years old,
A:	so,
B:	Well, it's,
B:	so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in,
B:	and and, uh, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm an adult
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I have adult tastes now,
B:	but I don't need that
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	uh, I, I like things that, uh, are, are wholesome, I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that, that seems to be more our values, too,
A:	like the WONDER YEARS, I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers,
A:	you know, or, and you can kind of relate to it you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know,
A:	that's,
A:	I enjoy that a lot
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	but, uh, you know, I agree with you,
A:	the,
A:	and it's funny because the shows,
A:	like a lot of them that used to be considered risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they maintained,
A:	people would watch them because
A:	there was that, uh, you know, there was really the period that was going on there,
A:	I mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls,
A:	but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way,
B:	Okay,
B:	I'm ready.
A:	Okay,
A:	so we're going to talk about, uh, what kind of clothes we wear while we work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you work for T I?
B:	No,
B:	I work at home
A:	Oh, you do,
A:	well, you're like me then
A:	I stay home also.
B:	Do you have children?
A:	Yes,
A:	I have two, a seven year old and three and a half year old.
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	How about you?
B:	I have four girls
A:	Oh.
B:	they're nine and five and three and a newborn.
A:	Oh, my, you are busy
B:	Yes,
A:	and they're all girls,
A:	I have two girls,
A:	so, all girls around here
B:	Girls are nice, aren't they?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh, really sweet.
B:	Anyway, as far as clothing goes, um, my wardrobe changes all the time, depending on my size
A:	That's how I am too.
B:	We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes, clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet or you're on your way up from regular size
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's funny.
B:	and they're all in boxes or bags,
B:	and they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time, though,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't, uh, get a whole lot new right now,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know that's kind of how I am.
A:	I said, who ever I talk to is going to be board, because when it's summer time, I'm wearing shorts,
A:	and when it's cold, I'm wearing sweat pants, and most of, unless I'm going to something special that my daughter's doing, or something like that,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I like jeans a lot.
A:	Well, that's, that's good.
A:	I used to wear jeans all the time until after I had kids,
A:	and now nothing seems to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places,
A:	so
B:	Oh, and it's, it's frustrating,
B:	I just, I find I have to get the right kinds, though, or it's not comfortable
A:	Yeah.
B:	they,
B:	it, it works best if they have pleats in the front
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	and, uh, they have to,
B:	my waist is kind of small compared to the hips,
B:	so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know what you mean.
A:	Well,
B:	But, um, but I,
B:	when I was, I was pregnant through the summer this time and I wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right.
B:	but, uh,
A:	One of my daughters was born in June,
A:	and I remember, I wore sundresses and, you know, just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And I had one that was born in December,
A:	so, um, it was a little bit, because it was a real warm winter
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so even, even into like November and December I was still wearing the short sleeve dresses,
A:	course I'm always hot when I'm pregnant, too,
A:	so
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	I, I didn't really need warm clothes
A:	but I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new, uh, units outfits, you know, that are just knit,
B:	Oh, I haven't tried those,
A:	Oh, they are so comfortable.
B:	Huh.
A:	It's, it's just, um, you know, a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's just great because you can put, you know, you can decorate them up, or dress them up, if you want,
B:	Yeah.
A:	or you can just wear them with, you know, tennis shoes if you want.
A:	So they're really nice
A:	and I've enjoyed wearing those
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I,
B:	I don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here
B:	but I sure never wear them
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I don't either,
A:	if we, if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I worked part time when my oldest was a baby
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I had to wear a dress every day,
A:	and and it was a little bit hard to, uh, wind down,
B:	I'm watching, Janice,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I would, I would have to drive six thirty five home
A:	and I would be burning up, like in the summer time
B:	Oh.
A:	by the time I got home I was like, Oh, I've got to get out of these clothes
B:	I, I remember that from when I was,
B:	I worked way before I was married, even,
B:	but offices, they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	you've got to have something to add to it or something
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if you can,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then when you drive home, like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas,
B:	You burn up,
A:	uh-huh
B:	Yeah.
A:	because I always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was afraid I'd make the car overheat.
B:	It's hard on the car.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so I would roll my windows down,
A:	it was still a hundred degrees
B:	Oh.
A:	and I would just be sweltering hot by the time I picked my daughter up,
A:	and um, I had a friend who used to take shorts to work,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes
B:	Oh, that's funny,
A:	and I thought, that's probably a good idea because you really
B:	Yeah
B:	at least something cooler,
A:	yeah,
A:	because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned, which I don't have any of.
B:	That's true,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't have to worry a whole lot about that.
A:	No,
A:	when you have children, you don't,
A:	um, even when I go to church I have to have something I can just throw in the washer when I'm through.
B:	That's right,
B:	something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on, too
A:	I know it.
B:	I've always been a creature of comfort, too
A:	Me, too.
B:	if it's not comfortable, forget it.
A:	I know,
A:	that's how I am, too,
B:	Wool was never comfortable to me.
A:	Right,
A:	me neither,
A:	I have,
A:	Okay.
A:	Where do you enjoy dining out?
B:	Oh, I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.
A:	Yes,
A:	do you have children?
B:	Uh, we have four,
B:	but most of them are gone now
A:	Uh.
B:	so there, there might be,
B:	but we were taking, you know, uh, four, five and six people out
A:	Yeah,
A:	that makes a difference, doesn't it.
B:	Yes.
A:	What area of the country do you live in?
B:	I'm in Texas.
A:	Yes,
A:	I am, too.
A:	But,
B:	And we we lived in Ohio prior to this.
A:	I did, too.
A:	I'm from the Dayton area.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, but I look for service even at the quickie places type things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong
A:	That's right.
B:	and then you're stuck
B:	and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave
A:	Yes.
B:	so I really don't like the drive-thrus that much.
B:	I, I like to go and eat there.
B:	But I would say service, uh, atmosphere, and whether the food is good,
B:	and on going out, I like steaks.
B:	So, we try to hit those places when we can.
A:	When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids,
A:	and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then that way they can get their burgers and fries
A:	and we can have a salad bar
B:	Yeah.
A:	so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's, because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens,
B:	and, in, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main
A:	Right,
A:	that's right,
B:	That's what you find,
B:	right,
A:	I know.
B:	My husband likes, uh, Dairy Queens.
B:	He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs, I guess,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so he's a fan of, of Dairy Queen,
B:	and, and we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although I'm not that excited about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place
B:	but yet I hate to cook food at home
A:	Oh.
B:	so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	Or we eat junk food at home
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, now my
A:	Well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places?
B:	Oh, we'll go to them all.
B:	We sort of take turns.
B:	And we, uh
B:	I sort of favor the ones,
B:	if I have a coupon we can go there
B:	and if not we can't, because it's cheaper
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so mine is, monetarily, I guess strongly monetarily based.
B:	Uh, we'll go get pizza and, uh, at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's.
A:	Oh, we are Little Caesar fans here
B:	Right.
A:	that's where we always go,
B:	But it's just a lot cheaper than, than Domino's,
B:	so that's.
B:	We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say.
A:	Yes,
A:	we like Grandy's, too.
B:	McDonald's, uh, we've sort of been off of that for a while
B:	and no particular reason,
B:	and I,
B:	maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there
B:	and she never wanted us to show up there
A:	Oh.
B:	so, I don't, we don't go there that much.
A:	Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out, or a big meal?
B:	A nice meal, oh,
A:	Where do you go for steaks?
B:	It's usually when we're out of town
A:	Oh.
B:	and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so it's really not in town.
A:	Oh.
A:	You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line?
B:	No.
A:	That's where we go to get steaks
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they have a teriyaki steak there,
A:	and when we have something to celebrate, we head to Houston's.
A:	They don't take reservations,
A:	and you wind up waiting about an hour
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but the food is good,
A:	and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink, unless you get there at five o'clock,
A:	then you can go right through.
B:	Right.
A:	But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks,
A:	so, that's our nice place to go.
A:	We don't usually take the kids when we go there,
B:	But well, we don't go out that much,
B:	I well, I guess we do go out without kids.
B:	We're usually picking things up quickly,
B:	though we just don't dwell on food too much,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places
A:	Right,
A:	That's right.
B:	so, it doesn't really matter to him.
B:	He'd probably just like to stay home. Well, I think, I, I never have liked to cook food,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the way with my husband.
A:	He's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends,
A:	and I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere,
A:	so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.
B:	but I think it all began eating out when we had, uh, the boys in, in different, uh, baseball on baseball
A:	Right.
B:	it was mainly baseball teams
A:	Yes.
B:	and my husband would coach,
B:	so we were never home at the same time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm not one that's going to fix, you know, the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there.
A:	Right.
B:	or you go you know you fend for yourself.
A:	Yep.
B:	You go somewhere else.
A:	Well, the types of vacations that I usually take,
A:	I usually come back more tired after my vacation, then I do, you know, before I take it.
A:	Um, I need to definitely take a vacation where all, all I do is rest.
A:	And I guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home.
B:	Oh
A:	But, um, the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida.
A:	I enjoy the beach.
B:	Oh, I am, after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach.
A:	Antibeach.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	We went to, uh, Cape Hatteras.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, we, we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland,
B:	and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, the, the waves were huge.
B:	I've never quite seen waves like this one
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I was standing in water not more than, in barely above my ankles
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.
A:	Right.
B:	And I was standing there talking to my daughter
B:	and this really big wave came and totally threw me,
B:	and one foot did not come out of the sand,
B:	and it tore the ligaments in my knee
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm never going to another beach again, ever.
B:	I'm
A:	You might be like I am.
A:	I enjoy, I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas,
A:	but I really don't like to get in the water, the ocean.
A:	I prefer a swimming pool
B:	Well, I, I love to go and play around.
B:	At least I always did but although actually, my, I like the mountains.
B:	I, uh, I don't really like hot weather
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that's my biggest gripe about living here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I basically, don't want to go to a hot place on vacation
A:	Right.
A:	I can understand that.
B:	Oh.
B:	I, my dream vacation is Alaska.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	This is just someplace I've always wanted to go
A:	That would be nice.
B:	and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know I've taken several vacations to Colorado,
A:	and I used to live in Colorado, oh, sometime ago for a couple of years,
A:	and I really enjoyed that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'd, I'd like that.
B:	Uh, I haven't been to Yellowstone for a long, long time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I would, uh, we've been talking about going there next summer
B:	Uh, I don't know we'll have to, to,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've never been up to the Yellowstone area.
A:	So,
B:	It's been a long time.
B:	But you know, it seems when your family is, is different places, a lot of trips involved going to visit
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
A:	You got that.
B:	Oh, I'm,
B:	we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we've got one of our, our kids lives out on the east coast
B:	and so we have to, you know, go to those.
A:	Well, you have, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then.
B:	Well, I know
B:	but I'm tired of them
A:	Right.
B:	I want to go someplace different up there.
A:	That's right.
B:	Uh, my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, uh, money be no object. You know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where I want to, rent a car if I want to. Uh, you know, just the, really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, um, you know, again we, we fit that in there or not.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, that, that's what I, um, you know, that's what I would like to do.
B:	I have no interest, for example, in taking a cruise.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling.
A:	It would be sort of,
A:	I feel like it would be confining.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know I would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just, uh,
B:	that, that does absolutely nothing for me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I don't know
B:	I can say that I think my, my favorite spots are still to go, to go where there's mountains and, and a lot of trees and, and wildlife to view
B:	and, and, uh, I like that kind of stuff.
B:	I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery
A:	Yes.
A:	I, I agree.
A:	I can, I can do that too,
A:	and, uh, you know, I think if I had, if I had the money, I would probably go to Europe every year.
A:	Because, you know, I think that they have, they have it all over there in just a few tiny, two, two miles.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, there's mountains
A:	and there's beaches
A:	and it's all right there.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I, I guess I've never really thought about it that way.
B:	Our, uh,
B:	we have a daughter who's almost thirteen
B:	but she's, uh a very picky eater
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and our, our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death if we, you know, we took her into the country
A:	Oh.
B:	so So, but I, I would like if, you know it was anywhere in the world to go, I guess, even though it's hot,
A:	Right.
B:	I would like to go to Africa.
A:	Real excited when I heard this.
A:	So far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment
A:	so football, I love this.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	This is great.
A:	Well, we're from Colorado
A:	so we're Bronco fans
A:	And, um, we just moved here two years ago
A:	and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here
A:	and they lost again.
A:	That was pretty pitiful,
A:	but they seem to be doing pretty good this year.
B:	Well, I was from Illinois originally,
B:	and I grew up a Bear fan.
B:	And, uh, then we moved here
B:	even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger Staubach .
B:	And we kind of got spoiled.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We expected it to continue forever.
B:	I think they're doing pretty well this year though.
A:	Well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year?
B:	I think two.
A:	Two.
B:	I know they lost, yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But they're not doing bad.
A:	People are pretty surprised that they, I mean they beat the Giants.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and wasn't that fun.
B:	I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me,
B:	and I must say I attracted a lot of attention.
A:	I bet
B:	People running up saying, oh, what's the score, what's the score?
A:	Oh, boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
B:	That's right
B:	and that's exactly what they said, to sound like a my wife dragged me away from the television.
A:	Yep.
B:	You know, but I wasn't,
B:	I had forgotten
B:	or I probably wouldn't have been there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I am, I'm a big football fan.
A:	I never
A:	my father was a football fan my whole life
A:	and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff
A:	and I just hated it.
A:	And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football
A:	and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend.
A:	I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football.
A:	So,
B:	That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think.
A:	Yep.
B:	It was, uh, you know,
B:	it's easier to join them than fight them.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I do.
A:	I just, I love it.
A:	It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport.
A:	And, uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet.
A:	We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, it takes a little brainwashing first.
A:	Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's even harder.
A:	But,
B:	Are you, uh, transit usually?
B:	I mean do you stay not in one place too long?
A:	No,
A:	we're just,
A:	this is only the second place we've lived.
A:	We've only been married for five and a half years.
A:	And, uh, we have two small children,
A:	and he had a, uh, just got transferred here to E-Systems,
A:	so.
B:	Well, it will take you a little while
B:	but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver.
A:	Oh.
A:	Well, I tell you this,
A:	the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, you know,
A:	and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, you know, there's snow
A:	and it's an adventure
A:	And here, yeah you've just got to drive down to the, to the stadium
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
A:	Yes.
B:	But, uh, Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.
A:	Well, he's from here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right, you know
B:	he was one of ours, one of our boys.
A:	That's what I hear.
B:	So we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.
A:	Which is rare.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Which is good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I,
A:	you know, it's funny
A:	in, in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last, I don't know, five or six years whatever it's been. Um, they have these songs on the radio.
A:	They take popular songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the Broncos and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they had,
A:	I was just thinking about one the other day.
A:	Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, um,
A:	but they did the Johnny Angel.
A:	They did Johnny Elway to that.
B:	Johnny Elway.
A:	And, and I was trying to get my son to sing that.
A:	My husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song
A:	But, they, they do a lot of fun things.
A:	I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it.
A:	Because you know there's just,
B:	Well, there is so much about it to like.
A:	It's exciting.
B:	You know it's so exciting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs,
B:	and we all ran out and bought the records,
B:	and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they
A:	I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado.
A:	Because, uh, I, I think about that a lot.
A:	But, you know, when I first moved here was when they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this.
A:	This interstate seventy-five song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That was kind of a funny song
A:	but they sure do,
A:	it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here.
A:	Even when they were losing pitifully, you know, people still support them.
A:	We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs,
A:	we love the
A:	Are, are we paying too much in taxes,
A:	and are we getting what we pay for?
A:	What's your opinion?
B:	Well, it's kind of a broad subject, uh,
B:	I, I think there are some areas where we, where we, uh, pretty well, you know, get our money's worth,
B:	but I, I also think there are a lot of areas especially in, uh, big government, federal government, uh, where we're short changed. Uh, lot of money spent for, uh, things that are not used
B:	and, uh, I was, I was in the Air Force
B:	and I was at, there were, there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste.
B:	It was just sitting and rusting
B:	and, you know, and
A:	Okay.
A:	I, I tend to agree with you.
A:	When it comes to government spending, there are so many studies done that don't mean anything
B:	Yeah.
A:	but we'll spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist,
A:	but, it could be put to more practical use.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I, I think that, uh, it's a, a tone of our times that politicians, uh, are into themselves more than they are into, you know, doing something worthwhile for the people they represent, which is really unfortunate.
A:	That is true.
A:	I agree with you in that area.
A:	Uh, I have a tendency to,
A:	I'm in, from Texas
A:	and I read, you know, how our politicians voted each week in the paper.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's, you know, it's interesting how the votes vary
A:	and what they ran on in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or Congress, whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And don't really respond to, uh, people who write them and call them
B:	and, uh, you know, unless they're in the limelight and under pressure
B:	So,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think we get short changed on that.
A:	Right,
A:	that's very true.
A:	What, what state do you live in?
B:	Texas.
A:	Okay.
B:	That's,
A:	What do you think about Robin Hood?
B:	Well I work for school district
B:	and, uh, it's, it has hurt us a lot.
B:	Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to equalize education opportunities.
B:	But, uh, you know, our, we, we tend to think, I think, especially big government, tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it.
B:	And I don't, you know,
B:	that's just not true.
B:	I don't think the, you know, I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.
B:	Uh, I think there are, there are too many things that money can't uh, that, that money can't buy that, that are important as far as education is concerned.
A:	That's true.
A:	What school district do you work for?
B:	Richardson.
A:	Okay.
A:	I work for Plano.
B:	Oh.
B:	Great,
A:	So, we're comparable.
B:	Yeah.
A:	As a matter of fact, I just paid my Richardson taxes because I live in Richardson and supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly, I think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think we've, uh, Yeah, we have got it on the line don't we.
A:	Our taxes went up tremendously.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it's not going to get any better.
B:	you know, I mean, it's going up and up and up.
B:	Uh, I used to live in the Plano school district,
B:	and, uh, there was a, an organization, a taxpayers organization that, uh, finally communicated the message to the, I think to the people in Plano that, you know, we didn't want our taxes raised.
A:	Yes,
A:	I remember there was about four, five years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
B:	But, this, you know, this, uh,
B:	I think living in Richardson, we're kind of spoiled because I think we get, we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned, I think than probably any, any city in the country.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the the administrators' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers.
B:	Is that incredible?
B:	That's, that's the biggest mess I've ever heard of.
B:	You know, how can you, how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you, you know, if you have to lay people off?
A:	Right.
A:	But, you know, I'm not going to complain because Plano got, we all got a pay raise this year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You all got a pay raise this year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is that correct?
B:	Well, yeah, I think the teachers uh, did,
B:	and I don't know about administrators.
B:	I, I'm semiretired
B:	and I was, I was an administrator,
B:	so I, you know, I don't get a raise anymore.
B:	I just, I, I work part-time and just get, uh, you know,
A:	Okay
B:	my pay doesn't change.
A:	Are you on the early retirement?
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, are you enjoying it?
B:	Yes,
B:	very much.
B:	Uh, course, I, I still work two part-time jobs
B:	So, it's not really total retirement.
A:	Well, it's interesting, you know, because when you look at what Richardson has done with the early retirement you,
A:	Jeri?
B:	Yes.
A:	We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.
B:	That's a rather, rather broad topic
A:	They're usually pretty broad anyway.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where do you live?
B:	Uh, we live in Plano.
A:	Okay,
A:	so, that's a,
B:	Uh, and where you are?
A:	I'm in Richardson,
A:	so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, uh, Maceo High School in Dallas.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right,
B:	that is so frightening.
A:	It is, you know,
B:	Uh, do you have children in school?
A:	No,
A:	mine are already in college now,
A:	so I don't have to,
B:	Yeah.
A:	at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.
B:	Well, I have,
B:	my oldest is his first year in high school
B:	so we have all this to, to look forward to,
B:	and it is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.
B:	I mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,
B:	but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening.
A:	That's true.
B:	And, uh, I really, you know,
B:	they're coming down on the principal,
B:	but I really don't know what they can do.
B:	I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence
B:	and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
B:	and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.
B:	Well I don't either,
B:	but apparently they just really are.
B:	Uh I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get for for being in a, a large area.
B:	But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about having guns
B:	and uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.
A:	Oh, my heavens.
B:	And, I mean, it just scared me to death
B:	and, you know, they called the police
B:	and, and nothing happened,
B:	but my goodness you know, it, it could have easily.
A:	Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.
B:	Maybe so.
A:	You know, because I don't,
A:	now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,
A:	and people don't do anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now.
A:	And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	But nobody, nobody did anything.
B:	I just can't imagine that.
A:	You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.
A:	Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming
B:	Right.
A:	I'm afraid, you know, if you,
A:	I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.
B:	Right,
B:	well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,
B:	but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I,
A:	I just, you know,
A:	it's, it's really frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons
A:	and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.
B:	Right.
B:	Well I, I think you're right there.
B:	I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,
B:	but I think that's real dangerous
B:	and, uh, I don't know.
B:	I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, you know
B:	and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.
A:	Yes.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just,
A:	I don't know,
A:	people just don't,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.
B:	Well, maybe this thing with with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to, to correct it.
B:	I don't know,
B:	it's, it really is, is frightening.
A:	Yeah
B:	I, uh,
A:	Let me ask you,
A:	getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing,
A:	he didn't have a license for the gun, correct?
B:	I don't know.
B:	I mean, I don't know the details.
B:	This was not a child that was on the team.
B:	It was someone that, uh, you know, just kind of showed up at the field.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it was a, a student age person,
B:	but I'm not even,
A:	Tell me what you like to do.
B:	Well, I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business,
B:	but it's a little sideline, part time thing.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	wonderful.
B:	And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here.
A:	Oh.
A:	Wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really neat.
B:	And, uh, uh, course I've been working on it for five years,
B:	but, you know,
A:	Oh, but how wonderful.
A:	Are you close to getting it done?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's getting real close to
A:	Oh.
B:	you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done,
B:	and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
B:	No,
B:	actually, uh, I'm not even sure,
B:	I may,
B:	I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	kind of your getaway place.
B:	Yeah,
B:	escape.
B:	But it's beautiful,
B:	it's, you know, it's Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest,
B:	there are a lot of pine trees,
B:	but it's mostly oaks
B:	and .
A:	Oh, how beautiful,
A:	and it's pretty flat there?
B:	Well, it's kind of, hilly,
B:	but, it's, you know, low hills,
B:	it's not, uh,
A:	See, I've only been to Texas once.
A:	I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas,
A:	and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
B:	You,
A:	I liked the hills and the trees,
B:	Yeah,
B:	in
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really different because that's kind of the, you know, that's the chalk hills down there,  limestone hills,
A:	Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	except for time in service.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Born and raised Texan, huh.
B:	Yeah. At, at which one?
A:	Well, I had never been there,
A:	that's pretty neat.
A:	My sisters both seem to like it pretty well.
A:	My brother-in-law works for the University, um, in Dallas.
A:	He's admissions director.
A:	Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.
B:	Oh, okay
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's just north of me here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's, he's got a job there
A:	and this is his first year,
A:	so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
B:	That's great.
A:	But they seem to like it okay.
A:	I think they're too far away from me,
A:	but maybe some day they can get closer,
B:	Well, yeah,
A:	we'll see.
B:	Pretty good trip.
B:	So what do you, what kind of hobbies are you in?
A:	Well, I'm mother of four,
A:	so basically I'm just, real busy with my kids right now in sports,
A:	and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight,
A:	and, I substitute at the schools part-time.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Well, I am a travel agent at heart,
A:	and my hobby is just,
A:	I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh,
A:	but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,
A:	so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
B:	No, kidding.
A:	so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,
A:	and I'm enjoying it.
A:	I'm around my kids
B:	That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?
A:	yeah,
A:	it's great,
A:	it's great,
A:	and what else do I do,
A:	I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
B:	Ooh.
A:	and I enter things in our little state fair,
A:	and that's pretty fun.
B:	That's great.
A:	Well, but, actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports. Tennis,
A:	I play tennis.
B:	Ooh, I love tennis too
A:	Ooh,
A:	do you?
B:	and I ski, ski,
B:	do you ski?
A:	Yes,
A:	we snow ski.
A:	We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon,
B:	Uh, that's great.
A:	have you ever been there?
B:	No, uh,
A:	Wonderful place.
B:	I've skied in Colorado
B:	and we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper, you know.
A:	Ooh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Where in Colorado?
B:	I've been to Telluride which is on the west side and, uh, Copper,
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	Copper is kind of my favorite up there. Breckenridge and Keystone.
A:	Really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.
A:	I would love,
A:	I can hardly wait to get up there.
B:	Me, too.
B:	You guys, are you guys getting snow?
A:	We,
A:	it is snowing right now.
A:	We're to get one to three inches tonight.
B:	Oh, gee,
B:	I heard Aspen got three feet.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	well we're, we are on the dry side of the mountains.
A:	Seattle is only about two and a half hours,
A:	so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, um, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.
B:	I can imagine, my lord.
A:	And, um, so, and we're on the colder side,
A:	they're on the rainy side,
A:	we're on the snowy side
A:	and, um, we, we ski.
A:	My, my children all ski
B:	Oh, super.
A:	and we've, we have been to Whistler in Canada, which is just a marvelous place,
A:	Whistler and Black Home is in Canada,
A:	and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times,
A:	that's a, just a great place. But no not in Colorado
A:	since I was in college, since I went to school,
B:	What about Utah?
A:	Haven't been there,
A:	I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	haven't either.
A:	um, to don't, Adam, talking to um City,
B:	Always want to go to Canada Canada to Banff or somewhere like that
A:	Ooh, yes.
A:	And your kids all ski?
B:	Uh, not all of them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My, my kids are all grown.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But my youngest son is a skier.
A:	Really,
A:	that's great.
A:	Well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When they're skiing they're fearless,
A:	and they go off,
A:	Okay.
A:	When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank.
A:	I thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.
B:	Well, I haven't either, uh,
B:	I, I hate returning things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's, you know, it's a game to her,
B:	but I, I do not like to do that
B:	I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time.
B:	And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.
A:	Right.
B:	Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we've had it for a while,
B:	but all of a sudden it just wasn't working,
B:	and it looks like there's a part missing from it.
B:	My husband opened it up and whatever,
B:	and of course we don't have the receipt any more,
B:	so we can't take it back
A:	Of course,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
A:	Right
B:	uh,
A:	right,
A:	just to get you by five years
A:	and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
B:	Yeah.
A:	We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.
B:	Well, that's true,
B:	and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	And you usually get what you pay for.
A:	We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas,
A:	and they were like ten dollars,
A:	and we expected them to work nice for the little kids,
A:	and they didn't work worth anything
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we took those back,
A:	and that's about that
A:	all that were taken back in ages.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,
A:	Right.
B:	you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,
B:	and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	It's hard.
B:	We never could get it declared a lemon,
B:	and the car would go
B:	and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty
B:	and it would stop
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	and I,
B:	there was just,
B:	you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything,
B:	and they got it finally semifixed,
B:	but it was such a hassle
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and it just pertained to that
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	it, it really is, uh,
B:	but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.
A:	I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy,
A:	it seems like,
A:	and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there,
A:	but, But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so.
B:	Well, I think that's true,
B:	and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my husband is really good at fixing things, too,
A:	so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor,
A:	and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, but, it was interesting to,
A:	I don't know if they're making them better or not,
A:	I, it's hard to say.
A:	Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier,
A:	but I think the technology is better.
B:	I think technology is better,
B:	I'm, I'm not sure.
B:	I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
A:	About quality.
B:	I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	I, I,
B:	everything is so automated, uh,
B:	and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something,
A:	so
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	that's that's true.
A:	so.
A:	So, if we get what we what we deserve
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows
B:	and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.
A:	Well, you keep up with current events?
B:	Um, somewhat.
B:	Yeah,
B:	somewhat
A:	Not,
B:	not as well as I would like to probably
A:	Is that right?
B:	but that's the way it goes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania.
B:	What?
A:	Where in Pennsylvania?
B:	Um, State College,
B:	I go to Penn State.
A:	Oh, do you,
A:	well, great.
B:	Yep.
A:	How's, uh,
A:	well no,
A:	we're not supposed to talk about that.
A:	We're supposed to talk about current events.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly, uh.
A:	Well, I'm a current event junkie.
A:	So I, I watch, I try to watch the news,
A:	and I read the newspaper,
A:	and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.
B:	I see.
B:	Well, what particularly are you interested in?
A:	Well, I just, pretty, uh, little, you know, about everything.
A:	And, not and then again not everything,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening.
A:	Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, other than that, uh, I just, you know,
A:	just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and know, feel like I know what's going on.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.
B:	I see.
A:	But I always have been
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I stay up with it.
A:	But, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware of most of the current events. Uh, newspaper? T V news, or what?
B:	Um uh, well, some of both.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I read, I read the newspapers sometimes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
B:	and I read magazines, and such.
A:	Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I mean, not, not that badly anyway,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I am, I am interested in what's going on,
B:	and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, you've been there
B:	and, yeah.
A:	well, you would be interested in it then.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	Yeah, uh,
A:	I follow it, you know,
A:	I don't just read everything about it,
A:	but I'm always aware of what's going on like that
B:	Yep,
A:	and, uh, because it is, it's interesting
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I don't know,
A:	I feel sorry for those people down there,
A:	they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,
B:	That's true.
B:	They've never really had a good leader,
A:	I mean he was a terrible tyrant
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think it's been better since he died,
A:	but it's still been bad
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, uh,
A:	I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah,
A:	he was pretty, pretty much a,
A:	he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,
B:	I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, but then again, who, you know,
A:	those people are so used to it
A:	I guess it's the only thing that works.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?
A:	I think it's pretty darned good,
A:	I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really do.
A:	Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme,
A:	the media does,
A:	but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,
A:	and I listen to the radio
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	so I, you hear so much,
A:	you get a little tired of it,
A:	but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe
B:	Yep.
A:	but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really don't.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better,
B:	but I,  would agree that it's pretty good.
A:	I don't think so.
A:	I don't think our news could be better.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.
B:	Um.
A:	I don't see anything that they could do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I think that, um,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon
B:	The, um,
B:	Right.
A:	I understand what you're saying,
B:	Right,
B:	I think that,
A:	But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.
B:	Well, that may be so,
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh nothing is perfect.
B:	I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's true,
A:	I understand what you're saying,
A:	and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,
A:	that's why we have C N N.
B:	Right.
A:	C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, well, I, I guess it's a subject I haven't thought too much about.
A:	Uh, I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools, uh, as much as, we're expecting too much out of them.
B:	Uh, that might be a lot to do with it.
B:	I know a lot of it here in my state,
B:	I'm from Mississippi,
B:	I'm not sure where you're from.
A:	Minnesota, Wisconsin.
B:	Minnesota,
B:	okay.
B:	Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got to do with funding.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Problems with our educational system, a lot of it's due to money.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they're trying to spend money where we don't have it
B:	and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's, it is getting very expensive to run schools,
A:	so.
B:	Well it is.
A:	They've got computers now that you got to train on.
A:	There's just  so much, uh, more and less money to do it with.
B:	Right.
B:	That's true.
B:	And a lot of it, lot of it has to do with, uh, salaries too, speaking  of money.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Cause if you can't pay the right people, you know, they're not to be able to do, they're not, not going to get the people that can do a good job.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I, I, I guess that in, uh,
A:	talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools, I, I think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids
A:	and, uh, I think it should go right back to the parents. If you don't train your kids right then
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	I feel the same way.
B:	A lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	And then when the kids get to school, they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids.
B:	I mean, they've so severely limited
B:	what disciplinary action you can do.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I, I know when I, uh, was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean they do that now
A:	and they could probably lose their job
B:	Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	I feel that's got a lot to do with it.
B:	People aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah
A:	It seems that'd be a subject that I, I don't have much to say on
B:	Really.
B:	We, we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of, uh,
B:	our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education
B:	but he wasn't.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly.
B:	I know a lot, a lot of,
B:	if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, unfortunately, there's not many places to get that money.
A:	Yeah
B:	Then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different ,
B:	I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.
B:	That most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,
B:	they're teachers.
B:	And they may not know a lot about what they're teaching.
B:	Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses
B:	and they're trying to teach social studies.
B:	And they don't know a lot about that
A:	Right.
B:	Where maybe a physics professor,
B:	he, my professor was a physics professor
B:	and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level.
B:	So therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.
B:	And that causes a lot of trouble.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent.
A:	I know in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like to have nice fancy schools.
B:	Right.
A:	And maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with paying the right people to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Because, I mean, here in the town I went to high school,
B:	one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado.
B:	So when they rebuilt that school, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
B:	and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through, they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones. Telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building
B:	and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I know, uh, where I came from. We didn't have a very, uh, rich community
A:	and, uh, high school that I went to was very old
A:	and, uh, as far as I know, it's still there.
A:	They've expanded on it
A:	but they've never built a new one
A:	and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better
A:	and I don't foresee them, uh, building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, so what do you think about the school system?
B:	Well, I think they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now.
B:	I know my son goes to a private school,
B:	but, uh, I think they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.
A:	Uh, why did you choose a private school?
B:	Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a, at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school,
B:	so he's, he has been going to private since kindergarten
A:	Public school.
A:	Oh, has he?
B:	So,
A:	Then how does he like it?
B:	Oh, he's loved it.
B:	He is a senior in high school this year
B:	so he's,
A:	So he's been there all the time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's done it the whole twelve and, uh, so many years
B:	and it's been, uh, it's been really good for him.
A:	How big of a school is it?
B:	Uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper four grades, uh, about four hundred and something
B:	so it's maybe a hundred per grade.
A:	A hundred per grade, that's a good size.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is.
A:	Kind of gives them the, you know,
A:	I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids
A:	but, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
B:	and  he's done, he's done  really well,
A:	So they don't,
A:	That's good.
B:	and just, he was just ahead at an early age
B:	and I didn't feel like, uh, in, what was available, particularly in the first three grades
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program.
A:	Huh.
B:	And I just didn't think that was going get it.
B:	I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, uh, every day. But yet still be with his peers  age wise.
A:	Right.
A:	Still enjoy the,
A:	Right.
A:	Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, uh, my oldest is in kindergarten,
A:	so I'm in a little different  ballgame.
B:	You're just  getting started.
A:	I'm just, starting her,
A:	but, uh, seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh, can really get away with murder
A:	and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected as much
A:	and, uh, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know.
B:	That's  a big problem.
A:	And, uh, makes me  a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem to show that respect
A:	and,
B:	We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school.
A:	No!
A:	Heavens,
A:	no.
B:	Wouldn't have thought of it
B:	and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe
A:	No,
A:	you wouldn't.
B:	and,
A:	And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I understand, uh,
A:	I think that's wrong.
A:	I think we need to get back to the, show some respect
A:	and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be, basic respect for  for elders   and adults and particularly in, in responsible positions have not, uh, I don't think have, had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases
A:	Right.
A:	For other people
A:	and,
B:	and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.
A:	Well, how do you think that that's happened?
A:	You think our society's just, uh, stopped talking out,
A:	or this, uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,
B:	I guess, I,
B:	Well, the world changes,
B:	so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things.
B:	They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier age,
B:	so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time,
B:	but, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful of, uh, of authority.
A:	Right.
B:	And I just don't think that this  doesn't always get emphasized  anymore, uh,
A:	That just isn't coming through  is it.
A:	No.
A:	I mean, I remember, uh, well, it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's.
A:	We used to have to wear dresses
B:	Yeah,
B:	had to wear dresses, didn't you?
A:	and then you had to, go to dresses,
A:	they had to be a pantsuit
A:	and it was polyester
A:	and it had to be matching
A:	and,
B:	And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor
B:	and we hold the ruler up here
A:	Yes.
B:	and it's no more than so many inches above the knee
A:	Exactly.
A:	Yes.
B:	Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.
A:	Yes,
A:	so it's really changed.
A:	It's, uh, really kind of gone the rounds,
A:	so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.
A:	They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit,
A:	so I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that probably does have, have something to do with it,
B:	and it's also,
A:	Do, uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, uh, require to wear a uniform
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between like second and eighth grade did.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there are quite a few of your
B:	Okay
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, considering you moved here from California, I guess, the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have, uh, in California,
A:	I'm in I lived in central California.
A:	We have rain couple times a year
A:	and other than that, you know, it would be maybe October and then in the spring
A:	and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain. So,
B:	Especially the last few years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's kind of, it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there has.
A:	So here, I know that, uh, last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state
A:	and I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year.
B:	Yet
A:	Yeah,
A:	yet
A:	Still could come,
A:	huh.
B:	Generally if we're going to get them, it's not going to happen, uh, prior to January one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December,
B:	but usually the bitterest weather, if we're going to have any, comes in January and February.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Then by March things are getting warm again,
B:	so we really don't have, as long a cold season, I guess as people up north.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	it's so hard to predict here.
B:	It's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Lots of times.
A:	Well, today it's not bad out there.
B:	No,
B:	it's nice.
B:	I just came in from outside
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and it's, it's really pretty.
B:	It's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm a, I'm a scoutmaster
B:	and so I wind up going out camping with, uh, a bunch of boys at one time
B:	and so, it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So you do that even in January, huh?
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we camp year round.
A:	Yeah, oh,
A:	that's interesting.
B:	But, uh, It's, uh, it's definitely different.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And then, I guess you've been through a couple of summers here, too, right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have
A:	and they're not too pleasant
A:	It gets so humid.
A:	To me it's humid here.
A:	People that I know that come from, uh, like Georgia or North Carolina, Yeah, they say, it's,
B:	Oh, it is.
B:	It's not as humid. As Houston, say, or Atlanta,
B:	but it, But more humid than Arizona
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I find it,
B:	and California for the most part.
A:	Right.
B:	Were you northern California?
A:	I was central California.
B:	Central.
A:	Central valley.
A:	It's very dry there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's pretty hot in the summer.
A:	It's in the usually, you know,
A:	for a good three, four weeks we have over a hundred degrees.
B:	But it's a drier,
A:	But it's a dry heat, yeah.
B:	Hundred when you have a hundred here, everybody's dying
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know. Well, I lived in Africa for a couple years in Cameroon
B:	Oh.
A:	and that's a tropical climate
A:	and it really feels similar to this during the summer.
B:	What types of, What type, what type of business takes you to those climates
B:	or was that just vacation or something?
A:	No,
A:	I was, uh, working with, uh, I still work with Wycliff Bible Translators.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's an organization where we are looking to translate the BIBLE into languages of the world that aren't yet written.
B:	Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages.
A:	Right,
A:	languages that don't have anything written yet.
A:	So this is like the first thing that's written down
A:	or you know, first an alphabet is developed
B:	Oh.
A:	and then, uh,
B:	That's interesting.
A:	So,
B:	You don't think about that as a career, a normal career, uh, when you're thinking of things that people might be doing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's based here,
A:	uh, the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here in, in Dallas.
B:	So you're, you're with the home office now
A:	Yeah,
A:	right now I am.
A:	That's what brought me here,
A:	yeah.
B:	Well, the, uh, I think, uh, all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas, uh,
B:	the weather you know, does change fast
A:	Yeah.
B:	and things do happen severely a few times a year,
B:	but there's an awful lot of good weather, too, in between.
A:	Yeah
A:	I agree,
A:	I agree.
A:	I, I thought the fall was really nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice, too. After the last freeze
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time, uh, I like that. Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing, uh, outdoor activity, hiking and things.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's nicer.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do quite a bit of that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the, east Texas,
B:	and it is a little more humid out there than it is here,
B:	so I guess we'll,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There's not much between us and the North Pole
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then,
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, do you live in a home?
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We, we, it's a house we bought, uh, about two and a half years ago now.
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	First house.
A:	We've lived in ours for about six years.
A:	We had it built, actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, uh, it's our first home, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So what do you think of, of owning a home as opposed to, to renting somebody else's?
A:	Um, well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, that was quite an experience
A:	I, I much prefer having my own home and, and, uh, just the space and, and more privacy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you have, is it a fairly large house?
A:	Um, it's, uh, uh, it's like twenty-four fifty square feet.
B:	Oh, that's pretty good size.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's a two story.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How about yours?
B:	It's tiny.
A:	Is it small?
B:	It's not much bigger.
B:	Actually we had an apartment, two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is.
B:	So.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, uh, it's only like eleven hundred square feet.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Do you, do you have children?
B:	Just one.
A:	Just one.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, it, it, uh, all the rooms are small, I mean,
B:	but it ends up giving us three bedrooms, which we wanted. And, uh. Use an extra one for an office which is handy.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'd rather have, have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space,
B:	but, uh, that ends up costing me.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, like, um, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood?
B:	Well, they're, it's pretty typical, I mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood.
B:	Uh, lots of, lots of young couples with, you know, oh,
B:	I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, lots of kids and stuff,
B:	and, so it, it fits well, in the neighborhood.
B:	It's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood,
B:	but on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Is, is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood
A:	Uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it,  it, it does, it, it seems about, oh, probably average. Um.
B:	or is it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But our neighborhood has a, just a wide variety of, of, um, people,
A:	and, you know, there's older people here, and, and, um, people that are our, our age,
A:	we're in our thirties.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, there's a lot of kids, a lot of kids.
A:	People across the street have eight.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	wow, eight kids?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	their home just burned down matter of fact, and, um, last summer,
B:	Ooh.
A:	and they're just rebuilding
A:	and, um, their house is going to be really big
A:	It's.
B:	I'm sure, with eight,
B:	gosh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're building a lot bigger.
A:	He's, uh, um, uh, oh, not an obstetrician, an, an orthopedic surgeon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, so since the house did burn, they're, they're going,
A:	it's quite different than it was before,
A:	and it's it's a lot bigger.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, but ours is about,
A:	it's, you know, it's a nice home,
A:	it's definitely not one of the, the smaller ones,
A:	and, um, it's not the biggest either.
A:	But.
B:	Yeah,
B:	new ones, I mean, they, they tend to, to be real tiny, but that uh, especially in newer neighborhoods,
B:	my, my brother just built a new house.
B:	He lives in Wichita, Kansas,
B:	and the, um, the neighborhood actually fought him on it,
B:	because he, he was, um, the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood.
A:	Oh.
B:	Now, that's because he was, he's doing a lot of it himself and, you know, for example, landscaping and, and lots of the other stuff,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood,
B:	but but they were, they were pretty touchy on it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You.
B:	He was a little surprised.
A:	You know, that's interesting
A:	you say that, because we do have, we have those architectural codes here
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and when we, um, put out house in, um, they wanted us to have,
A:	there was one,
A:	we have part siding on, on the two story part and then on the back,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, they, there was one side where our chimney was,
A:	and just the chimney was going to be brick,
A:	and they wanted us to have more brick,
A:	so we ended up having to go halfway up
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	which, it does look nicer,
A:	and, you know, we would have like to have had all brick,
A:	but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it,
A:	and, but, it's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all.
B:	Right.
A:	So it's kind of like, they were.
B:	Kind of depends on when they get in, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and, I, and so it was kind of like it's they,
A:	ours is the last street that they built on.
A:	So the houses actually on our street are a little bit, they're kind of gone a little bit nicer.
B:	Oh, they have,
B:	it's gotten,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, just they, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh.
A:	it's like the second phase
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and so they've kind of changed the, the codes a little bit,
A:	and so that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any.
B:	Um.
B:	Well, see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they, they moved into a neighborhood and bought a, a real nice stone house down in South Austin.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and, the, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they, they do phase one,
B:	and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled, uh, codes and, and, and stuff,
B:	and then they come back in,
B:	and, and then they sell,
A:	I, uh, spent four years as a university professor.
B:	Oh really?
A:	And,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I spent three years,
B:	I'm teaching in public schools and elementary school.
A:	Oh, do you really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's great.
B:	I taught in Utah,
B:	and, uh,  Did you teach in California?
A:	No kidding.
A:	I did.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I did, uh,
B:	You sound pretty young for a university professor
A:	Well, I was pretty young.
A:	I was, uh,
A:	I had never intended to do it
A:	and I was, uh, uh, given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in, in, uh, uh, one of the business schools in the California State University system.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	At any rate, uh, the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is, uh, research the problem from the point of view of, uh, uh, what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You may be familiar with cooperative learning.
A:	Have you ever,
B:	Well you can, you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in Utah.
A:	Well, the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools.
A:	And, uh, what, what it involves, basically, is the use of peer groups
A:	and the, uh, teacher becomes a, uh, a sort of a consultant, resource person to the cooperative learning, uh, to the learning cooperatives, I guess they're called.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think that the combination of, uh, technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn.
A:	Uh, I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system, uh, that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster.
A:	Uh, school systems are, in too many states, dominated by administrators
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, both teachers and parents, uh, complain about the, uh, uh, the cost and ineffectiveness that results.
A:	So my feeling is that, uh, the, the problem is, is, uh, significant.
A:	There are plenty of good people, uh, available to, uh, offer people educational experience,
A:	but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it
A:	and, uh, I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research, uh, uh, of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance, particularly, uh, accelerate the, the pace of learning.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, my feeling is that, uh, those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually.
A:	I don't know what form it will ultimately take.
A:	Uh, uh, but, I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for, uh, inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior,
A:	so it must be the way we're managing the process that, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I see what year saying,
B:	yeah,
B:	I totally agree.
A:	I, I don't, I don't think it's, it's a matter of, of, uh, talented people to do it, both as, quote, unquote students and as teachers,
A:	but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities  in the past thirty years that weren't existent, uh,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you must see kids with real significant problems, uh, in some cases.
A:	Uh, course, I always see the,
A:	I don't know how hard, how hard is it, uh, in the public school system in Iowa City?
A:	Is it, is it, uh, deteriorated a lot.
A:	Do the people say,
A:	are they pretty happy with it,
A:	or,
B:	Well, I, I haven't taught in Iowa,
B:	but I've taught in Utah,
B:	and, uh, people there were saying that the way that the schools were going, a lot of people were going away and going to private schools, or else going to home, where they taught their kids at home. Or, you know, anything but the public schools and the ones that did have, you know, the kids,
A:	Right.
A:	Even in Utah.
B:	Yeah
B:	well, Well, uh, maybe it was the area I was in,
A:	Well, Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe.
B:	but a lot of schools had a lot of transient, uh, families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you, so, you saw a fair number of troubled kids.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, like you said, how they were, the schools are doing more things for the kids, they thought, than they were thirty years ago.
B:	I mean, they were, the school I was teaching at, the, the year I left, they were considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	As well as hot lunch
B:	and,
B:	Well, as far as I'm concerned and it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching, uh, REASONABLE DOUBTS. Which had a, you know, capital case in it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I personally have, uh,
B:	my own feelings about, uh, capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony.
A:	I do, too.
B:	Mandatory, I mean, summary execution, on the steps, that day.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, I think, you know, I'm, I'm in that same,
A:	I think if it's, uh, if it's a if it's a convicted, uh, felon on parole uh, and he goes out and, and commits another crime or kills somebody, I, you know, I, I feel the same way,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't think, I think that person is, is beyond, uh, rehabilitation
A:	and, and he should be taken out
B:	Well, I, I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I do know that some people, almost all people usually die before that point.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They just get too old.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, as far as capital punishment, on, on it's own merits, I have the trouble with the way it's applied.
B:	I think it should be applied, on a little bit more fair manner.
B:	Uh, and I've, I've said this very often
B:	and I believe it to be the, a very true axiom,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Kill you. They will kill you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if you're black and you kill a black guy, you know, it's, you know, two hundred hours of community service.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you don't hear, you don't hear too much about, of those cases.
B:	Well, it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We're the majority,
B:	so we can do whatever the hell we want to do.
A:	That's right.
B:	And you're the minority
B:	and you're stuck with it.
A:	Huh.
B:	But, uh, you know, we had this in the Vietnam war, you know,
B:	we had you know,
B:	population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent.
A:	Right.
B:	But the population of blacks in the military was about twenty-two percent.
A:	Huh.
B:	The handwriting's on the wall there, isn't it?
A:	Yep,
A:	it sure is.
B:	You know, but that's another issue altogether.
A:	Yeah
A:	it's,
B:	As far as capital punishment, I think that, uh, ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment.
B:	I think the guy should have ninety days
B:	and if he can't produce evidence not argument, but evidence,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, the only thing I don't, you know, I don't understand, I guess I, I don't understand our judicial system, uh, as it is right now
A:	because I, you know, if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution?
A:	I mean, how, you know, is there,
B:	Well,
B:	that goes back to when, uh, America was a, a colony of England.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In England, you went to court, you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty, kill him.
B:	Well, there were some people that, uh, that had a problem with that. Because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And he'll say, you know, hey, that guy did it, you know, not me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, or he'll have somebody lie for him.
B:	You know, people lie,
B:	it's a strange thing,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but they do that,
B:	and to prevent that kind of misuse of power, they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	And the judicial mishap in this event would be, hey, you got the wrong guy.
B:	Look at that guy, uh, at E Systems.
A:	Yep.
B:	They were they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He was too far away when it happened.
B:	He had witnesses that were, you know, they weren't dope dealers, they weren't drug fiends, they were employees of a, an establishment that had a very high level of security sense, too. And these were really responsible people.
A:	Huh.
B:	You know, and they convicted this guy because somebody says, well, he looks like the right guy.
B:	They all look the same to me, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Big lips, flat nose, yep, that was him.
A:	Yep.
A:	What do you think about, uh, uh, convicted, uh,
B:	Well, this is an unusual topic.
B:	What do you think about it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, at first I,
A:	it took eight times to find you
A:	so I told my husband, uh, you know,
A:	what should I say
A:	and then he reminded me,
A:	but, uh, uh, in his family, uh, what they usually do, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the, where to meet and, you know, just, to bring anything,
A:	and so they just notify everyone by mail,
A:	and then they just meet at, like, a park or something to have like a, a short, uh, or a small, uh, dinner type thing.
B:	Well, that sounds great, Ellen.
B:	How far away do they come from?
A:	Uh, they come from, well, they all meet in Portland
A:	and they come as far as, oh, Seattle
A:	and, and sometimes we've gone
A:	and we were we were living in Utah at the time.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And, uh, the, his, his dad's family is all around the area
A:	and his mom's side of the family, they all, uh, have their family reunions in southern Utah
A:	and people would come from Seattle to there and, uh, let's see, Nevada and in that area, Washington and Nevada to southern Utah
A:	and they would, uh, assign a different person, each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	that makes sense.
B:	Nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	and the people who are down there, like, they'll assign one person in the Utah area, one person in the Washington area
A:	and that person can call, you know, beforehand and just make sure everyone knows, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something like that so that everyone's sort of involved.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	You sound like you've had a lot of experience with this, then.
A:	Oh, well, that's my husband's side and my mom, my mom's, or my family, uh,
A:	we all live in southern California
A:	so we just have to either or, give a formal invite
A:	and we're all there
A:	so,
B:	Southern California's still pretty large.
A:	Yeah
A:	well, I mean L A, Orange County area.
A:	I mean everyone's, you know mostly not farther than an hour away.
B:	I see.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, my experience, uh, has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side
B:	and, uh, they haven't had a reunion since then.
B:	They just show up at funerals and weddings.
A:	Oh
B:	It was pretty serious and lot of yelling  and all that,
A:	Wow.
B:	but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer
B:	and they had people come in from out of town
B:	and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn
B:	and, uh, they had some activity,
B:	they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff
B:	and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree
B:	and, you know, a lot of that sort of thing.
B:	Since it was the first one that we'd had that, you could do that once.
B:	Now next time we have one,
B:	we'll have to think of something more creative to do.
A:	Well, you know, that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my, uh, husband's mother's side together is, uh, they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
A:	and, uh, inevitably everyone is just very interested
A:	and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones to add to the list, you know, someone's been born or someone passed away or, you know, something like that
B:	Oh.
A:	and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever.
B:	Well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy?
A:	Uh, I do, but not to, very much compared to my mother-in-law.
B:	Not a passion, huh.
B:	Uh, I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy
B:	and I, I suspect we will do more of it.
B:	Uh, I found out some, about some of the relatives I didn't, you know, I, I didn't even know their names, some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles
A:	Um.
B:	and, uh, there's a lot of things there you have to stop,
B:	they're really kind of fascinating.
B:	I found out my grandmother was one of a twin.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we don't even know where the twin,
B:	we have virtually no, no background on, on her on the twin.
A:	Really?
A:	Is it your, your grandma's own sibling
A:	and she,
B:	My grandmother's, uh, sister who would be somewhere in, in West Virginia.
B:	I'm sure she's, you know, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about twenty years ago.
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	Oh so,
B:	I'm, I'm quite a bit, I'm probably a lot older than you are. Uh,
A:	Well, maybe, uh, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, what type of magazines do you have?
B:	We take several at home.
B:	I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE,
B:	and I take, uh, DISCOVER magazine, and also, uh, C D AND STEREO REVIEW and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, I think and BOYS LIFE
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, .
A:	Oh, good.
A:	That's a good one, I like to get
A:	Um, so I take it that you like to ski.
A:	Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?
B:	I presume that I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that,
A:	do you think
A:	or,
B:	Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski show or something,
B:	but um, made with I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and, and new equipment that's come out and so forth.
A:	Oh.
B:	Some fashions are always in there too.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So would this vacation you're taking,
A:	did you receive information from your skiing magazine?
B:	Probably not.
B:	Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,
B:	and we just started looking around.
B:	I may have referred to a couple of them,
B:	but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information, picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to Crested Butte.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh.
B:	We haven't been there before.
A:	Um, that sounds nice.
B:	Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's supposedly low lift lines.
A:	Oh.
B:	But I haven't skied Utah yet,
B:	but I want to.
A:	Oh, well, you need to come out
B:	I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.
A:	Deer Valley,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they are,
A:	it's wonderful snow
B:	Well, how about you,
B:	what, what magazines do you have at home?
A:	Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,
A:	and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,
A:	and then we have some church magazines,
A:	but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.
A:	I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,
A:	so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,
A:	but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,
A:	and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,
A:	and so, it's really a fun one.
A:	I like that.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	It's good to get use out of one.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,
B:	I mean, I read it,
B:	but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	I've, I've noticed that, too,
A:	but they have been nice to have around.
A:	Every once in a while they come in handy
B:	I used to take SMITHSONIAN too,
A:	Oh.
B:	I liked that magazine
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.
A:	Oh. Uh.
B:	You get so many coming in,
B:	and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round.
A:	Oh, that.
B:	Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,
B:	and that's mostly my son's,
A:	Oh.
B:	but but I do read it, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, well that sounds like.
B:	And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he likes to try that,
B:	so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though,
B:	after a while if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	They do, they can do that.
A:	I found that they've been fun for my little girls,
A:	they're five and four years old,
A:	and they like to go through
A:	and,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	they're just kind of getting started now.
A:	Uh-huh. They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on,
A:	and so we've found good use for those.
B:	Mine is a senior in high school,
B:	so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail.
A:	Oh.
B:	You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's fun.
A:	Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,
A:	so
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	so you got a little bit of a gap there between,
A:	so we're kind of running the gamut
A:	Yeah.
A:	Okay
A:	what, do you do artistic painting?
B:	Uh, I do tole painting.
A:	Oh, you do?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I really love the tole painting.
B:	Uh, I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor.
B:	I would like to learn that someday,
B:	but right now my passion is tole painting
A:	Do you do a lot of it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago
A:	and I've done a little, uh,
B:	Oh.
A:	But it takes a lot of time
B:	It does,
B:	it is real time consuming
B:	and,
A:	do you sell your projects?
B:	Uh, mostly I have just given them away as gifts.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I've done, uh, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, oh, on and on, you know, just things like that,
B:	but uh, I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Where do you work at?
B:	I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden
B:	so,
A:	Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?
B:	No,
B:	I've wanted to do that, uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I have five children of my own,
B:	so it's
A:	That keeps you busy.
B:	they, they keep me busy
B:	and tole painting is just a, you know, something I do in my spare time
B:	so
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you tried any of the,
A:	well, do you cut out your own projects?
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	I have my own saws
B:	and so I really enjoy doing that.
A:	Huh. Do you, uh, ever spray your projects with the, I mean a base coat first
A:	or do you brush it on?
B:	I brush it on,
B:	yeah,
B:	I haven't tried a, a spray varnish.
B:	I use just a wood sealer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And I do a lot of woodworking
A:	and that's what I bought it for.
B:	Do you?
B:	Oh.
A:	But I haven't used it yet.
B:	Oh, well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now what type of woodworking do you do?
A:	Uh, fine furniture.
B:	Oh  do you?
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's why I brought, bought the sprayer is to finish my projects.
B:	Oh.
A:	That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking.
A:	I get so sick of making
B:	Oh, but it's hard to finish it, huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but spraying does put on a nicer finish.
B:	Oh, well, that is interesting.
B:	So, what kind of equipment do you have?
A:	For woodworking?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, let me see,
A:	table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers,
A:	and about it.
B:	Boy, it sounds like you're really into it.
B:	That is nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
B:	and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
A:	Yeah,
A:	the band saw is really nice.
A:	I have an Inca.
A:	I don't know if you've ever heard of those.
B:	Oh.
A:	But it's nice to have the right equipment.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is, that makes it easier, doesn't it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, have you sold any of your furniture
B:	or just,
A:	Uh
A:	not,
A:	mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, Making my own furniture.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
B:	Do you, uh, did you take classes to learn how to do that?
A:	Uh, just in junior high
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that.
B:	Oh, so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that is interesting.
B:	Oh, I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to.
B:	I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture,
B:	but mostly, uh, just do more,
A:	Like the shelves and,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	the woodworking.
A:	For your tole painting.
B:	Uh,
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, it's fun
A:	Good.
A:	Well I guess I'll let you go now.
B:	Well, they come on,
B:	we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us
A:	Oh, they do?
A:	Okay,
A:	so this is my first one.
A:	You're probably a veteran at this.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it has, it has been really fun.
B:	I've enjoyed this. Uh,
B:	like I say, I've made a couple of calls to Texas, and just talked to all different kinds of people
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I think you'll enjoy doing it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's fun.
A:	Sounds fun.
A:	Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?
B:	Uh, you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love.
B:	Uh, and it's there by the, Copper Mill restaurant, used to be the Hayloft.
A:	I am not
A:	well, we live in Roy
A:	, but, we
A:	is it on nineteen hundred?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, let's see,
B:	I'm trying to think of the name.
A:	I know where fifty-six hundred south is.
B:	Uh, I don't right off.
A:	Is that Ben Franklin then ?
B:	Ben Franklin,
B:	okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	you want to start?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I might as well.
B:	Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, uh, this, this, the ozone layer, uh, uh, issue.
B:	Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons,
B:	and that, uh, rather bothers me that, uh, I was in, in effect, uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive,
B:	uh, they could be made, uh, you know, inexpensive and lots of it, uh,
B:	and in that, and its properties were great, uh, with, uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work.
A:	Um.
B:	So.
A:	Have they stopped that practice now?
B:	Well, course there's a, a tremendous number of refrigerators and excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, uh, utilizing freon twelve,
B:	and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems.
B:	But, uh, there's, you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going to be quite a while before we can, uh, undo this.
B:	Now, that could spawn several good industries and help, pull us out of this recession,
B:	but you got to have people that can make, you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion.
B:	So, so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Because as I say, there's a, there's a
B:	well, how many, uh, uh, families own a refrigerator,
B:	and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from and how many people, especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with air conditioning.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks,
B:	and, uh, the only reason I didn't, uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, uh, most of your, uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I mean,
B:	so, uh, that's why I stayed in, stayed more towards, uh, uh,
B:	and that's a polluting type deal too, is the excessive, um, you know, uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, uh, like knocking on a really make, uh, make a mess.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars,
B:	Right.
A:	but that, that particular bothers me.
B:	Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel that's, uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because when you, when diesel is burned it's it,
B:	you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine
B:	it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. You know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily,
B:	and it's got,
B:	well, you know, its latent heat is high,
B:	but it's slow burning at, at, uh, normal pressures.
B:	That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so if the car sucks in, uh, fifty degrees,
A:	Well, how do you feel about trial by jury?
B:	I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. Uh,
A:	In what way?
B:	In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than, uh, by evidence that's presented.
B:	I have, uh, very little regard for the law presently practiced.
A:	Oh, do, do you feel they are swayed more toward, are you talking about with criminal or civil suits?
B:	I was thinking primarily criminal cases.
A:	So, do you think that, I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's a concern of mine.
B:	Uh, I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges. Uh, you know, doing the sentencing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The other thing, the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know, that a judge can be
A:	I, I like the idea of juries of your peers uh, in that you, you, you get more personally more than one person making the, making a decision.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And second of all, you get a wide variety of background
A:	so that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	my question I guess are they really your peers?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'd  agree with that.
B:	Uh  Uh, too often I think they are not
A:	That's definitely a problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, when you, when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if, if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I think that, uh, in such cases, uh, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, now I happen to know several judges
B:	and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury I would feel a little bit uneasy about
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the other two I feel, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I guess that's what I am concerned with.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I, guess I, I definitely agree with you,
A:	but the
A:	well, what I don't like about, uh, sentence, the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the, the same crime gets unequal sentences.
B:	This is very true.
A:	I, uh, I think there is more of an ability of you know, you know for selecting a jury, two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea, uh, the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I think, I think there would be a large variation in, in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board.
B:	Yeah
B:	and you do see such uneven sentencing you know, evidence of it in the newspapers and such, I mean where, uh, it would appear the crimes were very similar
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but one individual got twenty-five years
B:	and the other one was sentenced to life.
B:	So,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh,
A:	Of course a lot of that's also the ability of, of the defendant to, uh, get a good lawyer.
B:	Isn't that the truth
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There are times when is it, uh,
B:	oh goodness, my mind has gone blank it's, uh, Othello.
B:	You know where he says kill all the lawyers
B:	Every now and then one is tempted to see what, what.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree
B:	But, I, it's taken me a long time to understand that, uh, lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of, you know, as, as novices tend to think that, uh, attorneys care about justice.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I, I agree with it
A:	yeah.
A:	They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able to you know, of, of, letting, allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument.
B:	And they are very effective too.
A:	That the
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, even,
B:	I have been involved, uh, just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, his attorneys gotten him off.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the city has dropped their charges against him because their, the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge.
B:	So I don't know
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, this is a little bit of the subject,
A:	but one, one thing that I really dislike, uh, also that's, that's new is the, uh, is that I have heard that there are federal sentences,
A:	I,
A:	you know, actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, uh, uh, we have more and more leisure time because, uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.
A:	We don't even have to cook dinner anymore.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
A:	Uh, but I, uh, I've heard, I don't know this for a fact, but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together.
A:	That the kids maybe on the average get, uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.
B:	That's what I've heard too. Uh,
A:	It seems bizarre to me.
A:	I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the, the worst thing that's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Not so much because, uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming
A:	and I there's also some, uh, I think, uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time.
B:	Right.
A:	It's so darned easy to turn the thing on.
B:	I know it.
B:	I've, I tell myself sometimes, just sit down after work,
A:	So I refuse to have one in the house.
B:	Oh really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well good for you.
B:	Good for you.
B:	A lot of people, I talk to a lot of people about that
B:	and I've thought about it myself
B:	and I though about it a lot
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I still haven't done it yet.
B:	Well that's good.
A:	Well I'll tell you.
A:	Television sure makes child rearing easy on you.
A:	I mean the kids can be a real pest, uh,
A:	and turning the T V on is almost like magic, you know,
A:	it's like sticking, uh, an electrode into their pleasure center
A:	and you don't have to worry about them.
B:	That's true
B:	I've noticed that.
A:	But I don't think it's too good.
B:	I don't think so either.
A:	Uh, so, you know, I don't know,
A:	I take advantage,
A:	I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids,
A:	but I take advantage of, um, dinner time.
A:	We always eat together
A:	and, you know, whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them.
B:	Do you keep your kids, uh, active in sports or anything
B:	or,
A:	Uh, I guess our big outlet is music. Uh
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	our thirteen year old son plays violin
A:	and our, nine year old daughter plays cello
B:	Okay.
A:	and, uh, when our son started playing violin, I took up violin
A:	and when our daughter started playing cello, I took up cello.
A:	So there's plenty of, plenty of interactive time in, uh, practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice.
A:	I guess that's not a big surprise.
B:	No.
B:	Not for kids
A:	But I I imagine with infants you are, most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them.  Although,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well  I, I try and read to them
B:	and I take them to the park and stuff
A:	Oh, you know, reading is so good.
A:	I, uh, I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
A:	and I still try to read to them, although our son is not liking that anymore.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, they get to that stage.
A:	Uh, but I read, you know
A:	there's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book.
A:	Have you ever seen that yet?
B:	Sleep book,
B:	no.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's called a sleep book
A:	and, uh, you ought to get it.
A:	I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized.
A:	Uh,
B:	We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I think, I think his sleep book is my favorite.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, yeah
B:	I like to, I like to do it
B:	and they enjoy reading.
B:	I've, actually I never read a lot growing up
B:	and I never read until a few years ago
B:	I just started picking up books
B:	and so I've found that, you know, it's really important to me to get to read.
B:	To, I like to get away in a book, you know?
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids  to try and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So how  much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day?
B:	Oh, I probably spend an hour or two.
A:	Oh that's great.
B:	My wife works at night,
B:	so she does, uh, Tupperware,
B:	so she's gone a lot at nights
B:	and so  I spend a lot of time with them
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	how old are your kids again?
B:	They're two and one.
A:	Two and one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you have your hands full with them,
A:	that's for sure
B:	Yeah
A:	I , uh, try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of  repair.
A:	Actually, uh, that is really a sore spot with me.
A:	I, I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving
A:	but, uh, like ten years ago, uh, reliability of automobiles, at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal
A:	and not only that, but the, uh, repair capability of, uh, service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I,
B:	So do you have a car?
A:	Pardon?
B:	Do you have a car?
A:	Well, at that time, actually, I had a Volkswagen Rabbit
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it was, it was a real lemon.
A:	Uh, subsequently I got a, uh, Buick Century
A:	and it wasn't as bad.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, last year I bought a Honda Accord
A:	and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance
A:	and that is it.
A:	And it's wonderful.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We used to have a Honda Accord
B:	and they're good.
B:	They're really good cars.
B:	Every time I get taken to an auto repair place, you know, every time I go, I get taken.
B:	Bad you know.
A:	Huh.
B:	Woman goes in
B:	and they go all right, we got a sucker.
B:	Let's see how much money we can get out of her, you know
A:	Huh.
B:	That's what happens every time.
A:	Huh.
B:	Uh, so,
A:	So, what do you have?
B:	I have a Pontiac Six Thousand.
A:	All the more reason to, uh, have a, a Honda.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But our Honda just got old and just wore out.
B:	It was, let's see, eleven years old
B:	and it just, just out of it
A:	so you bought a Pontiac?
B:	huh-uh.
B:	My uh, ex-husband's,
B:	this is, just happened a couple of weeks ago.
B:	He's my ex-husband
B:	but just a few months ago when he was my husband, uh, his father gave us this car
B:	and everything is wrong with it.
B:	I mean, the power steering fluid leaks, the oil leaks, the brake fluid leaks, you know,
A:	Now
A:	how old is the car?
B:	Uh, eighty-seven.
A:	Huh.
B:	And he just doesn't take care of things
B:	and but I was awarded the car
B:	so. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic
B:	and I can trust him.
B:	So he is trying to get, you know, things fixed on it.
A:	Huh.
B:	But it's just, you know, leak, leak, leak everywhere.
B:	But, uh, you know, I hate to go into a, a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not, you know, and charge me twice as much.
B:	The last time I took it into a repair shop,
B:	the man told me I needed a master cylinder.
B:	So I said okay.
B:	And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars
B:	and then, uh, about a month later, a man was looking at my car
B:	and he asked me,
B:	you know, not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend
B:	and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on
B:	and he looked at
B:	and he said that's not a new master cylinder
A:	Huh.
B:	and I didn't even know what one was.
B:	And, uh, he showed it to me
B:	and it was old, rusty, just awful.
B:	It was no more new than nothing.
A:	So apparently it was the same one that was on there.
B:	Uh, more than likely.
A:	Apparently just, uh, uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up
A:	and that was it.
B:	That was it, probably.
B:	It was
B:	I was so irritated.
B:	And that's happened to me more than once or twice. just, just about every time I've went in somewhere.
A:	So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service,
B:	And, and you can hardly find one, you know.
A:	Huh.
B:	The guy that's doing most of my, my car now, uh, goes to my church
B:	and that's the only reason, you know, I go to him because I know him
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I know he will tell me the truth.
B:	Because he doesn't even charge me for, for doing it
B:	so he's not going to, you know, take me.
A:	Right.
B:	I just pay for the parts
B:	and he does it so.
A:	Well that's wonderful.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You're lucky.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am,
B:	so, I don't know.
B:	I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car, they're usually the worst one of all.
B:	We took our Honda to the Honda dealership
B:	and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	And so, idiots as we were, neither one of us knew much about cars,
B:	we, you know, they told us we just had to have one
B:	and we bought one.
B:	We didn't no more need no new engine,
B:	give me break, you know.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it was, it was not good
B:	and, uh
A:	Uh, I think, uh, actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the, uh, working for a large corporation.
A:	And, for me, there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit I think it's health care.
B:	Right.
A:	It's what,
A:	I think everybody would say that.
B:	Oh, and if you try to get it outside of your corporation, you're going to pay an arm and a leg.
A:	Right.
A:	Belonging to a group is the, belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you,
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, the, uh,
A:	sometimes I think it's more important than salary.
B:	Uh, do you also get dental?
A:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, I don't know if I would rank that second
A:	but, uh, since I have three boys, uh, it, it can turn out to be important.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	in a, in a given year, dental dental expenses can really kill you.
B:	Now my husband is with, uh, Northwest Airlines
B:	and he gets, uh, you know, the full health and dental
B:	and, uh, we have four children
B:	and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous.
A:	Right.
B:	And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it.
A:	Right.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	Or maybe they don't
A:	Right,
A:	uh, and then, uh, uh, if the cleaning doesn't get you, the orthodony will.
B:	That's right
B:	That's right
A:	Uh, I guess that would be up there.
A:	Uh, I'm not sure if I would rank, uh, how I would rank that next to, say compared to retirement
A:	or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great, a great benefit .
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And I, I think it's really something that the, uh, the government ought to encourage more because, uh, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country  and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, uh, Germany and Japan. Uh ,
B:	Right.
B:	Well, it's a lot easier to, to save it when you don't get your hands on it first
A:	Right.
A:	When you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has, and you can, uh, offer some incentive
A:	and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up, uh, the savings and the, that you wouldn't otherwise do
B:	Right.
A:	and ,
B:	Uh, what about, what about, uh, lesser, uh, benefits perhaps for you but for, for the women in the, in the corporation.
B:	For example, uh, oh,
A:	Leave?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do they even, do they have father leaves or anything like that?
A:	You know, I, I don't think so yet.
A:	They may have, uh, just plain parental leave, which either one can take.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I, their, uh, I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. Uh
B:	Oh, I do too.
A:	uh, uh, I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks.
B:	Oh, I think, I think it's just a crying shame, uh, for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.
A:	Right,
A:	and, uh,
B:	She isn't recovered
B:	And, uh  the infant needs her desperately,  at that point and time.
A:	There ,
A:	There ought to be, uh, uh, some compromise that could, where, uh, where the person would be guaranteed a, uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh, in exchange for a longer period of time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	I agree.
A:	It's, uh, it's so important to families then
A:	and, uh, and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up.
B:	Oh, sure.
A:	Uh,
B:	Especially in this day and age.
A:	That,
B:	You don't want to start over again anywhere.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you're right.
A:	I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I, that I would most like to see, uh, changed Uh, the, uh, parental leave.
B:	Well, I think they're at, they're they've come a long way.  Uh, at least some companies. Some of them, uh, my girlfriend, in particular, that works for a, a rental car agency
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, as manager and, uh, they have a very, very poor leave policy
B:	and, uh, I just don't know how, how women do it.
B:	Particularly, single parents who don't have the support at the other end. Uh,
A:	Right
A:	They do it by shortchanging their kids.
A:	There's no other way. I mean  uh, unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. Uh
B:	That's right.
B:	That's exactly right.
B:	Right.
A:	people moving as much
A:	And, uh, they just, it's just a terrible choice,
A:	you shouldn't have to make it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh you're right.
A:	And, uh
B:	One of the benefits we get, of course, is travel
A:	Oh, right.
A:	Boy,
A:	would I like to have that.
B:	It's wonderful
A:	Yeah.
B:	The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
B:	but you can't afford to stay once you get there
A:	Oh, listen I have friends in a lot of different cities.
A:	If you just fly me there,
A:	I'll take care of that
B:	That's right.
B:	You have to have an awful lot of fun
B:	just, just getting there, is, has to be half the fun.
A:	Right.
A:	So and, uh, I guess the,
A:	And you say you have some strong feelings about, uh, the issue?
B:	Uh, yes
B:	I do as far as, uh, as far as, uh, as far as immigration as a whole goes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that, uh, we simply must start accepting everybody in the world.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	there just is not going to be room for all of us.
B:	We don't have jobs now.
B:	I, I think, uh, I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time.
B:	Uh, I hope you're one of the employed right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I am one of the unemployed right now.
B:	I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company
B:	and, uh, I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings
B:	but they had two thousand applications.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I know that there are a lot of foreigners, uh, here, you know, doing my line of work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, of course, I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job.
A:	Right.
B:	So, how do you feel?
A:	Well, I'm a little bit ambivalent.
A:	The problem with, uh, and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it, uh, in, in terms of what, uh, really is driving it.
A:	They're not willing to tell the truth. The same way with, uh, issues of, uh, race and things like that
A:	I mean right now, uh, I believe there are two policies that, uh, that the government uses to modulate immigration. Three actually.
A:	One is at the high end, uh,
A:	they always want to be able to, uh, do some brain draining.
A:	They always like to be able to attract the, uh, Einsteins or the Professor Chou
A:	or, you know.
B:	Right
A:	They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field
A:	and so they can almost always find room for someone like that.
A:	At the bottom end, they, uh, are always willing to, uh, let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area.
A:	Those are two things that I think are going on. Although they, I, I don't think the politicians would tell you that.
B:	Okay
B:	and I think you're right in both cases.
A:	And then the, third thing is, uh, the political aspect of, uh, uh, letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico
A:	They cannot close off the Mexican border. Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be, uh, uh, would spill over to this country
A:	so they keep allowing, uh, the pressure cooker to let off steam.
B:	And I think probably it's pretty important right there.
B:	How do you feel about Haitian immigration?
A:	Uh, that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan
A:	I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into, uh, society.
A:	They're very difficult, uh, group to find jobs and, uh, and, uh, places for.
A:	And so, uh, uh, I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that, uh, in that they're pretty miserable where they are.
A:	But I'm not to sympathetic about, uh, letting large numbers of Haitians in.
B:	Actually, actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it would have nothing to do with political situations.
B:	It would have to do with poverty.
A:	Right.
A:	But if you let them, yeah. If you let them in a million at a time, it wouldn't make that, you know, it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But politically and economically.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Have you been, have you been to southern Florida?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I know about it.
A:	Uh, I mean it's, it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans, uh, twenty years ago.
B:	Well, I mean and the two of them together.
B:	I mean we can,
B:	it's just as well you know,
B:	it's hardly America anymore.
A:	On the other hand, you know, the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant
A:	So there's, uh, there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in.
B:	But there's some differences in the immigrants, that, that we're getting now.
B:	Well  I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration.
A:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	I think, probably your, a great deal of what you say is true about the legals.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now, they do not come here to blend into America.
B:	Uh, they, they don't bother to learn our language
B:	and, uh, first of all, they,
B:	I'm sorry, this, I really feel strongly about this.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We send a lot of money to Mexico.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Why don't you start?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
B:	I, uh, I refinished a couple of old, uh, dressers that were handed down.
B:	You know, nice it's nice tongue and groove, uh, uh, construction.
B:	Uh, that's been, I've been pretty successful with that.
A:	Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that?
B:	What?
A:	Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing?
B:	No,
B:	I've done some other things too. Uh, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've done both
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, uh, my wife has picked up a couple of things saying, uh, boy if we could refinish that, that would be a beautiful piece of furniture
A:	and, uh, we've done it a couple of times.
A:	I guess that  we've been fairly successful with those.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's, uh, that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's a good way to get started.
A:	Uh, I have a, a, uh, really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital, uh liberated it after a fire
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, uh, we stripped it all the way down and refinished it
A:	and it turned out to be really nice, uh, a nice desk. Maple top I think or or something of that sort.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, uh, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	You know, a kit.
A:	Oh. I'm jealous.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Still had to cut it and everything,
B:	but it was fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	I, I do do things, uh, that might be too crude to be called woodworking.
A:	I've built my own deck and, uh things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I've done the same. You know, like the trim around the house you know  the baseboards and things like that.
A:	And, uh  I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too.
A:	My, I, uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I do have a band saw and a router and, uh, things like that out in the garage.
A:	But I can't say I use them very often
B:	Um. Yeah
B:	, I'm looking at trying to get a router right now.
A:	They're handy, uh, they  they come in handy at the most unusual times.
A:	Putting doors in is the time when I'm,
A:	uh, I bought myself a, uh, template for making mortices and doors
A:	and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
B:	I'll bet.
A:	But I've, also, I've also used them for building drawers where you, uh, for rabbeting and, uh, because, uh, rabbeting on my table, on my, uh, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it
A:	and now I use it twice a year maybe
B:	Yeah.
B:	My my brother's used it a lot for making drawers.
B:	I don't  know,
A:	The big,
B:	what, what's your opinion of what a good router is like?
B:	You know I,
A:	Uh, I guess it,
B:	Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great.
B:	They've plastic parts and stuff.
A:	The ones that what?
B:	That you dial in on the side.
A:	Uh, I have never even I have never even looked at one closely.
A:	Uh, the, the little use that I've gotten from my router, I would say, uh, I would spend my money on the bits
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I have a, I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router
A:	and the, uh,
B:	How strong is it?
A:	It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time.
A:	But the problem is that the, uh, as with
A:	any, any time you buy a, a  tool with a, a, as a, as a package the bits that they give you are low end.
B:	Don't they,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh, bits is probably, uh, I mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars
A:	and, uh, uh, if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it.
A:	Because uh,
A:	I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself, uh, they won't last
A:	And I've never had the bits sharpened
A:	So.  That's a thing to consider is to,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They, they really get hot don't they?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they, they dull after awhile.
A:	Especially, I did some cabinets in, uh, ash and oak
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, that, that wears a bit down.
A:	We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets, uh which had been in the original, remodeling of our kitchen.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth
A:	And, uh, routing hardwood will, uh, take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've cut some one by eight oak before
B:	Boy was that fun.
A:	Right.
A:	That's, uh,
B:	Big solid pieces of oak are just tough.
A:	And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened, right
B:	Well, that was, you know, with a, with a circular saw.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, oh my gosh.
A:	Right.
B:	Is this going to be fun
A:	Yeah
A:	Well I've used mine on treated wood
A:	and now all my blades need sharpening. Because, uh, treated wood will also chew them up.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Treated wood can really make you sick too.
A:	Okay,
A:	so, um,
A:	yes
A:	we do keep, uh, well we started out keeping a budget about two years, ago,
A:	we have a computer, here at the house,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our, our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
A:	and then basically since then what I've done is, is keep track of it through the checkbook
A:	so that based on whatever we've got coming in, the check coming in, then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also
A:	because our house payment is once a month,
A:	that's our, our biggest, uh, expense
A:	so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each, with each paycheck, even thought it's really still there, so that I can keep, uh, uh, good balance, a running total, yeah through the month,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	A running total.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you all do?
B:	Uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much we have coming in each month
B:	and then, uh, we've,
B:	at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend.
B:	We sat made up different accounts like, you know,
B:	we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that
B:	and then we write down each, each time we spend something, we write down in a book
B:	and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we, you know
B:	we, we try to stay within a certain budget,
B:	so.
A:	Is it, is it hard to keep track of it
A:	or does it work out pretty well?
B:	Um, it takes some, it takes some dedication to do it,
B:	but it, it works out real well,
B:	so.
A:	And, and you're staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I stay I have to stay within it,
B:	so I, you know,
B:	and then we have that, you know,
B:	if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we call our slush fund or something
B:	and an unexpected comes up, then you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.
A:	You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month.
A:	That's a good choice,
A:	we've been trying, we're trying to, uh, do that this year.
A:	We've budgeted the money that we used to spend, we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year,
A:	we've taken that this year, and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards
B:	to someone else in the You've got paper under your table.
A:	and, uh, we have, uh, another loan with the bank,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we hope by the end of this year, that by doing that we'll be free, and clear.
B:	To be out of that.
B:	Free.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the only thing we have, it to pay off is our, is a automobile loan and our house payment,
B:	and that's the only thing we ever,
A:	That's good to be in that kind of shape.
B:	We try to stay out of debt
A:	What are you all trying to do long term.
B:	Huh. Oh it's long term.
B:	We just,
B:	he you know, his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that, that's all we,
B:	and you know, we just have our life insurance for right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done the, uh, CODA account with T I where they, we put in so much a month,
A:	and then they, or so much a pay check and then they match it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what we're doing.
A:	So that's, that's worked out pretty good
A:	and then, I used to work for T I
A:	and I have,
A:	when I retired from there, or left, I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I R A
A:	and we had an out, we had an existing I R A
A:	so we have, both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure,
A:	to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.
B:	Yeah,
B:	when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a C D for a while
B:	and, then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired
B:	and then so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see, we had one of the financial companies, um,
A:	uh, John Hancock company came out
A:	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we were what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house, um, special thing, buying land and building our own house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at, and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	or not,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That sounds interesting,
B:	we've never done
B:	we have,
B:	you know, just our, our life insurance guy has come out, you know,
B:	and he's set up, uh, you know, determined how much we need to, you know, we need if something were to happen.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is, since I'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh, what we would need if something happened to my husband, or what he would need if something happened to me,
A:	that's a, a big thing to think about.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah, you know,
B:	if, I would sell the, you know,
B:	if, he, something would happen to him, I wouldn't stay in Texas,
B:	I would, uh, sell the house and move back home, you know, to my home town,
B:	and, and, uh, I wouldn't stay here in Texas,
B:	so you know, I don't know what he would do.
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.
B:	Yeah
B:	mine too.
A:	Is, is there anything you'd like to add?
B:	No,
B:	that's about all for mine.
A:	Well it's been nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
A:	Bye, bye
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	How do you usually keep up with current events?
B:	Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an, hour a day,
B:	and then I supplement that with, uh, radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week, and a newspaper if I have time.
A:	Do you,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday,
A:	so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and, and try to catch one of the morning talk shows,
A:	and then I usually end up flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening.
A:	I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the, the week's hot events.
A:	So, I try to, I try to catch that, if nothing else.
B:	That's true,
B:	and, and how do you rate the, uh,
B:	are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving?
A:	For, for local news I think we do real well where it's,
A:	we live in a kind of small town,
A:	but I think we get excellent local coverage, um ,
A:	and I like the national news that we see,
A:	we, we watch N B C
A:	and I think they do a real good job.
A:	So, I'm, I've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get,
A:	how about you?
B:	On the whole, I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts.
B:	I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. Um, since I don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I think I'm fed up with trite.
B:	There seems to be more and more of it,
B:	and I understand the void that, uh, comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
B:	and as expensive as they are to produce, they certainly don't want any dead airspace.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us,
A:	and like you said, save the commentaries because I'm going to listen to the, the news and draw my own opinions.
A:	I don't really need their help to do that.
B:	I, I, we're certainly in agreement there.
A:	I don't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is.
B:	Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done.
B:	They're, maybe they're a little more efficient, or have more to do over that same time frame.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't know which that answer is.
B:	Uh, I think the, my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES.
B:	Do you watch that?
A:	I used to,
A:	but I don't anymore, maybe once or twice a year.
B:	Well, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs, uh , that I knew both the people and the incidences,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint, that was, in my estimate, nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings.
A:	Really?
A:	Yes.
B:	And it, ever since that time I just don't watch. Uh,
B:	so, I guess we have the, the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I had heard a couple of people, you know, that I had talked to about certain programs say that, you know, they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the, you know, news articles or whatever they had, they had already been familiar with.
A:	So, I started questioning just how, how bias they really were,
A:	so.
B:	I don't know I don't know how old you are,
B:	but it seems to me like the last, uh, newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, I don't, I don't know if you're familiar with him or not.
A:	No,
A:	not really, you know,
A:	in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I've seen
A:	but I never got to see his actual nightly news.
A:	I liked,
A:	I, I did grow up with David Brinkley. Uh,
B:	Well, Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold, of Cronkite
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he did a, a pretty good job.
B:	THE HUNTLEY, BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent, over the years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we, we used to watch, um, him and I guess, John Chancellor.
A:	And I always liked David Brinkley
A:	and and I used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting,
A:	but on the nightly news, now, he goes into his commentary
A:	and that's where I get, get into the problem with, with him.
A:	I frequently disagree with his commentaries,
A:	so.
B:	Well, once they've reported the facts, all they can offer is an opinion anymore.
A:	Right.
A:	What did you think of the news coverage of the war?
B:	Well, I almost felt like it was too much.
B:	Indeed, I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,
A:	Really?
B:	and I don't need their fill-ins, you know
A:	Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your, your prior experience with the military did,
B:	Yes,
B:	but I, I think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going.
A:	I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on.
B:	Well, I, I think, uh, my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES.
A:	Okay.
A:	What weekly, um, magazine do you look at,
A:	is it,
B:	I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT.
B:	At one time or another I've taken them all for a year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I believe in giving anything a chance.
A:	Sure.
B:	Uh, but I keep coming back to that one,
B:	so, I, that's kind of my favorite.
A:	Does that give a pretty good overview of everything
A:	or like, does it give, um, I guess, little encapsulated reports and, and then a few big stories?
B:	It's primarily, um, a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, here's what went on in Asia over the past week,
B:	and there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus of their main stories.
A:	That sounds good if you were short on time, you could get a summary real quick.
B:	Uh, it too is one those
B:	in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways,
B:	and I do most of my reading in the bathroom.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, and it's one of those that I can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there.
A:	Right.
B:	And it just seems to fit nicely, so that I can get it read in about three days.
A:	Well, we're working on a NEWSWEEK, uh,
A:	for the last couple of months we got, you know, an introductory subscription,
A:	so, we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.
A:	So, we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us, so to speak.
B:	Well, to broaden your horizons, make you think about different things anyway.
A:	It can't hurt,
B:	Well, anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt.
A:	No.
A:	I, I even, I enjoy reading T NEWS,
A:	I try to catch it because it's another example,
A:	they just, they just show you the words and the facts
A:	and they, they don't offer any commentary,
A:	and it gives me a quick chance to, to be caught up during the day. Because, you know, we don't listen to the radio at work at all.
A:	So, I don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything.
B:	Oh, I'm with you,
B:	I have to check T NEWS every, every day.
B:	It's my noontime dose of facts.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is, um, TALKING FINGERS,
A:	do you have that?
B:	No.
A:	You have different telephone numbers that you can dial,
A:	and then you dial in an access code
A:	and it will, depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, um, updated information.
A:	So, that can give you, you know, current news updates, current weather updates, things like that
A:	and it's, it's offered through the local phone company free of charge.
A:	So, that's, an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, it does sound very interesting,
A:	It, It really is, yeah, it really is nice, I mean, because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk, and find out about.
B:	maybe our phone company out here will get around to, offering something like that.
A:	So, that is something you might keep your eyes open for,
A:	I think it's, it's catching on throughout the country
A:	Well, how do you feel about it?
B:	Well, uh, I don't have any strong convictions about it,
B:	that's for sure.
B:	Um, I know I haven't done any Peace Corps service,
B:	and I don't know anybody in my immediate family that has, or, you know, has ever even thought about it.
B:	Do you know, uh, do you know anybody that's been it?
A:	No,
A:	the, the only people I know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries,
A:	and that's only because I went to Baylor,
A:	and a lot of students from Baylor go and, and serve as missionaries during the summer.
A:	But I think, I think that's a terrible idea.
A:	That's like forcing someone to donate to a charity.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, and it's nice to, to try to teach young people some, some, uh, uh, civil, uh, consciousness, but forcing them to, to donate basically their time and efforts,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's definitely up to the person, uh,
B:	so, I'd have to say that, uh, it, you know, the people who do it, well, some feel it's rewarding.
B:	I don't know, you know,
B:	but, uh I don't know how we got the subject, .
A:	You have to,
A:	I don't either.
B:	I have nothing to say about this.
A:	I don't either.
A:	I was, I almost hung up, because I thought, well, gosh, I don't, I don't really have an opinion except for no,
A:	I think that's dumb.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, how long you been in San Antonio?
A:	I've been here for, um, just almost, well, no, almost four years.
B:	Um, okay.
A:	And I lived with Dana in school.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	That's how we know each other.
B:	And, uh, you, you were just up there then, huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	last weekend. We went to Six Flags Saturday.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Had a good old time.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well, back to the topic at hand.
A:	What other types of community service would they be talking about.
A:	I mean, the, the recording mentioned the Peace Corps.
B:	Well, it sounded like, I mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,
A:	Yeah.
B:	or, so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe,
B:	or, you know, I don't know,
B:	I mean, but, uh,
A:	I mean, I'm all for donating my time to worthy causes,
A:	like I do some volunteer work here and there,
A:	and every once in a while I'll do, uh, a, uh, local Big Brother Big Sister thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or I'll go, you know, do a .
B:	But that, that time is minuscule compared to what, what, they were referring to.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to, to go do something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they couldn't cover my hourly rate
B:	I couldn't afford it.
A:	No kidding.
B:	But, uh,
A:	I have this thing against bugs, too.
A:	And seems to me like the Peace Corps,
A:	they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs .
B:	Yeah,
B:	Africa.
A:	Yeah,
A:	have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything.
A:	I'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well. I doubt that,
B:	but, you know how it is .
B:	I, I mean, it would, it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture, usually, I guess.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think that maybe that's why some people do it is, uh, to see the other cultures or, you know and some of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, to do that, I don't know,
B:	I'd have to be,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Oh, I don't know either.
A:	Growing up, all I knew was you go to high school, you, you know, you work, you go to college, you get out of college, and you get a good job and you work.
A:	And, and none of this, you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to to broaden your horizons.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, you know, uh, I know American Express,
B:	I'm I'm working at American Express now,
B:	and they,
B:	after a certain amount of years of service, these employees can take off like six months or something, for some type of sabbatical or some, you know, some, something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, it is something that I think, uh, you know, even the larger organizations will support.
B:	Uh, it's, it's really for the community to give, you know, to, to give back to the community type of thing.
B:	I don't know,
B:	it's for, I think, at the same it's for some people to, you know, help them grow in other areas,
A:	Kind of like joining the military.
A:	Well, I mean, in that respect a lot of people join the military to, to grow up and to decide what they want to do,
B:	Yeah,
A:	and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	maybe a little bit in that perspective,
B:	but, uh, and a lot of people have gone in the military, I mean, you know, when they're in the college.
B:	Sometimes it's to help support college, you know, the money.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, others, people don't know what they want to do.
B:	But as far as, uh, you know, the Peace Corps. I guess, I suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives.
B:	But I think a lot of it's, you know, when people get older, they'll do something like that.
A:	I'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I don't.
B:	I, I, I don't.
A:	and none of my,
B:	Didn't mean to cut you off there.
A:	Oh, that's okay.
A:	and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything.
A:	So I don't really know anyone first hand that's, that's committed a chunk of their life to do service work.
B:	I,
A:	Everybody I know has been,
A:	well, I'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah, or, or try to make a living.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I have no, I don't know anybody that's done that either.
B:	So, I, I,
B:	it's interesting we got this topic because I, I, I don't know what I marked off to get this,
B:	but.
A:	I certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one.
A:	I, I can't imagine,
A:	and the switchboard's been down for several days,
A:	and the last time I called it before it went down, I had this topic,
A:	and I didn't feel like talking about it,
A:	so I hung up,
A:	and I guess they, they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it.
B:	So you had the same one, huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, well. Well, you'll, you'll get it over with here
A:	I know.
B:	How many times have you talked?
A:	Oh, probably five or six.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Not a whole lot.
B:	Oh, I've done maybe four or five.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Did Dana sign you up for this?
B:	Well, she just sent me the information out.
B:	I, I got a hold of it, you know,
B:	I just sent it back in,
B:	and.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	she stuck my name on some list,
A:	so they mailed me the information that I filled out .
B:	What other topics have you had?
A:	Um, I've talked about camping with someone.
A:	I've talked about the weather.
B:	Great,
B:	great.
A:	That one was interesting because I talked to a man in, in Washington, D C,
A:	and it was hot here,
A:	and it was snowing there.
A:	So that was pretty interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I talked to someone about the, uh, the, uh, education system.
A:	I forget exactly what the focus was on that one.
A:	But that was fairly interesting.
A:	And I talked to somebody about credit card usage.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her, that, that she and her family just didn't have much,
A:	and they didn't have much credit available to them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work, and, and how you can use them to your advantage, and, and how, you know, you, you can do certain things with them.
B:	Huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I always, I use everything with my Visa,
B:	and I pay it all off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that's a good deal for me.
B:	I get free money for thirty days.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's the way I use them, uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	I try, I try to make sure I don't get in debt.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's always a good plan.
A:	I can't think of anything else that I've talked about.
A:	All that most of the ones on the list, I checked off stuff like football and, and stuff that I can, I, I would enjoy talking about
A:	and I haven't gotten a one of them yet when I've called.
B:	I had, uh,
B:	let's see,
B:	I've had fishing,
B:	and, uh, I can't remember, me and, I think me and Dana had football.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we did.
A:	Oh, how funny.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So we talked about the Cowboys a little bit.
B:	And, I'm out here in Phoenix,
B:	so we talked about Cardinals.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, so, so that one was all right.
B:	And then what else did I have?
B:	I think I had some other, uh, like staying in shape or working out.
B:	This other guy, I got this guy from New York,
B:	so.
A:	I had to talk to someone about hobbies,
A:	and the switchboard called me,
A:	so I was caught a little off guard,
A:	and I couldn't think of anything at all.
A:	So I started making stuff up.
A:	I told this woman that my hobby was gardening,
A:	and I can't even I can't even grow an ivy.
B:	And you've probably never gardened in your life .
A:	My grandfather gave me a plant once,
A:	that told, and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill,
A:	you could freeze it,
A:	you could, you could dry it out,
A:	no matter what, you couldn't kill it.
A:	Well, I killed it pretty quick.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't have too much of a green thumb either.
B:	So.
B:	I do have one plant here,
B:	it's been hanging out for a while,
B:	but I think it's one of the easiest plants.
B:	I can't, I don't know the name of it,
B:	but I'm not too much into ...
A:	Where do you live?
B:	Uh, in the Houston area.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I used to.
A:	I lived there for a long time.
A:	But I'm now in Palo Alto, California which is, I think, the recycling capital of the world.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	So, we have many recycling activities
A:	and I'm, and in full, uh, support of all of them.
B:	Oh, we are too.
B:	Our community is, uh, just starting to get organized about it.
B:	They just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our, our things and dump them off ourselves.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it,
A:	Well, that's something
A:	but it, it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better, um, cooperation out here, uh, by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra, uh,
A:	actually I don't think we pay very much extra at all too,
A:	but the, uh, garbage men, come by, uh, on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that's great.
B:	There's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out.
B:	I don't know if it's, the, if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded, uh, bags and, uh, bins.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have burlap sacks,
B:	Oh.
A:	and they give us one for aluminum and, uh, steel, one for metals, and one for glass,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags.
A:	So, we have, we leave three little piles, that they need out on the curb every Thursday
A:	and the garbage men come by and, uh, collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And, the, it really pays for itself because, oh, then the city, gets the money from the recycling.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we're, we're all for it.
B:	Our, um,
B:	we've got several bins in our, on, in our garage where we, uh, you know, sort things out and, and take it to, to the appropriate places.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the one thing I wish we could recycle is magazines.
A:	But they claim that because of the way they're bound they, uh, it's too expensive to recycle them.
A:	At my office, we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail,
B:	Yes.
A:	and they're, uh,
A:	one's for white paper
A:	and one's for colored paper
A:	so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or things like that goes in those boxes,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines,
A:	and there's no way to get rid of them.
A:	It just seems like such a waste.
B:	Oh, it does.
B:	It does.
B:	But I'm sure that they can, uh, find some sort of, uh, use for them if, you know, you know, there,
B:	I've seen talk about, uh, using garbage for, uh, energy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, you know, you could also apply the magazines toward that.
A:	Well, that would be a help.
A:	I wish they would do that here.
A:	We have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade.
B:	Yes.
A:	And it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things.
B:	Oh, I know it.
A:	We did have, uh, another novel, uh, experiment start this year.
A:	Now we can put all our yard clippings out.
B:	Oh.
A:	You can, you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags,
A:	they're about four-feet high.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you get them for I think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you, um, usually buy them by the dozen.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then you put all your yard clippings and, uh, leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible .
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And those and they, the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And then the, uh, they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing,
A:	and at the end of every year, uh, they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds
B:	Right,
B:	well, that's a great idea.
B:	I wish we were that, uh, involved in, uh, or that our city was so involved in, that involved in recycling, like that
A:	Yeah.
B:	because, you know, I've talked to many people
B:	and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it. Uh,
A:	If they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience, I think most people would.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, yeah. You know,
B:	and I don't mind, you know,
B:	at first it was the, the little extra money that you got, you know, returning the cans in and stuff like that.
A:	Right.
B:	But now, you know, I don't mind as long as things are getting recycled, you know, that we don't get reimbursed.
A:	No,
A:	I think it's, it's, to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up, then to get that two cents when you take it to the store.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I, oh, I know it.
A:	We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans, for cash.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But so few people, uh, have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back.
B:	Right.
B:	Yes.
B:	And then the, plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also.
A:	Now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags?
B:	We have,
B:	I know of one that, the one that we use, uh, has, uh, recycling for the bags.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and they're promoting the cloth bags. You know, the reusable cloth bags.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	They just take it off like they do a coupon.
A:	They can just subtract it from your bill,
B:	Oh.
A:	and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they say, as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop
B:	Yes.
A:	Here they don't want your rotted tomatoes.
A:	But they want any clean and dry plastic bag
A:	so I keep,
A:	and the thing is, I hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle,
A:	so right outside the back door, I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there, right outside the, that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers,
A:	and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
B:	I understand, uh,
B:	my husband about once a weekend he'll go, uh, to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that.
B:	He, he,
A:	Well, how nice,
A:	that's great.
B:	And, uh, it's so, you know,
B:	he, we have all our piles of, of recyclables also.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I remember at Christmas the, the only thing that I'm,
B:	when you were talking about the composting, the only thing that our city did that was they uh, provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees. Uh, to for them to mulch. For, for city use.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular, uh, compost, pickup
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they did say that you had to put it out within, I think it was, uh, three weeks after, Christmas.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse.
A:	It would have to be cut into four-foot lengths.
A:	So, you know , if we have branches or something, they have to be cut in four-foot lengths,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but otherwise, uh, they have to be in one of their paper bags.
B:	Well, that sounds like you all really have a, a great system worked out there.
A:	And they even picked up our, uh, Styrofoam packing materials.
A:	They brought, uh, the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying, we're trying something new next week only, if you have any, uh, of those little, uh, Styrofoam peanuts that, any of your Christmas presents were packed in, put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we'll, uh, take all of those back and try to recycle them.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, see that's one,
A:	But I,
A:	that's not going to be a regular feature.
A:	That was just a one time thing right after Christmas.
B:	Well, the,
B:	but, uh, something does need to be done about the Styrofoam that, uh,
A:	Well, those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I mean, they don't, uh, uh,
A:	They don't mash
B:	No.
A:	They don't compress at all.
A:	And they stay forever.
B:	Right.
B:	And I've seen where some places have taken a plastic and, uh, they're recycling them into other plastics. And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do too.
A:	The difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile.
A:	It, they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, because otherwise, uh, you know, they're not going to go house-to-house collecting it,
A:	and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full, to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right
B:	Oh, I was thinking about, you know, like the, uh, the Styrofoam used at, uh, the fast-food restaurants, that if everybody, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so,
B:	yeah,
B:	I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam
B:	but, uh,
A:	Now we quit that about two years ago, no, three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody.
B:	Huh.
A:	So, and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five-year drought
A:	and so it's a real difficult choice whether we want Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or, uh, china cups to use up our water
A:	But at the moment we're using the china cups,
A:	and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year,
A:	and then, uh, your supposed to keep it recycled every day.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	That's a,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they should last awhile
A:	Well, let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get, uh, better reuse of things
A:	because,
B:	I believe we are.
B:	I I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening.
A:	Yep.
B:	And so it will, it will be good, in the long run.
A:	It sure will.
B:	Well, I enjoyed it.
A:	Well, good to talk,
A:	Yeah,
A:	the question was, uh, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, uh, uh, I guess,
B:	Oh, I just read for escape.
A:	Okay
B:	Well, I mean it's,
A:	With two little kids I can understand that.
B:	Yes.
B:	It's that's simple.
B:	I read to escape,
B:	and I don't read any PARENTS magazines either.
A:	Oh
B:	So.
A:	What, uh, what kind of,
B:	Well, I just finished, just, I just finished one last night. A great book.
B:	It, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien.
A:	Huh.
B:	And it's, uh,
B:	God
B:	I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories.
A:	Oh.
B:	Strange book. Beautifully written.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Just beautifully written.
A:	By, uh, somebody who was there
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	a guy who was there as a, uh, foot soldier.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, he considered himself to be, you know, a, a true Vietnam soldier.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, any of the guys that were ground
A:	yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can imagine.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, what's the latest one you've read?
A:	Well, I tell you what,
A:	I'm a kind of, uh, a history nut.
A:	I'm trying to think back now,
A:	I read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, the last, uh, I'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, uh, one of the, the Michener, uh, LONE STAR or the, the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.
B:	I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work.
A:	Oh, well, I've had similar problems.
A:	It does tend to, to,
B:	Have you, are you a Civil War buff at all?
A:	Yeah, as a matter of fact,
A:	yeah
B:	Because I finished one,
B:	I think this is like two years ago,
B:	and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the Civil War, John Jakes with ,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and the novel didn't do that much for me.
B:	But, boy, the period of time was fascinating.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM.
A:	BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .
B:	It's kind of like a historical compendium, of the Civil War,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's not a story of the Civil War,
B:	it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events, that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's fascinating because I had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?
B:	There was a lot more to it than that.
B:	As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it was a political move.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the United States.
A:	All the other areas which would, I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, oh, may have been Kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They didn't emancipate them.
B:	Well, you know what else really surprised me, now
B:	I'm married to a native Texan
B:	and I'm not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh,
A:	I've got the same problem
B:	yeah,
B:	I'm glad you put it that way.
B:	And I have two native Texan children too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My husband is always, you know, talked about Texas being a, uh, rebel state.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, oh, my God, all this Civil War pride.
B:	I kept waiting for,
B:	where's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War.
A:	isn't much there, was there?
B:	They might as well have not even been there.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, they weren't a state
B:	and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, you know, who's going to be going there.
B:	And I keep telling my husband that,
B:	and he keeps saying, oh, no.
B:	I thought, okay.
A:	They supplied some, uh, you know,
A:	they were some groups of it, the Vicksburg,
A:	if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg, the battleground at Vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some Texas, uh, groups
A:	and they had an interesting time there.
B:	Oh, I'll bet they did.
A:	And down there at Sabine Pass, uh, I can't think of the guy's name
A:	but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.
B:	Well, you know, why they actually held them off?
B:	None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar
A:	That could be it could be it.
B:	Now, you didn't hear me say that.
B:	Outside of, uh,
A:	And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde, you know,
A:	over there on the Texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for Mexico
A:	and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at Eagle Pass.
A:	And they didn't get across the river there
A:	so they're, the last,
A:	and that was actually after the war was over
A:	but it was the last, organized battle between the two units was in Texas,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Texas participation in the Civil War was, uh, minor at, uh,
A:	it's been,
B:	Boy,
B:	don't tell that to a native Texan though,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, my god, they fought and won the whole thing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, my wife's from Galveston,
A:	so.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm from New Mexico
A:	so, you know, I was
B:	That's a beautiful state.
B:	That's a beautiful state.
B:	See I was raised in the Midwest which, you know, hell, we didn't even, you know, we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and besides, you know, if corn didn't grow there, it didn't matter.
A:	Huh.
A:	It sounds like Iowa or something.
B:	Iowa and Nebraska.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep.
B:	And then I had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts
B:	so, you know. What does that make me, an honorary Yankee
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or, God knows what.
A:	Yeah,
A:	on,
A:	yeah.
A:	Oh, well, my sister's living in Illinois right now,
A:	so
B:	Well then, she's going to come out well rounded.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that I've really gotten into reading,
B:	and I think this is because the kids are getting to me, is science fiction.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've always kind of enjoyed it.
A:	I, I used to read a lot more than I do now.
B:	Well, I've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, I get out like, you know, two or three books.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I, I'm trying to think of, oh, Isaac Asimov, ROBOT series.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I think I've read all four of them
B:	and I understand that there's a fifth.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot.
A:	I just turned around and looked at my brief, at my briefcase, my, uh, bookcase up here
A:	and I see ARMAGEDDON up there.
A:	And, uh, the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR oh, SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE, James Michener. Didn't get very far on that.
B:	You know, I think I read HAWAII, when I was about ten years old
A:	Yeah.
B:	or so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things,
B:	and I still even then I was so, so disgusted with it I, I tried to read, I don't remember which other one it was,
B:	whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I just, I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more,
B:	I thought, I can't do this.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it really
A:	the, the books are kind of, uh, imposing to say the least.
B:	Yeah.
A:	No,
A:	let's see,
A:	here's one called GHOST TOWNS AND MINING CAMPS OF NEW MEXICO
A:	now, not too many people have read that one
A:	I don't think.
B:	No.
A:	And there's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY, TEXAS there.
A:	I've got, uh,
B:	Is that a big, thick book?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I've got, yeah, and I've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY, IOWA.
B:	What the, what the hell for?
B:	Why Kingsley, Iowa?
A:	Well, because that's where my folks all came from.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And they had a centennial here awhile back.
A:	I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND,
A:	that was pretty good.
B:	Well,
A:	That was part of that trilogy that, uh, Bruce Canton did.
B:	Now that's one that, That's one
B:	I don't know.
B:	See, I had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if I'd call it science fiction or fantasy.
A:	Sometimes it's awful hard,
A:	some of those get very philosophical
A:	they can be in any setting,
A:	they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,
A:	the,
B:	Well, I loved that novel.
B:	And then somebody said, oh, God, this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston
B:	and it was raining all night,
B:	and I had a hole in my roof
B:	and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse, and, uh, I was reading DUNE. Which seeming rather ironic.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out, you know, like ten-gallon buckets of, of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and, reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	you're reading DUNE.
B:	and, I think that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read.
A:	That was a movie too, wasn't it?
B:	And the movie was awful.
A:	Was it?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	it was just terrible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'd, I didn't see it
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah.
B:	It was, it was beyond, uh,
A:	Patrick Stewart was in that.
A:	I guess the guy that's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing, uh
B:	I don't know,
B:	I just remember Sting was in it.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and if you were trying to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it
B:	even having read the book, and I've read that book probably three times, watching that movie, I couldn't figure out, what they were talking about, at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Couldn't,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I was real disappointed in that.
B:	Well, I'll tell you another good book,
B:	do you like scary things?
A:	Um, well, some history, books are pretty scary,
B:	Have you,
A:	but,
A:	yeah
B:	That's true.
B:	Have you read, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
A:	No.
A:	Somebody who, saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen,
B:	Oh.
A:	they didn't sleep all night.
B:	Well, see I, I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean the book is, is chilling.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have,
B:	Just chilling.
A:	no, uh,
A:	I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about,
A:	so.
B:	Then I won't tell you.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah
A:	But,
B:	It's just that if you're ever, ever really want to just be scared out of your wits,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's the one.
B:	That's the one.
B:	Yes.
A:	Even better than JAWS and some of that?
B:	Yes,
B:	because the the, the character that is so horrible is another human being.
B:	And you're just drawn into his, his horror, of him that you, begin to kind of like him.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	I mean,
A:	A, a Freddy Kruger type, huh?
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	This guy's smart
B:	and he's suave
B:	and he's all the all the, characteristics,
A:	Oh the worst kind,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	all the characteristics ...
B:	Okay.
A:	All right.
B:	Um, I, I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think,
A:	Yes,
A:	all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I think that it probably would be a, a good program.
B:	I think probably two years is too long.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think maybe a year would be, the longest.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you're probably right,
A:	two years might be a little too long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
B:	and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
A:	That's right.
A:	That, that would be the problem. Sure would.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So I think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	I'm not sure what
A:	but,
B:	Right.
B:	College credit is a good idea because,
A:	I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know,
A:	a super do salary of any kind.
B:	Right.
A:	but that, that kind of takes away from public service.
B:	That's right
B:	Yeah,
B:	they probably couldn't do anything monetary,
B:	but I think, giving, giving some kind of college credit,
A:	But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail, that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know.
A:	I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up
B:	and I'm not that familiar with them to know,
A:	I'm not either really.
B:	But, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
A:	That's right.
B:	You know,
A:	That's right.
B:	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	They need, young families, whatever,
B:	So, it's, it's a really tough question.
B:	That's right.
A:	they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Oh,
B:	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year
A:	That's right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	it sure would.
A:	It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like that, I would think.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, you know, I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	it has to be something that's voluntary. You know, which is pretty much the way it is now.
B:	They might,
A:	That's right.
A:	I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you've a choice of where you want to go.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	in their own community,
B:	right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true
B:	Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
A:	That's right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, that's true too.
A:	That's true too.
B:	But, they would have to be supported in some way,
B:	and I'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Me neither.
A:	And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
B:	Right.
A:	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's tough.
A:	It's tough.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is tough.
B:	It's,
B:	and I don't know who's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on implementing it, if they do.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I'm not sure either.
A:	But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, it be,
B:	it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything
B:	but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
B:	You go to school
B:	and you have a kind of a captive audience,
B:	get them all in the auditorium,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, I think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
A:	Right.
B:	but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
A:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's a real waste too.
A:	It really is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It really is.
A:	I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
B:	Right.
A:	that was, that was a big thing with him.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, I guess even back to Kennedy, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just don't hear much about it anymore.
A:	Like I say, I don't even know what programs are, are even ongoing now, you know.
B:	I don't either
B:	That's one,
A:	Anyway, it's a tough question.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is a tough question.
A:	Okay,
A:	well thanks for your time.
A:	I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Sure,
B:	same here.
A:	Okay,
A:	take care.
B:	you too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Well, how about you.
A:	Do you use P C
B:	Oh constantly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You and me both.
B:	It seems everything I do is computer related.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And if it goes down, then we're stuck all day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And so I like the I B M P C, personally.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	But that's pretty much everything I've worked with
A:	and, uh, I've become so accustomed to it that, uh, it's second nature.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you use?
B:	Well, I have an, I, I B M P S two, model thirty.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's kind of, kind of getting too slow for me,
B:	but my job, I'm an E D P auditor,
B:	so I audit, uh, computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level.
A:	Oh, huh-uh.
B:	And I use my personal computer constantly,
B:	not only do I do P C type things like, uh, using lotus or word processors,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So all I have on my desk is my P C,
B:	but I'm, I'm getting, not only our local area network,
B:	but I'm getting two separate mainframe machines, also.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	So we, um, we use, it's an I B M P S two also.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And, um, you know, every now and then the file gets so big, that, you know, it moves slower than I'd like
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	but I, uh, I do mainly graphic work on it. And, uh, a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I don't know,
A:	I just, I enjoy working with them.
B:	Yeah
A:	There's so many capabilities out there,
A:	I mean, the things you can do are endless.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've become kind of the P C guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And there's three of us E D P auditors
B:	and one of the three of us has an accounting background
B:	and so she's not real proficient in P C's
B:	and the other just has, not used P C's that much,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing
B:	and I'm the administrator for our local area network.
B:	And I need to keep that going
B:	and, So, I, I'm, I couldn't live my life without a P C.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	I don't have one at home,
A:	We have one at home,
A:	but I just don't find the time that I can use it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right now I would rather not have one at home, because I would work at home.
A:	Yes.
B:	Um, we've got a couple of portable lap top P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot, to do work.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night
A:	One of the reasons why I got mine, was before I went on maternity leave,
A:	they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because, I am pretty much the, like you said, the guru, in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and, um, so they didn't know how it was going to work,
A:	they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could, in the decks machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's almost like we could become too dependent on them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And oh, I, we use a lot of free lance.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And, uh, that's, uh, pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, it,
A:	uh, compared to the way the things have upgraded, Have, uh, really,
B:	Right.
A:	what's the word I'm looking for,
A:	I'm just totally drawing a blank
A:	But, uh, the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great.
A:	It's remarkable the things we can do now, and compared to, you know, a few years. Just the power,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm trying to, uh, get an updated machine.
A:	Mine, uh, is just putting along
B:	And it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip,
B:	but, uh, I don't know if my boss will spring for it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I'm determined to brake mine
B:	so he has to get me another one.
B:	We think about that a lot.
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, that's what I do.
B:	We had a printer, a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we had about ten people sharing this printer
B:	by, it was attached to like a central P C
B:	and you had to take your diskette to the P C to print something.
A:	Um, now that's awful.
B:	So the first thing has when I started working at this bank, is, I said, well, now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up.
B:	So I talked my boss into investing in a, it's not a, uh, a uh, real elaborate local area network,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but we can share the printer
B:	and we can, uh, send files to each other,
A:	Okay.
B:	And we can mail, send mail messages to each other, which is good enough,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	it's what we need.
A:	Right.
B:	And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it.
B:	But once he bought it, he has been so pleased.
B:	It's, it's fast,
B:	it's quite,
B:	oh, it has good copy.
A:	Right.
A:	The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've got a little, little, uh, I B M Pro Printer on my desk,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, and I can use either the Pro Printer
B:	or I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer. The one that's on the network or my own.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	So if I just need something real quick, and I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed,
B:	I can just print it in my office.
A:	Um, we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, it's just so,
A:	the budget restraints and things like that, it's, makes it difficult
A:	and, uh,
B:	They have gotten really cheap.
B:	Hewlett Packard makes, it's actually a dot matrix printer
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but the quality is almost laser quality.
A:	Oh, huh-uh.
B:	And I think it's called the desk jet
B:	and they're, you understand, I think they're about five hundred dollars now.
A:	And we, uh, got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't remember what kind they were,
A:	but, uh, we do a lot of transparencies.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So they just want black and white, which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick. Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, it, uh,
B:	So that's all you need for like charts and stuff.
B:	You don't need them in four colors.
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	If it was a customer presentation then that would be different.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We would want to razzle-dazzle a bit.
A:	But, uh, it's, uh,
A:	yeah.
A:	We have one in the office
A:	and if we want, well in our area, if we want to use it, we have to, you know, like you said, you had to change it, put it on a disc, And carry it over to there, and see if they're not using the printer,
B:	You use the system.
A:	Right
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, wait for an opportunity to use it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Until they got off the machine.
A:	I know,
A:	I know,
A:	I understand.
B:	That was,
B:	I was amazed when I came to work,
B:	I worked at the, uh,
B:	well, it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival
B:	and now N C N B. And now N C N B's got a little larger market share,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but it's the only, uh,
B:	well, it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas.
B:	It's the only one that's still alive.
A:	Oh, huh-uh.
B:	Any way, I work in a big prestigious place.
A:	Right.
B:	And I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this, this huge holding company, sharing a H P Rugged Writer
B:	I was going oh, wait a minute
B:	Come on guys,
B:	this is crummy.
A:	So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	We're pushing real hard though.
B:	We're, we're trying,
B:	well, see, the entire bank is not like that.
B:	We,
B:	the, the bank philosophy is one of innovation and, Lead the market.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the, uh, the senior vice president, over audits, is cheap.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And it's real hard to pry money out of him to, to do these things,
B:	but I was, I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
B:	and,
A:	Right.
B:	Um.
A:	We find it hard to believe sometimes, or hard to understand when, uh, we work for a computer company, and, uh, how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated, That's obsolete
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the guys that, some of the guys that run this place are very tight
A:	and it's like, Well, why do we need this,
A:	can't you do that with, you know, what we have,
A:	and when we try and then they complain about, this doesn't look good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Unfortunately, the, the, uh, computer equipment and, and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly,
B:	like for instance, we bought a have ...
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	that made a nice ugly sound.
B:	So,
A:	Your name is Lynn?
B:	Linda.
A:	Linda.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, sounds like you like to read.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.
B:	I don't read as much as I would like to either.
B:	I'm, I'm a single mom,
B:	but I have always loved reading.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you like to read?
A:	Um, well um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade,
A:	so most of my books are, um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.
B:	That what I've been reading lately a lot of.
B:	Um, my interests switch around dramatically.
B:	I used to read just, mainly fiction,
B:	and now I, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What kind of things have you read?
B:	Oh, I read all kinds of things for, um, helping people survive a divorce.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.
B:	Have you read that?
A:	Uh, I haven't gotten through it yet.
B:	You haven't?
A:	No.
B:	Okay,
B:	what would you recommend?
A:	Um, as far as dealing with divorce?
B:	Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.
A:	Good self help.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee
B:	Um, that sounds good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's one that we use in our work.
A:	It's probably one you'd find in like a Christian book store.
A:	I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm writing it down.
B:	That does that's sound really good.
B:	Um, what kind of counseling do you do,
B:	or should we stay on the topic of books?
A:	Um, probably should stay on the topic,
A:	but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read
A:	I'm a therapist for Rossa.
A:	It's a Christian treatment organization
B:	Oh.
A:	and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically,
A:	so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems.
A:	Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse,
A:	so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.
B:	Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
B:	they're at a bad stage anyway,
B:	and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible, as a teen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's, uh, that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that.
A:	Well, sometimes it's rewarding,
A:	and, and sometimes it's a struggle.
B:	Oh, I'm sure,
B:	I'm sure.
B:	Uh, what
B:	is, is that just the only type of reading you've been doing,
B:	or do you, have you read any good novels lately?
A:	Um, I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read
A:	it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, uh, reading, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.
B:	just joy reading.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I hear you there,
B:	that's for sure. Um,
A:	In fact,
B:	I guess, the last book I've read,
B:	my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I just realized I had never read it growing up.
B:	So, I just finished reading that for enjoyment.
A:	Um, that's neat.
B:	And it it was good.
B:	Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much,
B:	so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her.
B:	But I thought it was real interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading.
B:	I know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books,
B:	but, I, I keep lists,
B:	I must have a list of, oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I want to read.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Just like, I want to read that and I write it down.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've got a stack next to my bed
B:	So do I.
A:	I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book
A:	and then I, I get distracted, and, or have to start on another one,
A:	it's pretty tough to keep up with.
A:	I was trying to think of,
A:	I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
A:	but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read.
B:	Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the one I was thinking of.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I bought that one,
B:	and I didn't get into, involved in that one as well.
B:	There's another one he wrote that even sounds better,
B:	and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace, you know, like, and communities building communities.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Someone just recently said something really neat about that.
B:	Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends,
B:	and, uh, it was of the people from there that said that.
B:	His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent,
B:	and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.
B:	And he did, uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the, you know, one of the places.
A:	Uh.
B:	So, I've um,
A:	That's interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it really was.
B:	A real fun bunch of books that I read, uh, the beginning of last year were, um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't think of his name.
A:	Is it ?
B:	Pardon me
A:	?
B:	uh, no, uh, oh,
B:	it'll, it'll come to me,
B:	but he wrote, he wrote the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.
B:	Those are mind expanding books
A:	Um.
B:	His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of.
B:	I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though.
B:	But, uh, they, they were fun.
B:	They were real just books for fun.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?
A:	Um, not very long.
A:	I really just started.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How did you get involved?
A:	My wife has been working for T I.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	I'm a former T I-er.
B:	I just recently quit.
B:	And so, uh, I got myself involved in a sales job,
B:	and right now, my list of books to be read have to do with, uh, the art of selling.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa
A:	they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read,
A:	and, I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.
B:	Never,
B:	never
B:	there's never going to be enough hours in the day.
A:	I don't think so.
B:	Even if you took speed reading. Huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't think so.
B:	So, well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.
B:	Do you like to read mysteries.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a little bit.
B:	Do you like Ken ?
A:	Um. Trying to think.
B:	He writes, uh, spy novels, THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable
A:	I like that kind of stuff.
A:	I think the last novel I read I read, I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.
A:	It was a, um, last name's ,
A:	it's called PIERCING, no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS.
B:	Um.
A:	It's, uh, kind of unusual book.
A:	It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.
B:	Oh that sounds interesting.
B:	like phone knocking against It sounds really good.
B:	Hey, you should make yourself a promise that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,
B:	and you kind of forget the fun of reading
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	very easily.
B:	So
A:	Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.
B:	I think so, too.
B:	And I thank you for calling.
A:	Yeah,
A:	nice talking to you, Linda.
B:	And, uh, I'll have to check out that book you, told me about.
A:	Okay,
A:	great.
B:	Okay,
A:	Hope you like you it.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You take care.
A:	You, too.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay, Deanna, uh,
A:	on capital punishment in our state, they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I believe also in shooting of, uh, rape, I mean killing a rape victim. I mean someone in the process of rape,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I don't know what I don't really remember what else.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But.
B:	How do what do you think about it.
A:	I think it's justified.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Very much so.
B:	I agree, I, I, agree, you know,
B:	I,
A:	I think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, I do too,
B:	I do too.
A:	I mean, I think they're doing their duty,
A:	but I think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it.
B:	They ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman.
A:	That's right,
A:	I agree.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I agree.
B:	Uh, I heard something on the news the other night they were talking about, uh, oh, I know what it was,
B:	it was in our, in our little local paper, our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week, uh,
B:	there's a little thing at the bottom
B:	it's like a call in survey that says, you know, do you think so
B:	and so, and then you call this number
B:	and you press like one for yes and two for no.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And one of the things, the questions the other day, this last paper, and I haven't seen the results of it, I'm anxious to, was do you think that, um, capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers. Which I thought was a real interesting question
A:	Oh I think,
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	did you see SIXTY MINUTES tonight, by any chance?
B:	No,
B:	I didn't,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	Well, they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers.
A:	He's just a civilian,
A:	he's a black man,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he just got fed up with it.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything, trying to keep him quiet,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	but he's organizing people,
A:	and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory
B:	You know, I think that's what it's going to take, though.
A:	I think so,
A:	I think,
B:	I really do.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it's going to take, uh, you know,
B:	the police, I think, I don't think can do it, can do it alone, you know.
A:	That's right,
A:	I think you're right.
B:	It's going to take, uh, it's going to take all of us getting together,
B:	I'm sorry, I'm trying to,
B:	my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed
B:	It's going to take all of us, you know getting together and just saying, we are not going to take it any more.
A:	Right.
A:	We won't allow this in our neighborhood.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	And it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then quite often they'll get shot, because they're horning in on somebody else's territory.
B:	Uh.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right, uh.
A:	I think they said forty-one had been shot out of one church in the last year.
B:	Oh my gosh.
B:	The only thing about the death penalty and, and I know that, that they try to be careful
B:	and they try to be sure
B:	but these people are on death row for like twenty years, you know.
A:	Right,
A:	I know it.
B:	you know
B:	if, if, you know
B:	I, I think to be, you know being convicted is one thing, you know,
B:	and that's, and that's great if they're if they're sentenced to death,
B:	to me you could not sentence them to death unless, the case was for sure.
B:	I mean it
A:	Well it goes all through the it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're,
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	by the time it gets there
B:	and they've been convicted
B:	and then they've been sentenced to death,
B:	they're sure.
B:	I mean there's no doubt,
B:	I mean, I,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	then it should happen,
A:	yeah.
B:	there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind,
B:	there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty.
A:	That's right.
B:	So once, they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt, do it, you know,
B:	just,
A:	Right.
B:	I I guess, I mean that may sound, that sounds cold,
B:	but gosh, you know, we're keeping, you know we're, we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row, and not doing anything with them,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money
B:	and that's terrible to look at it that way,
B:	but.
A:	Yeah
A:	it is,
A:	I know
A:	but that, that's the way it is
B:	if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death, then do it, you know, uh.
A:	We had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death
A:	and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago,
A:	I don't know if there was anything in your paper about it.
B:	I didn't notice it,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	And there was a lot of protest,
A:	even Robert Redford, you know, was protesting this guy's execution.
B:	Gosh,
B:	yeah.
A:	So the governor backed down
A:	and I was so mad.
B:	Oh, man.
A:	The crime was horrible, his crime was just horrible
B:	Yeah,
B:	and those kind of people, I'm sorry, you don't reform them, you know,
A:	No,
A:	I don't think,
B:	I really
B:	you don't.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	If they're the kind of people that commit these excuse me, grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again, you don't reform those kind of people.
A:	Huh-uh,
A:	and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	and I don't know,
B:	the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas, you know.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	Well, if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard, then are can, can you be helped, you know,
B:	I have, I have my doubts, you know.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I do too.
B:	I, you know, I don't know,
B:	I think there's a point,
B:	some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do, it's just, it just gets out of hand,
A:	Right.
B:	and I understand that, you know, that, you know,
B:	my husband and I,
A:	Wasn't it Lewisburg that had a lot of, uh, bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks,
A:	or was it not.
B:	No.
A:	No.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	it was, I think it was the south east area, from Dallas.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	My daughter, my daughter lives down in Rowlett
B:	Yeah.
A:	and she was telling me about it.
B:	Oh really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I can't remember what the town was, some little area.
B:	We've had several here lately
B:	and, it,
B:	there were several of them in North Dallas
B:	and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas
B:	and that's maybe what you were talking about.
B:	Men breaking in, uh, to houses and taking, or a man,
B:	they, they think it's the same person, taking, uh, little girls right straight out of their beds at night. And, you know, breaking in, obviously watching them in the house, because they're breaking into the right window, you know, the little girl's bedroom. And taking them out, putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards.
A:	Oh gosh.
A:	And that's the last they
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, gee.
A:	Is that right.
B:	Yes,
B:	that is happened,
A:	I hadn't heard about that.
B:	I think there's been, I think there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.
A:	Gosh.
A:	They don't kill them?
A:	They just
B:	They don't kill them,
B:	no.
A:	Gosh.
B:	They've
B:	and they're all like, um, like anywhere from nine to twelve years old, I think is what they've been.
A:	Gosh.
B:	And he's taken them and, and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard.
A:	Boy that's scary, isn't it.
B:	Oh, can you imagine, because it, it happens in the middle of the night,
B:	so the parent, you know, these parents didn't know this, the, the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming, let me in.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	You know, can you imagine.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you wouldn't even dare put these signs in the little emblems in the window saying child in this room, in case of fire, you know.
A:	Have you seen those?
B:	I, you know, I've got one of those in Brian's room.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I never even thought about that.
B:	God, maybe I'll take it out.
A:	Yeah
B:	I hadn't even thought about it
B:	That's terrible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
B:	Well it's really bad that you have to be, you know,
B:	we, we were over at a neighbor's tonight
B:	and, my little boy is is just a little over two
B:	and their little boy is like five, you know,
B:	so there's a big difference,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they were playing in the back yard
B:	and we were getting ready to leave
B:	and I went out in the back yard to get Brian
B:	and the boys were gone
B:	and the back fence was open.
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	oh gosh.
B:	, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And she didn't act like it bothered her at all, oh,
B:	this happens all the time.
B:	And we walked through the fence out, the alleys, come to the back of the house, you know.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	And and I looked down both directions of the alley
B:	and I saw neither one of them
B:	and, uh. And she was like oh God, he does this all the time, you know, where are you you know, screaming, J D
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh boy
B:	And you know, my heart was in my throat, you know,
A:	And he's five?
A:	Shoo, I guess so.
B:	and, uh, he, Brian was two houses down. You know,
A:	Gee.
B:	and he, you know,
B:	I don't know,
A:	I know.
B:	Parents around here just let their kids run everywhere,
B:	and I just can't do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from, uh, from her front yard
A:	and her dad was working in the back yard, and had just left her few minutes in the front yard
A:	and somebody apparently drove up and took her
A:	and they never saw her again
B:	Oh, man, this is too scary, that is just too scary.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I let Brian play here in the back yard
B:	and we've got, there's two gates that go into the back yard
B:	and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And one of the gates has a padlock on it
B:	and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things,
B:	but it's on the inside,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's,
B:	you know, you'd have to like come over, they'd have to come over the fence,
B:	they could not open a gate, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	You know, I mean, if I don't hear him playing, I mean, I, I get up and come out and look out the window real often, you know,
B:	so.
A:	And watch,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	I don't blame you.
B:	It's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids
B:	but, I mean you do,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	better safe than sorry.
A:	And if they find who's doing that to those little girls, as far as I'm concerned he could, fry
B:	He could fry.
B:	Yes,
B:	to put it very bluntly, he could fry,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yes,
B:	yes.
B:	Because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder.
A:	Right.
B:	You know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, and I believe that,
B:	and this is one of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because these little girls will never be the same.
A:	Huh-uh,
A:	that's terrible.
B:	Never be the same,
B:	so, I don't know,
B:	it's it's really scary
B:	and I don't know what to, I don't know what needs to be done, you know
B:	it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail
B:	and when they do put them in there, you know,
B:	I'm taking a business law class at night
B:	and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney
B:	and, so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases, you know
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	and he said you can pretty much, you know if you ever get on a jury, you know, you're not told this, but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess, whatever you sentence them to,
B:	they're going to serve about a quarter.
A:	It's going to be reduced,
A:	right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	They'll serve, they'll serve a quarter of it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years, don't sentence them to fifteen years, sentence them to a hundred.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty, so. Which is really,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know,
A:	It's just not, it just doesn't seem right.
B:	No,
B:	it doesn't, it doesn't.
B:	They just get out, you know,
B:	there was a thing on,
A:	Well what are we going to do about it?
A:	How, I mean how can it be changed. Unless the legislature will do something
B:	I don't know.
A:	and they don't seem to,
B:	That's the thing,
B:	we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're going to have to say, if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime, you are going to be sentenced to death period, period,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and do it, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if you commit this crime, you will be in prison for the rest of your life.
A:	Right.
B:	We're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years,
B:	we're really going to do it, you know.
B:	It's just the system has just,
B:	and I understand they're doing it because the prisons are full,
B:	but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build, to build more, you know, and keep these people in them, you know.
A:	Right,
A:	I think so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it would be worth it everybody
B:	Well, I was watching a show about this the other night
B:	and, you know, they were like in a, I think it was on FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.
A:	All right.
B:	Um, there was a crime here in McKinney,  uh, a rather heinous murder.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There was no um, remorse shown by, uh, at least one of the perpetrators.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And yet, for whatever reason, um, his crime was not considered a capital crime.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	An, and quite honestly I, I feel very strongly that the, man the has no redeeming social values
B:	and if, if and when he comes, gets free again,  he will have no compunction but to complete that, that same kind of lifestyle, I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle,  and perhaps do the same thing again.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever.
A:	Really,
A:	I think that,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I I don't think our prison system isn't set up,  where we, um, rehabilitate, or, you know, restore anybody.
A:	I think it'll only make them worse,
A:	but, I, I believe that God can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it,
A:	but, that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow.
A:	And if you do kill a person and it is, you know, you're found to be guilty, I believe God establishes the authority of our court system
A:	and I believe that, you know, that I do believe that capital punishment is, uh, alternative.
A:	Even, you know, God can still change your heart
A:	but that doesn't mean,
A:	like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card, or the shopaholic, you know you get your life right with God
A:	but you still have to pay your Visa bill.
B:	That's, that's right
A:	You still have to, you know,
A:	so, but God sent us his grace
A:	and they give pardons
A:	but I believe if it's a genuine conversion, there's a genuine,
A:	and those prison people know, they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character,
A:	they see that.
B:	But,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, I, I worked in a prison in Fort Worth.
B:	Did you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a degree in social work.
A:	You see it, you know the ones that have a genuine character change.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It is obvious.
A:	And they know that.
A:	They're, they're not going to pardon someone from the governor,
A:	you know what I'm saying,
A:	they're not going to go, without going through every channel of authority in the prison.
A:	So I feel like you know, that's is, there is occasions where there are, they do spare lives
A:	and, you know, I leave that with the governor, who, of course, is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected,
A:	so
B:	Yes
B:	but, my concern is,  first of all that not all, all persons who I think, should be receiving capital, uh,  whatever, capital, uh, uh, uh, hum,  punishment,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Punishment.
B:	thank you, I'm sorry, I just got home from work
B:	and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's okay.
B:	Uh, that, not all of them are being convicted of it, that, that, the, the, they're not even being charged with that
B:	I agree with you that, that,  a person's heart can be changed,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said, um, for certain kinds of sin, certain kinds of, of, uh, breaking of the law, there would be a capital punishment.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right then it was, it was, uh, almost immediate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	As soon as, as the trial was over, then it was stoning.
A:	Right,
A:	but, in, in the Old Testament,
B:	We don't have a speedy trial,
B:	we don't have speedy, um, punishment
B:	and so it kind of loses its meaning,  if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	we don't,
A:	well, yeah
A:	we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian ethic of the judicial system for sure,
A:	but the the base is still there, the foundation is still there, though, of the system,
A:	but, I know what you're saying, uh,
A:	but also, they're under a law, because we haven't been removed from the law
A:	we've just been taken out from under, under a law.
A:	Because under the law if your child back talks you,  he would be stoned.
B:	That's correct.
A:	He, under the law he would be stoned,
A:	so we've been removed from the law, of from being under the law
A:	but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.
A:	We don't need to back talk,
A:	but, you know, it's like God changes your heart to not do that.
A:	He changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust.
A:	Because in the Old Testament, they could look all they wanted, just couldn't do it.
A:	But in the new, he's looking at your heart
A:	and so, I guess that's what, what I mean by their character changes and, you know, what I mean, it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart, what's the character showing me here.
A:	And, those, and then any of,
A:	if I don't think see, if I don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree, that this person needs to be excused, I believe for murder, uh, rape, I even believe incest, things  that will permanently damage, uh, the character of the child.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I believe crimes against children should be punished by, by death. I believe,  sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.
B:	I tend to agree on that, very strongly.
A:	And that's where we just have to, to trust the authorities.
A:	And they're not going to excuse people, if it was, was run like that,
A:	I don't,
A:	there would probably be very few exceptions to that
A:	and if it was done quickly and done swiftly
A:	and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have, pretty much.
B:	Plus the, all the judicial system is overloaded with,  all kinds of, um, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, um, civil things that clog the courts,
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and having sat on both, uh, uh, criminal and a civil, uh, jury,  some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because we're suit happy.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, but back to the, to the capital situation, sounds like you and I have a lot of, of, of, uh, common ground at least as, as far as, as capital punishment is concerned.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I would like to see some, some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, um, convicted,  and sentenced to, to death, that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way, because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family,  any of us, the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Anybody,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	An, an,
B:	him could be a her.
A:	Right.
B:	But.
A:	I know in Jamaica, uh, it think it's Jamaica, I think it's Jamaica, I know that they have, you know, crimes punishable by death,
A:	and I'm sure they hit a few every now and then,
A:	and I wouldn't want to be one of them, that are not guilty.
A:	But, I know that they have like, uh, their, crime rate,
A:	it's not Jamaica,
A:	I don't think,
A:	I can't remember which,
A:	it's, uh, one of the Caribbean Islands
A:	and, and they, Singapore, is it like that?
A:	My husband's going Singapore.
A:	And they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law
A:	and the law is enforced.
A:	And that's what, when you have lawlessness,
A:	I mean the law's not being enforced
A:	and all that does is lawlessness.
A:	We were, we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff, two years ago,
A:	and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack
A:	and everyone was out,
A:	uh, we were across from that big bus station,
A:	I forget what you call it,
A:	but anyway, and everyone, they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence
A:	and within two hours, there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing.
B:	Um.
A:	And, you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days.
B:	That's sad.
A:	Because, there's no, the answer is not being given to them, in the court system
A:	and I think initially, when our country was set up, it was set up with God
A:	and it was really an integral part,
A:	and no,
A:	you can't, you can't force people,
A:	but I think people are hurting
A:	and they're out doing crack sitting on the street.
A:	They were the kind of people that,
A:	I think mostly, we would want to receive it.
A:	If it was presented to see.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I guess, I'm kind of frustrated that, you know, we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon.
A:	I mean, it reeks of the BIBLE, just, the whole thing, the whole system.
A:	And, so I feel like if that was presented more openly, and not just relying upon, and para-church ministry to come in and do it, that, that the system itself,
A:	you know, you know what I mean.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I feel like that might be better, if it was run on a more scriptural basis, which would include, you know, you know, and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.
B:	However, certain uh, very liberal minded groups who do not, um, subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do,  such as the, uh, civil liberties unions and so forth,  will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath. Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out,  when people go so far out to the extreme, on either side.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because too, too often, there can be extremism that, that hurts from, from any direction,  regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know, you're right,
A:	they would lobby that
A:	and, and I see that,
A:	and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing, you know,  what's my part,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because I don't think the system is going to get fixed.
A:	I think it's crippled ...
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you go camping very much?
B:	No,
B:	I've haven't gone camping in years.
B:	But it's is something that I've done in the past.
B:	How about you?
A:	Uh, we try to go once, maybe twice a summer. Uh,  we, uh, just, you know, for like a short weekend or something.
B:	That's, that's pretty average to me
A:	We don't go for the long, you know, week long thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we usually go to, uh, a lake area, you know, where the campsites,  are and do that. Uh,
B:	Right.
B:	Do you tent camp
B:	or do you have a camper?
A:	Oh no,
A:	no,
A:	no
A:	a tent.
B:	That's what I you know,
B:	that's how I camp too.
B:	That's how I define camping
A:	Me too
A:	You're really roughing it.
B:	The rest, the rest of that is really not the same.
A:	Yeah.
B:	As a matter of fact, my, my, you know, the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it.
B:	Um, as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother,
B:	and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota.
B:	So,  that's, that's really wild.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Are you here in local Texas,
A:	I mean?
B:	Yes,
B:	I'm in Austin,
B:	where are you?
A:	I'm in Garland.
B:	Oh.
A:	Right outside of Dallas.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we, um, we have a five year old,
A:	and we started taking her, she was pretty young when we started, uh, camping with her.
B:	Oh, the kids love it.
A:	I know.
B:	I mean, they just love it.
B:	It's wonderful for them to be outside.
A:	I know,
A:	and then they, and they, you know,
A:	there's no T V,
A:	and they don't have all these modern toys,
A:	and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like,  that to play with.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Yes.
A:	And I like that.
A:	It's pretty fun.
B:	Well, how it,
B:	it's really is a, is a good, good family thing,  to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And,
A:	We, we try to, uh, go with another couple that have children also.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable.
A:	Plus, you know, we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff, you know,
A:	we kind of split it up. Uh,
B:	Good planning
A:	Yeah
A:	Because it gets, it really does get expensive if you, if you don't want to rough it all the way.
B:	Exactly.
A:	You know, even the sleeping bags, those are running, you know, a good thirty dollars a pop,
A:	and,  and so we've built that up.
B:	You're right.
A:	But,
B:	Do you have a boat?
A:	No.
B:	No?
A:	Want one bad.
A:	Do you?
B:	Oh, well, actually, I would, you know what I would love?
B:	I would absolutely love a sail boat.
A:	Oh.
B:	That doesn't go along with camping,
B:	but,  now that, that, that's what I would like,  to have.
A:	Yes
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Would too.
A:	We usually,
A:	uh, let's see,
A:	we try to go to a lake.
A:	My husband and this, uh, other couple that we go with, her husband, um, kind of likes, um, is it scuba dive?
A:	And, so we'll go to a lake and, uh, where they can go do that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We're close enough so they can do that,
A:	and the girls can play on the beach area
B:	And I would play on the beach area too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's what I would do.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's fun.
B:	I'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that.
A:	Really?
A:	Am I pretty Texan?
B:	You're pretty Texan.
B:	Yes.
B:	But you know, you know what's really funny?
B:	Um, I've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent,
B:	and, and I mean, there is just no way I've not picked one up.
A:	No,
A:	you don't, you don't sound like it to me.
B:	I've only lived here about six years.
A:	Oh, have you?
B:	So, if I have one, it must be very, very slight.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The Yankees can hear it.
A:	Yes.
A:	Oh, that's true,
A:	that's true.
A:	I, see I don't think I do,
A:	but, uh, but a lot of people do say I sound like,
A:	I guess, I have, I guess more of a twang,  to my voice almost a
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Are you a, a native Texan?
A:	I sure am.
B:	Oh.
A:	I've lived here all my life.
B:	Well, good for you.
A:	But, any way, uh,
B:	Have you ever been to Austin?
A:	Yes,
A:	yes
A:	we went last summer, actually.
B:	This,
B:	how was,
B:	I'm wondering, I'm really not that not familiar.
B:	I know there are some good places to go camping along the, uh, the lakes.
A:	Or is there?
A:	Okay,
A:	well, we didn't go camping,
A:	we just, uh, we did like, uh, we drove down to Houston to visit friends,
A:	and,  we went to Galveston and, uh, to San Antonio and then up to Austin. And, and kind of, uh, you know, doing the sight seeing type stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we didn't go camping.
A:	That would be fun though to go.
A:	That's one thing my husband wanted to do, was, on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went.
A:	And I said, Well, I'd love that
A:	but,
B:	It takes a lot more planning.
A:	It does,
A:	and, and ever once, you know, on my summer vacation, you know, my week-long vacation, I,  want to be a little bit pampered, you know, by a,  hotel and a waiter
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly,
B:	exactly,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, we're hoping to do like a three day weekend.
A:	There's, um, a thing called Pfeiffer Rim.
A:	I don't know if you have ever heard of it?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
A:	It's, uh, there's a town called Glenrose.
A:	I think it's around two hours from here.
A:	And, uh, it's, it has like dinosaur tracks,  and stuff like that
B:	Oh, that sounds,  That sounds great.
A:	and it's got one of those wildlife parks.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think that'll be fun.
A:	So we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend, go there
A:	and,
B:	Have you ever camped out of state?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't.
B:	You know, where you should try,  sometime is Colorado.
A:	Where at?
B:	It is beautiful.
A:	Is it?
B:	Absolutely beautiful.
A:	I've just been up there skiing,
A:	and, well, we've driven through,
A:	and,  you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, but not, you know, camping or anything.
A:	But I would love to camp,  in the mountains.
B:	Yes.
B:	Estes State Park is fantastic.
A:	That's what my girlfriend says.
A:	Yes,
A:	she loves that place.
B:	See, you need to go there.
A:	She loves that.
A:	She says that where we need to go sometime.
B:	It is. It's, you know, it's, it's high canyon
B:	and, uh, and there's this little mountain lakes
B:	and it's very peaceful.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, um, in, in the early fall time,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, I can't remember what type of trees they are,
B:	but they, all the leaves turn yellow,
A:	Oh.
B:	and it's just brilliant.
B:	And,
A:	I love that.
B:	Yes,
B:	you would.
B:	You'd like it very much.
A:	That's neat.
A:	That's neat.
B:	I know you would.
A:	I used to go camping all the time as a, a Girl Scout.
B:	I was too
A:	All the time. I got real used to it then.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I felt like we roughed it then
B:	Uh, well we did, you know,
B:	we really did.
B:	I mean, I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V,  and parking it and sitting inside and watching T V,  and having your microwave
A:	Right.
A:	Yes.
A:	Exactly.
B:	It's not camping.
A:	I mean, we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	I mean that is it
A:	You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff,  to really be camping
B:	Right.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well do you, you, you say you haven't been in years?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
B:	I'm, um, I'm a struggling single mom.
A:	Oh, gosh, bless your heart.
B:	and, uh,
B:	thank you.
B:	Um, it's, you know,
B:	time is precious,
B:	money's precious.
A:	Yes.
B:	Um, and it, it,
B:	I think I haven't been able to do it,
B:	and, you know, what, that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children,  you know, again.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women.
A:	I don't blame you.
B:	You know?
A:	I don't blame you at all.
B:	I hope,
A:	Years ago it would have been fine
A:	but,
B:	Yes,
B:	I, I really now,
B:	I, I have gone on one little vacation, just the girls and I.
B:	We drove down to Port Aransas,  and rented a little efficiency, you know,  and, and had a marvelous like two nights,
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that was great.
B:	And even at that, it, it was like the first time that I ventured,  you know, out of the city by myself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, you know, I, I stayed in a nice place.
B:	But it's still, it's real different not to have another adult with you.
A:	Yes.
A:	I
B:	You know.
A:	I can imagine.
B:	I'm just a chicken.
B:	I know lots of women would do it all the time.
A:	No
A:	I don't blame you, not nowadays.
B:	I haven't quite adjusted, you know?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now are you with T I down there?
B:	Well, I, I was with T I until January.
B:	I, uh, I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money.
A:	Good.
B:	So, well it's, It was a good plan but I haven't yet
A:	Have you?
A:	Okay.
B:	I got into sales,
B:	and,  I'm selling, uh, telephone systems.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that's neat.
B:	And it's, it's fun
B:	and it's interesting,
B:	but it's also, um, pretty challenging,
B:	and I haven't, I haven't started making money yet.
A:	Um. It's hard isn't it?
B:	So, yeah,
B:	it's, it's hard
A:	Now, how old are your girls?
B:	Eleven and fourteen.
A:	Oh, goodness.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So I'm old
A:	No,
A:	you're not old
A:	Who is You're not old at all.
B:	Well, excuse me just second.
A:	Sure.
B:	speaks to Honey, I'll be
B:	yeah,
B:	go ahead.
B:	voice, There's someone at the door.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Do you need to go?
B:	Well, um, I'm going to listen.
B:	We always check and see if we should answer the door,  at night.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's very smart.
B:	Yeah
B:	so, well, I've enjoyed this.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too.
B:	And, uh,
A:	And good luck.
A:	How many have you made so far, calls?
B:	I, I haven't made any.
B:	I've been just a recipient
A:	Oh, have you?
A:	They're all,
A:	this is only about my second one I've ever made.
A:	I've been a recipient on the others.
A:	How many have you had so far, do you know?
B:	I think I've had about four.
A:	Four,
A:	that's good.
B:	yeah.
A:	Very good.
B:	That's four each.
B:	Well, you know, when I had to
B:	this is my, my Gemini nature, you know,
B:	it's like what are you interested in,
A:	Yes.
B:	and it's like virtually anything.
B:	I'll talk about anything to anybody
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't,
A:	yeah,
A:	you bet,
A:	you bet.
B:	And it's, it's been real interesting, the different personalities That I run across.
A:	I know.
A:	Yes,
A:	I always try to find out where they're from,  you know,
B:	Exactly.
A:	cause, because it is neat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It really is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well then, I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door
A:	and,
B:	Well, thank you.
B:	And, um, I enjoyed talking with you.
A:	You, me too.
B:	You have a good time camping,
B:	when you go next time,  think of me
A:	Thanks.
A:	Okay.
A:	Thank you.
B:	All right.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	Oh, um, uh, I usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know, being, uh,
B:	I mean, by the time you get off work, go by and pick up the, uh, baby from the baby sitter, it's, you know, after six
B:	and by the time everything is settled in,
B:	it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess that's the way I am too.
A:	I, sometimes I hear some things on, on the radio.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh yeah.
A:	I only get the newspaper on the weekends
A:	so
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I don't even have, time to read the newspaper except in passing,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on.
A:	I,  I guess occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though.
B:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	We have, uh, a news thing on the computer that, uh, that I'll, I'll try to look at every day.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it, it's pretty much headline news.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we look for anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh. I, do you think that the quality of the, uh, the, you know, the news events that you get are,
B:	what do you think about it?
A:	Well I, I guess it's pretty good.
A:	And, and like the Dallas area,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I, I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this,
A:	there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,  borderline at that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, there's a lot of competition in the media.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh. You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	true.
A:	I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle East.
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	That,
B:	uh, lots of new, uh, newsmen were created during that
B:	so, it will be interesting to see what happens.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	true.
A:	Trying to think what else is,  is current.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh, uh,
A:	Well, um, I don't know what to say
A:	Uh, that's a bad one,
A:	they, uh,
A:	looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I hate to see that,
B:	but it's, uh, that, you know, if what it's going to take,
B:	well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our federal income tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, you know, but we need good schools.
B:	Uh, we're more involved in that now.
B:	And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	So,
A:	I would think they could find a better way to fund it though,
A:	but they haven't for,
B:	No.
B:	You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery.
A:	Well, they're struggling with it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.
B:	I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax.
B:	I mean, probably would have paid the same amount
B:	but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	True.
B:	So,
A:	I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that.
B:	No.
B:	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
A:	Trying to think what else is current.
B:	I, you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days.
B:	So it, uh,
B:	I'm a little behind on things.
A:	Well, the other thing I can think of is, uh, what is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees.
B:	Yes,
B:	that's, that's sad.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations,
B:	and,  uh, I don't know what I've would have done in the situation.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,  finish the job while we were in there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides.
B:	I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.
B:	I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away.
A:	Seems to have helped him though,  popularity wise.
B:	Yeah, it, it,  it did a lot.
B:	He did a real good job I believe.
B:	I have, uh, in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too.
A:	Hm.
B:	It, uh, it, uh, you know,
B:	we, so we kept very much abreast of what was going on.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Were, were they in any of the areas where they,  some of the Scuds?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they were on  the, the, near, uh, Dahran. On the,  on the east coast.
A:	Um.
A:	Um-hum.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They were just north of it. Probably about a hundred fifty miles, hundred miles from uh, the Kuwaiti border.
A:	Um.
B:	Uh, and they stayed active was the, uh, the military there. Taking supplies out to them in the desert.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was, it was a new situation.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'll bet.
B:	I don't really have much more to say
A:	I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather
A:	and,
B:	You're right,
B:	and that's, that's awful in Texas
A:	Have, have you all been getting rain storms down there?
B:	We got some awful rain, uh, the other morning.
B:	And today's just been real drizzly.
A:	We did, we did last night. Uh, some real massive thunderstorms.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Apparently, I, I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Caused some damage.
B:	It did?
A:	We may get some more tonight.
B:	Oh, well. We, we've just got slight chances of rain.
B:	But, uh, we had the, we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning.
B:	Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work. Making nice traffic jams.
B:	So
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well the, the ground here is so flat,
A:	and it's all saturated now,
B:	Oh
A:	we're getting some flooding.
B:	Right,
B:	uh, when was it, last week, we had all the rain?
B:	But, uh,
B:	we, I think we had about eight inches.
A:	Hm.
B:	It was between six and eight inches here where we are.
A:	Goodness.
B:	And, uh, it, you walk out on the ground,
B:	I mean you,
B:	I mean, it's awful.
B:	It's just so soggy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's a lot more humid down that way.
B:	Yeah
A:	In fact, miserable.
B:	Well, today it was, I mean, the air was just so sticky, so damp.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just,  a bunch.
B:	Goodness.
A:	Well, I guess that's it
B:	Right.
B:	Well it's,
A:	That's about as much as we can do with current events.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	Good talking to you, Michelle.
B:	All right.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	The public school systems, well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The first direction that I can see, or I wish, I would love to see them go with.
B:	Kids learn at different rates
B:	and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together.
B:	You'd learn at this rate
B:	and that's the only way it's going to happen.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true
B:	You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it,
B:	and the the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject, you've bored them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's very true.
A:	Um, I guess I can relate to that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that.
A:	Uh, one picks up real quick
A:	and the other one doesn't.
A:	And you're right, they do get bored, uh, really fast, if they already know what you're talking about.
A:	What do you propose that they do?
A:	What, what is your suggestions?
B:	The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, uh, the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Out of each child.
B:	Out of each child.
A:	Each individual child.
B:	Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff.
B:	Other kids are going to be really into math,
B:	some are really going to be heavy into reading.
A:	Right.
B:	Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's,
B:	But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in?
B:	Because if he's interested, he's going to study it,
B:	and he's going to learn it,
B:	and he's going to remember it.
A:	That's true.
A:	The only, I think the only thing that they would argue about that, is that, you know, every child needs to learn every subject.
A:	I mean, that's, that might be the only thing.
A:	But, I mean, I, I definitely agree with you. Uh,
B:	They need exposure to every subject.
B:	They don't need to be masters of it,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	That's true. Uh,
B:	Everything I learned about ancient Rome has not helped me anywhere in, my adult life.
A:	Yes,
A:	I definitely agree.
A:	There's no doubt about that.
A:	I, uh, I, I mean, I can relate to that because I'm, I'm going to college right now,
A:	and I feel like, I mean, I'm taking this history class.
A:	And, I mean, it's so boring,
A:	and I just hate it.
A:	And I think, why do they make us take this stuff?
A:	I mean, what does this have to do with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know?
B:	What, what type of history class is it that you're having to take?
A:	Uh, American History.
A:	We have to take, um, like this is like early seventeen hundreds through, I don't know, I think like mid eighteen hundreds.
A:	And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up, to basically present.
B:	Well, the early ones they could actually combine two, two, levels of it, the one from seventeen hundred til say, the end of the Civil War.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Combine that into one. And then from eighteen sixty-five to present,
B:	and make that your second step because, To a point, to a point the bottom, you know, the early parts of it, you're giving the foundations of the nation
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's, well that's, basically what they're doing.
B:	and, but even then they're skimming over,
B:	they're very, almost trivial with it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, yes.
A:	Definitely,
A:	I agree.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's,
B:	You know, I mean, if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, I mean, there's, they make all these people out to be, oh,
B:	they were great men,
B:	and they're the father of the country and all this.
B:	He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else.
B:	If not more.
B:	The man was not a saint.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true,
A:	yeah.
A:	Any way, this, this, um, school system thing,
A:	I, I tell you, I saw something on the news, oh, I don't know, maybe two weeks ago.
A:	And they were talking about,
A:	I don't know where you're from,
A:	but I'm from the Dallas area.
A:	And they were talking about the Plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, I mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. They took these students and put them basically in a closet. With no windows.
A:	They had, a, a table, or not a table, but a desk in this closet,
A:	and they had to sit in there by themselves.
A:	Well, parents were getting really angry about this, because they said, Why is my child being put in this closet.
A:	Well, how is that helping my child, you know.
A:	And, uh, the, the thing, you know,
A:	they said, Well, we're giving them isolation time
A:	and this helps them to think.
A:	But a lot of kids,
A:	I mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify him, you know
A:	and,
B:	If, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded?
A:	Uh, that's true.
A:	That's true.
A:	But, no,
A:	I mean, they were, uh, I mean,
A:	I definitely agree with parents.
A:	I think that is a very wrong way to handle, uh, disciplining a child.
A:	Putting them in, I mean, they were, they were they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms.
A:	They didn't call them closets.
A:	But they showed these rooms on, uh, you know, on the news
A:	and, I mean, they looked like a closet to me. You know, with a desk in it, a real small.
A:	But they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms.
A:	I said, now what good does I mean, how is this helping?
A:	I mean, either way. You know, I, I definitely had to disagree with that.
A:	I think that is, that's not the way to handle a child, you know, discipline a child by putting him in a closet
B:	the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that the public school system I want to see changed too.
B:	When I was brought up, if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough, you were going to get spanked.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, then the extreme came in,
B:	and now we can no longer, spank them,
A:	Right.
B:	so we now isolate them.
A:	Yep.
A:	Uh
B:	Okay,
B:	we've swung the pendulum both ways.
B:	Let's find a middle ground.
B:	Instead of, there has to be some sort of discipline,
B:	and there has to be some sort of punishment. Short of physically isolating the child, and short of physically hitting the child.
A:	Right.
A:	Well,
B:	Let's put him into a situation where, okay, you crossed the line, you broke the rule, you're going to have to pay for it.
A:	Right.
B:	But, it's going to tax you physically.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I don't,
B:	Have I mean, instead have them pick up around the school yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school Do something to beautify the school property.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	But you cut, you know,
B:	the, the kid's having to give up his, quote, play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong.
A:	Well,
B:	But he's seeing something constructive come out of it.
A:	um, I have to,
A:	I think one of the positive things, I mean, one of the things that can come out of, uh, is not just discipline, okay?
A:	But, okay,
A:	for instance, one of the things they do at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call, uh, caught being good slips.
A:	And when the kids are in halls and stuff, and if they're being really good, I mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on.
A:	They're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed to,
A:	they get one of these caught being good slips.
A:	And then, when they collect them at the end of each week, they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store,
A:	and then they get to spend these like money.
A:	Well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids, because they're going to be good and try and earn those things, you know, to get the positive part of it.
A:	I mean, they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked.
A:	So, they're definitely going to work towards being good, you know, rather than trying to act up and be bad, you know.
B:	I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself.
B:	We've been too long, there's been too much negative reinforcement.
B:	How much, like, the caught being good slips.
B:	How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's true. I think, I think, really though,
A:	I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked.
A:	But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also.
A:	And it really helps.
A:	And I mean, they, they don't get spanked very often,
A:	but they, they do when they deserve it, you know.
A:	But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.
A:	I mean, I, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child.
A:	But, you know, that's just my personal opinion,
A:	and that's not going to,
A:	I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.
A:	They are never going to let a, a teacher spank a child again.
A:	But I don't think,
A:	I mean, some kids don't get don't get spanked at home
A:	and some kids need to be spanked at home.
A:	I mean, don't you think?
B:	I, most wholeheartedly agree.
A:	But I don't know.
B:	I mean, there's a point of over kill,
B:	but somewhere in, you've got to find an even line.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Well, there's so many parents that say, you can deal with a child without spanking them. Which is true, you can.
A:	But there are times when a child needs to be spanked.
A:	I mean, they do things that they need that.
B:	Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked.
A:	Right. ends with no further
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I guess what, I guess my task.
A:	I usually ride my bike.
A:	I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.
A:	And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.
A:	The stationary bike is, is so, uh,  boring.
B:	Boring.
A:	But I have head phones,
A:	and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room
A:	so I either watch T V, or we have a fish tank,
A:	so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.
A:	If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.
A:	It kind of takes the time away
A:	and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.
A:	But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,
A:	and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.
A:	But it's definitely a task.
B:	You think so?
A:	I can't say that I really enjoy it.
A:	I wish that I did enjoy it more,
A:	but I do it because I have to not because I want to
B:	I bought a stationary bike,
B:	but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And I haven't figured how to get that soft,
B:	and I tried even tying a pillow to it.
B:	But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I love it.
A:	Really?
B:	I just love it.
A:	So is it just women that go there?
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's totally women.
A:	See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.
A:	Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.
A:	You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home
A:	and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.
A:	I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,
A:	but I still don't like other people watching me.
B:	I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess. Uh, feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,
B:	so there's no big deal all the way around,
B:	but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.
B:	Because, hey, you can do what you want.
B:	You're a female,
B:	and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.
A:	That's what,
B:	And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.
A:	Really?
A:	That's, that's great.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	How,
B:	And I love the water aerobics.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did you go on the Barrier
B:	did you see the Great Barrier Reef and, and go snorkeling?
A:	I, I, actually I didn't go diving.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I'm a diver
A:	and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
B:	Oh diving.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh,
A:	no
A:	I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef.
A:	I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.
A:	The coastline was just incredible.
A:	It's huge.
B:	Is it really?
A:	Australia.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh, but,
B:	Did you have shrimp?
B:	I've seen in, you know,
B:	they, they show all this wonderful seafood and, and great big prawns, you know the big shrimp
B:	and,
A:	I don't remember if I had shrimp.
B:	No?
B:	Didn't have shrimp there huh
A:	I don't think so.
B:	I remember food
A:	Oh, I like that too.
A:	But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,
A:	it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Oh you're adventurous.
B:	You went by yourself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Really.
A:	And I was by myself in China too.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh wow.
A:	China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.
A:	But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Was it very expensive?
A:	No,
A:	actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,
A:	no
A:	maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less,
A:	I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare
A:	and,  but this is from Hong Kong,
B:	You're kidding!
B:	No kidding!
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because I was already in Hong Kong
A:	and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there
A:	and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu
A:	and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it.
A:	It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai.
A:	It's just a train ride.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that,
A:	I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things.
A:	It was really,
B:	All for a thousand dollars?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow!
B:	That really surprises me.
A:	Around a thousand.
B:	I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they?
A:	Oh, Japan's ridiculous.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels
A:	but I stayed in,
A:	they were all completely clean,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, they were newly built
A:	and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	Uh, but
A:	yeah,
A:	that was,
A:	I highly recommend that way to go.
A:	If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman,
A:	her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
B:	Oh really.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China
A:	and she just gave me this woman's name to contact
A:	and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then,
A:	Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place
A:	and, uh, I'm, uh, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, uh, word.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I have quite a collection myself
B:	and, you know, I'm a good hunter
B:	and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.
B:	Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes
B:	and, you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I, I feel that its, uh,
A:	I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns,
A:	only outlaws will have guns then.
B:	I believe that.
A:	And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a a gun, a knife, a, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh,
A:	we can handle it
A:	but there's an element that can't.
B:	Yeah
B:	and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons
B:	because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them.
A:	They have got them outgunned.
B:	You know. Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	There was a an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower.
B:	Um.
A:	It had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, uh, would be able, they would be able to put down anything that came at them,
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	that would be,
A:	but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh, a thirty-eight, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's,
A:	Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.
B:	No
B:	it's sure not.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time
A:	and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control
A:	but it was, you had to register as a gun owner,
A:	you didn't have to list your guns,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but you had to have this card,
A:	it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
B:	Um.
A:	and that was the first, uh,
A:	this was twenty years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect.
B:	See in California they,  In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.
A:	Pardon?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You have to sign a, you know,
B:	they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff, before you can buy any big ammunition. Especially for handguns,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	now rifles aren't too bad,
B:	but, you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it, or sign up for it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so.
A:	We lived in Tennessee for awhile
A:	and I bought a pistol there
A:	and there was a fifteen day waiting period.
A:	You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.
B:	Gee.
B:	Gee, that's not a bad idea.
A:	No,
A:	I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh, can make a difference
B:	Yeah.
A:	but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	it is.
A:	So there's, I don't,  think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because,
B:	No.
B:	the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course,
B:	I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway,
B:	I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm,
B:	So.
A:	We, we're getting into capital punishment now
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, you know.
A:	But I, I agree with you there that, uh,
B:	It would definitely be gun control
A:	Yeah.
A:	The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands
A:	but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element.
B:	Myself.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well and they're actually a necessity in life, you know.
A:	Oh yes.
B:	They're not, you know,
B:	not everybody needs a gun
B:	but sooner or later I need one.
B:	You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know,
B:	I'm never had to protect my life or,
A:	Yeah.
B:	well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street
B:	so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects ,
A:	You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh, or your pocket all the time.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No.
B:	So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't,
B:	and I enjoyed my guns.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I have a good time with them
B:	so,
A:	Well I know what, uh,
A:	I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun.
A:	My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but we have several guns around the house
A:	one of these days my grandkids probably.
B:	Probably.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think it's, uh,
A:	you got to have, have the
A:	living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot
A:	but, uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh, they get back up.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I had to explain that to my,
B:	I've got a six year old now
B:	and he, you know,
B:	I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well
B:	they understand now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know I've taken time to teach them
B:	and now the young boy wants to know
B:	and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows
B:	and I took it away from him,
B:	I said now, you know, so he's learning the hard way
B:	but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something
B:	so,
A:	I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me.
A:	This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,
A:	this was a gentleman in his sixties,
B:	Um.
A:	and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two, and taught me how to shoot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We went squirrel hunting
A:	and, and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two
B:	All right.
A:	and, I was probably about twelve at the time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I thought that was the neatest thing
A:	and, of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him
B:	Yeah.
A:	and he let me shoot and showed me how.
B:	All right.
B:	I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well that's about all I,
A:	we agreed pretty well on this I think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think so.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well it's been real nice talking with you.
B:	All right,
B:	have a good one.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye-bye
B:	Do you have children?
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	yes,
A:	I have a daughter.
B:	Do you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	How old is she?
A:	She's only about, uh, uh, a little less than two years old.
B:	Uh, I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, uh, promote a college or anything, huh.
A:	No.
B:	I've got one that's seven and one that's three,
B:	so, we, uh, we started saving,
B:	but that's all.
A:	Yeah
B:	So, do you, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to go to a particular school?
A:	Uh, no, uh, um,
A:	no particular school.
A:	Uh, I think that's really a decision that,
B:	That you are going to let them make.
A:	They,
A:	well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are, they are wanting to do.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and, You know what, not only what you can afford, but what, what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Where did you go to school?
A:	Uh, University of Mississippi.
B:	Oh.
B:	Was that local or, uh,
A:	Uh, well, it was, well, it was within the state.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it, it was not necessarily local, it was,
B:	Yeah.
B:	But I, I mean, so what's, ,
A:	What's the criterion for choosing to go there?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, well, at the time, I was, uh, thinking of going pre med
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med uh, curriculum for the, uh, state institutions.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was choice between there and, uh, a private college that, uh, was a bit more expensive.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	At the time, we really could not afford it
A:	so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It,
A:	uh, I enjoyed it.
B:	So you, did you commute everyday then
B:	or,
A:	No.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	it was a six hour drive.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour
B:	or,
A:	I was, uh, it was like another world.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Basically, it was a, no it was a,
A:	did not get home that often, you know,
A:	and at that age it's, uh, it's kind of, kind of difficult sometimes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Especially, if you have not been away a lot that extended
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, see I did not get my degree until later on,
B:	so I just finished mine a couple of years ago.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier
B:	but,
A:	Uh, that's true.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's like, you know, when I went on to get my, my master's I, uh, basically was, you know, it was where I was at the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and I was trying to work.
A:	But, uh, so when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah.
B:	which group do you work in in T I?
A:	Um, uh, the computer science center.
B:	Oh, uh, where is that at?
A:	Uh, north building.
B:	I see.
B:	How long do you work for T I?
A:	Uh, about three years.
B:	Did you work somewhere else,
B:	like sounds like you got your master's before here
B:	or,
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I have, uh, uh,
A:	no
A:	actually, I mean I came straight from school to here.
B:	I see.
A:	So, cause this was the first, first real job after getting my degree.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	After your master's or after your,
A:	After my master's.
B:	I see.
A:	My undergraduate degree was not in, not in what my master's was.
B:	I see.
A:	So I made a career change basically.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I see.
B:	Well, let's see
B:	I, have not you know,
B:	there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said.
B:	Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that,
B:	so I, I have not really made up my mind, you know, whether to encourage them to go different places
A:	Yeah.
B:	or,
A:	One day I would like to, uh, you know, the, uh,
A:	I, I like the school where I went.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Or the school where I got my master's at, which, which was a different school.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, I liked it almost as well.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but, uh, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there.
B:	Right.
A:	I, you know, think that's
B:	Yeah.
A:	If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. Although I uh, would get quite a break on, on tuition
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, because you went there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students who children of alumnae.
B:	Um.
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	Well certain schools do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	This school does.
A:	So, uh, It's, it ,
B:	Huh.
A:	I, I was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they were,
A:	this was a college night at a, at a high school in Richardson.
A:	And it was,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.
A:	There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, you know, your,  school
B:	Yeah,
B:	your own school,
A:	And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and had heard of, you know, our school. And, and were interested in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, you know, we, uh,
A:	situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that.
A:	That worked out so well.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So did you drum up any interest then
A:	I think so.
A:	I don't know offhand
A:	but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, there,  There was one mother who, uh, came by right, even, before we started, who, who obviously was, uh, very interested in getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something
B:	And that,
A:	and she was wanting some more information.
A:	But she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, a majorette or something. You know, a baton twirler or something
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she was she was, letting us know she, how, how good her daughter was.
A:	She had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she was, had these business cards she was passing out
A:	and it was quite a production.
A:	I think some parents go a little bit overboard.
B:	Yeah
B:	it sounds like it.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
B:	Okay,
B:	well the topic is selecting care for the elderly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future.
B:	What about yourself?
A:	Well, my parents are both in their seventies.
A:	My, my mother and stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies.
A:	And, my, uh, uh, father and stepmother are not in very good health.
A:	So this is something that is,
B:	A concern of yours right now.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
B:	Are, are they living independently, right now?
A:	Yes,
A:	they are.
B:	Oh.
A:	They are.
B:	Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?
A:	Not for them, my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home.
A:	Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms
A:	and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.
A:	And, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care
A:	and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.
B:	Oh, that sounds the ultimate.
A:	Unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.
B:	Well, even at that point, most care can be given at, in the home.
B:	That sound like just an excellent solution.
B:	You must feel real good about that.
A:	Well, I, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.
A:	I, uh, I read a lot
A:	and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes
A:	and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them.
A:	And, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time
A:	and they have, uh,
A:	even the people that are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are incapacitated. Go and, uh, participate in olympics
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here
B:	Right.
A:	You know, so there are a lot of, a lot of activities going on all the time
A:	and this is a nursing home,
A:	it's not a senior citizens home.
A:	So that the people are really, uh,
B:	Really in need of a nursing home.
A:	Right.
A:	They need,  the nursing care,
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, and, but it's a very expensive solution.
B:	Well, it's, you know,
B:	I think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.
B:	It's just a matter of finding, a good home.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able to afford either of those solutions.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that, I think is what is scary,
B:	and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes
B:	and they really can not afford the best.
A:	Right.
A:	And that's right, I, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation
A:	and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,
A:	but when they, the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware,
A:	I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance
A:	and I overheard their conversation.
A:	And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what had happened.
B:	Oh, goodness.
A:	So, I told them he strangled on some chicken
A:	and, uh, they said, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know,
B:	Oh.
A:	and I thought
B:	What a shame,
B:	they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	and then they could have done that well at home.
A:	And then she was upset,
A:	he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his.
A:	He had on a pair, of slacks,
B:	Oh.
A:	and the wife said "these are not his slacks"
A:	and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."
A:	And,
B:	You hear these stories, all the time.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I, this was just something that I was,  I witnessed to.
B:	You happened,
B:	Right.
A:	And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.
A:	And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
B:	Oh.
A:	And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,
A:	and he was definitely,
A:	just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care,
A:	but the family were all talking about, uh, putting him in another home.
A:	They said he will not go back to that one.
B:	Well, good.
B:	Good,
B:	I'm glad they have a solution. To do that,
A:	I'm glad they the option.
B:	yes.
B:	I know.
A:	I, I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford
A:	and there were not, there was no choice.
B:	Exactly.
B:	My, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be seven, eight years,
B:	and, uh, and, uh,  It's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.
A:	Oh, my.
A:	Um.
B:	As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from,  from people who have been independent all their lives.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like this was a really neat vital woman
B:	and you get in a nursing home
B:	and the first thing that happens you have to share your, your whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your life.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And oh I, I do not know what the answer is,
B:	but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there
B:	and it, I think it does,
B:	a lot of it goes down to just money. And family support,
A:	That's right.
B:	uh, if you, you know, have family that, uh, you can live with.
A:	Visits everyday.
B:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	I, I really,
B:	I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know.
B:	You would do your research
B:	and you would go visit.
A:	Visit,
A:	right.
B:	And, uh, hopefully, they would have, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.
A:	Right.
B:	Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit
A:	Suspicious.
B:	right.
A:	You know, I, I, my, I remember my, my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died
A:	and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time,
A:	but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything,
A:	she really was not aware of what she was doing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I I can remember she had several strokes
A:	and the nursing home was right next to a hospital
A:	and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days.
A:	And it was, she was, it was just like keeping something.
B:	Well, we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system.
B:	Um, I, I really have been pleased with Plano.
B:	I have a child who, uh,
B:	my son is learning disabled,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into.
A:	Now, is he the elementary school?
B:	He's in elementary school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he's not severely learning disabled.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you know, he just, He's being helped.
A:	But he is being helped.
B:	He, he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they recently released him from, resource, which I'm, I was thrilled,
A:	Oh, great.
B:	I really was.
B:	I, I just thought that was so neat, that they got him over that hump.
B:	And, um, he's in the Herman Method of Reading.
B:	I don't know if you're, familiar with that.
A:	No,
A:	that's something new to me.
A:	I'm,
B:	It is something new,
B:	and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters.
A:	Oh.
B:	Um,
A:	I think I read about that in the paper.
B:	It's wonderful.
A:	Doctor Haggard is, is heading that up.
B:	Yes,
B:	and it's wonderful.
B:	He didn't have a problem with reading.
B:	As a matter of fact, he's reading on level.
B:	The problem was his spelling.
B:	And, you know, in, in watching the way he has struggled,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's interesting, because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had, that was ignored.
A:	Oh.
B:	And,
A:	Right,
A:	so you worked, you learned how to solve your problems on your own.
B:	That's right.
B:	And, and so it's, you know, it's not an intelligence problem.
B:	It's just a problem with learning.
A:	Has, has he had this since kindergarten,
A:	or is this something that maybe learning phonetics,
A:	and then he just didn't learn the right way?
B:	Well, you know, it's funny.
B:	When, um, when he was in first grade, he had trouble with, with spelling,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I would say to the teacher, you know, it's amazing.
B:	He will be able to,
B:	you'll say to him, spell cat,
B:	and, you know, he'll say C A T,
B:	and then he would go to write it,
B:	and he would write C O T.
A:	Okay.
B:	And I kept saying to the teacher, something is wrong here.
B:	Something is wrong here.
A:	You're right, right.
B:	And the teacher kept saying, oh, he has a May birthday.
B:	He's just immature.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, second grade it was,
B:	I will,
B:	these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, I went up there,
B:	and I, I requested a conference and, because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy.
A:	Good,
A:	good,
A:	that's great for parents to be involved.
B:	Well, I was,
B:	and I, and I went up there the second week of school
B:	and I said, you know, something is wrong,
B:	and thank God the the head teacher, the team leader, was a special education major.
A:	Oh, how great.
B:	It was, it was
B:	and, She had picked it up,
A:	So she, she was able to zero in.
B:	yep,
A:	Oh.
B:	she had already picked it up.
B:	And she said, you know, we, we were going to call you if you hadn't called us.
B:	We think there's a learning disability
B:	and we think he needs to be tested immediately, because, you know, once the first report card comes in, they, have all these people being tested,
A:	Huh.
B:	and she said, I think we can get him real fast.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And sure enough, they tested him
B:	and, you know, he qualified for, for the help,
B:	and it's been great,
B:	and I, and I thank God I'm here, because I, I know I have a sister who has the other extreme.
B:	She has a, a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted,
B:	and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her.
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, and to me that's the same thing.
B:	It's, it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored, this poor gifted child is being ignored.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	but that's something that parents, I think, are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child.
B:	That's true.
A:	So, because, that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home
B:	That's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but learning disability, unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it real difficult
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and this is, this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that, that, uh, you do have government money to fund, the kinds of programs that these students need,
B:	Yes.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem, they test kids before they take them,
B:	Exactly,
B:	and, They don't take them,
A:	and if they're a behavior problem, they're out.
B:	that's right.
A:	That,
A:	and, and, uh, this is kind of a rejection type of thing,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and we get it even at our level in, in,
A:	I work a nine ten school,
A:	and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the, uh, parochial and and, uh, private schools
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they come in
A:	and their attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and proceed to prove it.
B:	Really,
B:	really.
A:	So I, I really hate that for them.
A:	I, I, would rather they not have that attitude,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but that's,
B:	Well, when comparing test scores,
B:	I know recently I was in a discussion
B:	and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools,
A:	Right.
B:	and that was one of the points that I made, is that you're not comparing apples to apples.
A:	That's right.
B:	You know, you can't say, um, you know, I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and, into a private school. And, um, which is, which is too bad.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But on the other hand, I, I can't necessarily blame them, you know, they, they are a private school
A:	No.
B:	and they, can do whatever they want.
A:	That's right,
A:	they can be selective,
A:	right.
B:	And they they,
B:	that's right,
B:	they have the ability to be selective.
B:	But you can't say then, well, public schools are, are not as good.
A:	Right.
B:	Perhaps they are, because they're, they're,
A:	If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them, and then compared them to the to the private school group, then I think you would have a more equitable way.
B:	You're right.
A:	And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here.
A:	In, in, in, uh, honesty, the kids in Japan are, they have to try out to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going to get into,
B:	Oh, really?
A:	and then after, uh,
A:	and if, if you only,
A:	the, in fact, they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if they don't, then when they reach a certain age, they just, that's the end of their schooling.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and, uh, they don't ever really go on.
A:	It's only their top ones that go on, like ours do.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, and, uh, so that, that creates a problem.
A:	And, and you can't compare, because they go so many more hours.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.
B:	Right,
B:	well, you see that with the foreigners that come here.
A:	That's right.
B:	Um, I, I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had to be the best,
B:	and they put off all social life, all everything, you know.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
B:	Well, is that good?
B:	Yes,
B:	the child is very bright,
B:	but on the other hand, I feel like my children, who are kind of middle of the road, have, are more rounded, you know.
A:	Better coping skills.
A:	Yes.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure,
B:	I think it's real important to have friends.
B:	I think it's real important to play sports.
B:	I think it's real important to be part of a team.
A:	Right.
B:	And so that's why I said, their childhood is extremely different from mine.
B:	We didn't do all that you know.
A:	Right.
B:	We certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do. Um,
A:	Well, and you don't, you don't see the parents, uh, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,
B:	No.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	it's strictly stick to the educational,
A:	and it's interesting to see them as they get older, uh, then that is the type of adult they are.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
A:	Okay?
B:	Yes.
A:	Well, this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend.
B:	Oh are you really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Where is it going to be?
A:	Down at Lake Texoma lodge.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yes,
A:	this is one that's, uh, the Baker family reunion
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and this has been going on at least, uh, I would say, at least twenty-five years or thirty,  something like that.
B:	Oh, that's  marvelous.
A:	Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	First time, I, I married into the family,
A:	and the first time I went was about fifty-seven, I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, this one has been well organized
A:	and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood,
A:	and now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be.
A:	Very important, because, uh, you'll start losing people if it's too far to go.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have factions, when it's one part,
B:	we, I have one reunion on my mother's side,
B:	and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas, some people come,
B:	and if it's elsewhere, other people come
A:	Yeah.
B:	we never get them at both of them
A:	Never get them at both places,
B:	it seems like,
B:	so I think we need to find a new place
A:	Right.
A:	Well, listen, they've, uh, they've had this one,
A:	well it just,
A:	of course, over the years it has, uh, built up as far as the organization is concerned
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but now they, uh, have a golf tournament on the Saturday.
B:	Um.
A:	And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.
B:	Oh, that's a neat idea.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, everyone, uh, they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge,
A:	and everyone brings in food
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant,
A:	and uh it really, uh, has worked out.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How many people, Jim, are involved?
A:	Uh, generally, uh, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.
B:	Wow.
A:	I think normal's about sixty or seventy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I guess, um, ours probably isn't that big.
B:	Our family is dwindling, for one thing.
A:	Oh
B:	And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
A:	Oh.
B:	I just have one aunt and my family.
B:	So sometimes when these other families get together, they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we're kind of off on the sidelines.
B:	But it does remind us that we have family and roots.
A:	Right.
B:	So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, our family reunion started out my wife
A:	and I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and now we go, our children go,
A:	and our grandchildren are going now.
B:	Oh that's great.
A:	So it's, uh, wound up that, uh, we're the old folks now.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But, um, they have various organized,
A:	they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, uh, to pitch,
A:	and they organize a baseball game for the kids
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and several people bring boats,
A:	and there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon,
A:	so it it's a full day.
B:	So there's lots to do.
A:	Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some just come in for Saturday
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, it, uh, has worked out quite well,
A:	and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	that's true.
B:	Well, that's neat.
B:	I think, think they're really fun.
B:	We go to mine regularly,
B:	and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple,
B:	and he has a large family,
B:	so it's, it's fun when we go to that one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia,
A:	and I think we've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that,
A:	so, That's just too far away.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	that, that is a problem with the distance.
B:	The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's just too much for all of them,  all of that group to travel.
A:	It's an,  all day drive just to get to this area.
B:	Right.
B:	But then we have the same attitude when it's out, there, although this year we're going out.
B:	They're going to have it at Fort Davis
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have,
A:	each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.
A:	We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together. And it takes a lot of planning,  and assembling of stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And choose,  some place that everybody's going to like as far as food and all that
A:	Right.
A:	That's correct.
B:	That's a heavy burden.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is,
A:	I tell you.
A:	I don't really care for her to be president again.
B:	No
A:	But that is, uh, it's, it's a lot of work,
A:	but it's a lot of fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We've enjoyed it,
A:	and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma.
B:	Well, I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it's, it's good for kids to know that they have other family.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and this year they're all excited.
A:	The show this weekend,
A:	this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	my two grandsons and one of their cousins are, are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know, in jeans and t-shirts and such.
B:	Oh, what fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it's, uh, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Probably lots of laughs.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	there have been some really wild shows put on there.
A:	They, uh, really get, uh, into it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along.
B:	Ours, ours is still kind of loosely organized,
B:	and the same people usually get stuck with doing it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well,  Oh, that generally happens.
B:	And,  they do it as a labor of love.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, the officer idea is a good idea.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well we've, uh, had various things over the years, uh, to raise funds for it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and again, it's not, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh they've come up with,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	they've tried passing the hat,
A:	and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds,
A:	and, uh some people do
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some people don't
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it's not fair that everybody not contribute,
A:	Excuse me. But, um, anyway, that's the family reunion story.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Bye.
A:	Been nice talking to you.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
B:	Well, I am, uh, the product of, uh, I think as much the changing roles of women as anyone,
B:	my mother, uh,
B:	we come from a,
B:	my mother and I were, uh, really, first generation divorce in our family.
A:	Yes.
B:	My, uh, mother was divorced in nineteen, uh, fifty-seven, when I was seven years old.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, was, I was the first one, of anyone that, that anyone had ever known, to have a divorce.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course, now fifty percent divorces in the United States, uh,
B:	my mother, uh, was treated very badly, uh, in a, by a lot of people, family members, um, especially from my father's side of the family,
B:	and also, uh, uh, uh, we were, uh, ostracized by his family, uh, basically just, you know, uh, we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And, they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the, was the cause of the reason for the split up, even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce.
A:	Oh, mercy.
B:	Uh, it was always my mother's fault, she was not, uh, sufficient, you know, she just was not good enough.
B:	What was wrong with her, was she not attractive enough, did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest.
B:	It was that kind of an attitude.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's too bad.
B:	So, uh,
B:	yeah
B:	it was too bad,
B:	it was really rough.
A:	Um, um, that's sad.
A:	It really is.
B:	Uh, so, you know, that's so changing,
B:	some of the changing roles of women in that respect, I have been a product of.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I think that there are people that, I think that, uh,
B:	I was I was first generation going to college in my family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, first, my mother had always had a quote career, but always a career as a, uh, uh, in a secretarial position.
B:	She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in Des Moines, Iowa.
A:	That's, that's wonderful.
B:	She was a secretary to, uh, uh, the to, uh, a circuit court judge, federal judge.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him.
B:	So, that was a really high, high status position.
A:	Well, that's wonderful.
B:	She made over thirty thousand,  a year.
A:	That speaks,  well of your mother.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	she a real hard
A:	She had high standards.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back, you know.
A:	Oh, bless her heart.
B:	But, uh, so I went to college and now since have completed two master's degrees
B:	and I am the director of music in a church.
B:	Um, and but it's interestingly enough, I am still, everyday, confronted with,
A:	Challenges.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Challenges that have to do with my sex.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, for instance, uh, well, you know, I am just not taken as seriously, you know, at professions, as many of the as many of the men who are doing the same job I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman, they expect me to be more motherly,
B:	they question my authority more, uh, than they ever would a man.
B:	And I have experience with this, because I work at both, both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So I am pretty, I am pretty pretty I mean, I am pretty aware of what goes on uh, in the church.
A:	Surely.
B:	So, basically that's, that's,
B:	well I am done talking.
B:	Do you want to talk?
A:	Well, I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well, uh, Nickie.
A:	And I can, uh, relate to that, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I think it's, it's the image that the woman has and, uh, in the world, as, uh, the lesser of the two.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, always.
A:	And, uh, I think things are changing,
A:	but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to, like it to take.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think we are progressing at a snail's pace,
B:	Indeed.
A:	but we are progressing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that's the main point is that we are going ahead.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think that, uh, in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, men, uh, have, a lot of them have, uh, come around and have seen, the error of their ways.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we have to, uh, face that reality also.
B:	I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change, why they can not bend. I mean, why they can not just accept, you know, competent women,
B:	I, I have never been able to understand that.
B:	I guess it's fear
B:	I mean what ,
A:	It could be, if they are they are not sure of themselves.
B:	Sure.
A:	The ones that, uh, go along with that, they are sure of themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they know that they can, uh, you know, uh, be on the same level.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they do not have any, uh, ego, uh, problems that they are fighting.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think that we are going to be, uh, on par with them in salary and in recognition, in the long term.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and I, what I would like to see happen futuristically, is what we are discussing, is that yes, uh, we each have our, uh, jobs in life, and that we should recognize that. And that we should support each other.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think our problems would be fewer, if we supported each other. And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser, because we are equal.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Men have a lot of trouble with that though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They, in their, in their own peer relationships, they do not treat themselves equal,
B:	and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals.
B:	They are, they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower.
B:	Uh, it just seems that, it seems, it seems that they are more comfortable that way.
B:	And I do not know if that's, I mean, that's, it's a militaristic point of view I guess, you know,
B:	somebody can not be colonel
B:	and everybody else is infantry,
B:	but it's just really interesting to me.
B:	I am married to a wonderful man, you know, who treats me very, you know, with a, with as,
B:	I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time.
B:	But, when he gets angry, it's always over control issues, it's always over power issues, it's never over, you know, it's always, you said you were going to do something
B:	and you did not do it. As if he is the boss
B:	and I am the, you know, and I am the slave.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And it,
B:	those are the only, only issues we ever fight about.
B:	I think it's just, I think it's just difficult for men to, uh, to accept women equally,
B:	even if they want to, they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss
B:	Uh, dictator, dictatorships are real efficient.
A:	Well, I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us.
B:	Um.
A:	And, uh, the women when they are married, they are to be subjective to their husbands.
B:	Um.
A:	And I believe that strongly.
B:	Um.
A:	And, uh, but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are, with what the subject matter is.
B:	Um.
A:	And I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, and I think that can happen in a very wonderful way.
B:	Huh.
A:	And if we, men and women, would do as the Bible said, that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Can you picture that?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, if your husband did that to you, and you did that to your husband, you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's true.
A:	And, uh, that's really the, the divine answer, and, and the right answer
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, uh, that would be a beautiful relationship.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it would be.
A:	And I think there are some people that have done that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I have seen it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's, it's just marvelous,
A:	and I am just in awe to see this,
A:	Um, I don't,
A:	I am only twenty-eight
A:	and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes.
A:	I don't, I have never visited any of them
A:	and, uh, I don't think I've ever even been in one.
A:	Have you?
B:	Um, actually I have, um, I've, I've been in them but, um, just visiting
B:	and, uh, we used to when we were like in, in our teen ages
B:	we'd go on Sundays and visit, you know, the older people.
B:	But, um, I have an elderly grandma that lives with us.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she's lived with us for like five years.
B:	So I kind of know how it is to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home
B:	or, um, like we, I mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile
B:	and
A:	And it, it takes a lot of care
A:	like twenty-four hours a day someone, has to be, Well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's
A:	His grandmother too and they're, that her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.
A:	He, he has, he's recently retired
A:	and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke
A:	and, and all the other children are working or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're all my parents age.
A:	And, uh, so he's got, you know, his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day.
A:	They have a day care two days a week.
A:	They call it senior citizen day care.
A:	But she goes in the senior citizen center.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	So he gets a break two days a week
A:	but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired,
A:	and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
B:	Right.
A:	But he refuses to consider any other,
A:	I don't,
B:	To put her in a rest home?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and is that how your parents feel
A:	or,
B:	Um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home.
B:	So it's kind of, uh,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I mean, I don't, I don't think my parents would
B:	but she is getting pretty bad
B:	like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed
B:	and, it's,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my mom has to take care of her pretty much
B:	so it gets,
B:	I don't know.
B:	It's, it's a hard decision,
B:	but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally
A:	I know at this,
A:	I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either, you know.
A:	But I, I really feel bad for the people I see not very,
A:	I'm not really, really experienced
A:	but like I said I just have that one family,
A:	and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now
A:	and, than he thought it would be.
A:	But,
B:	When he retired?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters
A:	and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone.
A:	And,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months
B:	and then he has her for three months.
A:	Oh, well, that's great.
B:	So that, that works out good.
A:	That's a good idea.
A:	We ought to,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I don't know what they're going to do.
A:	It's really not my family.
A:	It's my fiancee's
A:	so I don't, I can't say much.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either
A:	and I wonder, I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children
A:	so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for. You know,
B:	Really?
A:	and I'm, I,
A:	that's fine with me.
A:	my fiancee and I both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever.
A:	If
A:	You know what I mean?
A:	We feel like, it's our responsibility,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I feel like I would never put them in a home.
A:	But I wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You think about it
A:	and it's really,
A:	I don't know.
A:	This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.
B:	You think?
B:	I, I I'm not really familiar with how other countries,
A:	And, It's really more of a, um, like a respect issue that the older, older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people
A:	and, and they really seem as wise
A:	and, and in this country nobody really, Yeah, nobody really pays attention
B:	They're seen as senile
A:	and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way
A:	and nobody respects the traditions.
A:	And, you know, it's I,
A:	I'm not saying that I do either
A:	but you know, it's just funny
B:	Right.
A:	and, and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security
A:	and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.
B:	Right.
A:	They don't have any,
A:	they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know because we're all going to get old someday.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know.
A:	And so it's a, it's kind of a depressing topic though.
A:	How old are you?
B:	Um, I'm twenty.
A:	So it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it really is
B:	but, and she, she drives us
A:	Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel,
A:	and then I'll respond.
B:	All right.
B:	Well, I'm, uh, I'm very guilty of, of not doing my part with recycling, I'm afraid.
B:	We, um, recently moved here from North Carolina,
B:	and they had curbside recycling,
B:	and it was very easy to, you know, to put everything out there,
B:	but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to, to take things where take things where they belong.
A:	Well, how long have you been here?
B:	Well, we've been here since January,
B:	so we, we still feel very new,
A:	Well,
B:	but, uh it's working up to a year now,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's a good excuse.
A:	You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We've been here probably two and a half years,
A:	and, and we didn't recycle at all before we came
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I think we're doing well.
A:	We, we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, where do you take those things?
A:	Well, the, um, glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart.
A:	They have, um, in behind Walmart they have bins
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we usually save up our cans and, and change them in for money.
B:	Well, where do you do that,
B:	because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I didn't know where to take them.
A:	Um, there's a place on Parker Road, um,
A:	it's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart.
A:	I think there's a, a service station there.
A:	There's usually a semi truck that has a, a person there that will weigh them
A:	and, Now they aren't worth much right now,
B:	Oh.
A:	but it's better than nothing
B:	Yeah.
A:	so
B:	Better than nothing,
B:	right.
A:	and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now,
A:	and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I,
B:	it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, you know it's coming in a couple of months,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, I think it's been delayed.
B:	but
A:	I think it was originally scheduled for February,
A:	but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with from what I've read in, you know, the mail that we get
B:	Oh.
B:	Right.
A:	and I can't wait for that,
A:	that will be easy.
A:	I get tired of newspaper littering the garage
B:	Yeah,
B:	it gets to be a bit much to haul it off,
B:	but.
A:	I feel guilty we don't recycle our, our milk containers because they seem like a big waste.
B:	Well, they, yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway
A:	Yeah
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah,
A:	they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can
B:	Right.
A:	so, I'll be glad when the bins do come,
A:	and I think that's when I'll, I'll start doing the plastic, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was real easy with the bins,
B:	it really was,
B:	it was just no effort at all, um, no more trouble than taking out the garbage,
B:	so, um,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've gotten used to washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and things like that,
B:	Right.
A:	it's not that big of a deal,
A:	and it's nicer to just throw them out,
A:	but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, how much do you earn on the cans,
B:	I, I didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for,
A:	Oh, when we first were, were here, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So it's gone down.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
A:	which is understandable,
A:	I think, more people are are recycling.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's something we, we don't really make any effort to,
A:	and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, you know, the, the cans
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that was kind of fun,
A:	but we haven't done that for a long time
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
B:	Well, that sounds like a pretty good project.
A:	Well, the boys think it's fun, plus you get your exercise
A:	and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest
A:	so
B:	Oh.
A:	but.
B:	Well, I'll have to keep myself and, and get on it.
B:	My neighbor across the street, um, is so careful about recycling,
B:	and so I keep telling myself, I'll, I'll get it organized,
B:	but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.
A:	Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month
A:	and that will spur you on,
A:	so
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	I won't have any excuse then,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	All right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, Trying
B:	Thinking about it, anyway
A:	that's all you can do
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, Well, um, have you,
A:	so.
B:	do they time this thing for us,
B:	or do we,
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	you can do it as long as you want.
A:	They, you know,
A:	if it's been long enough, five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording
B:	You can't chat all day, huh
A:	So we can say good-bye now.
B:	Okay.
A:	It was good talking to you,
A:	and maybe we'll get on line again.
B:	Okay.
A:	Thanks, Sherry.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, do you have any pets?
B:	Yes
B:	I do.
B:	I have a dog named Grisly, who's a ten year old, uh, mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I have a pair of box turtles.
A:	Oh,
A:	I used to have box turtles, um, well, years ago, when I was growing up
B:	Yeah,
A:	I, I really like them.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I do, too.
B:	Lucky and Spot, that's their names
A:	Oh.
B:	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,
B:	and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle, and always has his nose all around my turtle box,
B:	so do you have any pets now?
A:	Yes,
A:	um, we have one dog, a Bichon Frise.
A:	Um, our friends in Houston bred the dogs.
A:	I had never heard of them
B:	No,
B:	I haven't either.
A:	they're, um, they're all white
A:	and they're small, and, um, and fluffy,
A:	they don't shed.
A:	I guess they're distantly related to a poodle,
A:	but they're not very well known in this country,
A:	and they're not, um, high strung or over bred um.
B:	Oh.
B:	And how big do they get.
A:	Ours is, uh, on the small end,
A:	and she's about ten pounds,
A:	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	and they love people, um, and kids
A:	and that was something we were looking for, um,
A:	our, our love is Golden Retrievers,
A:	and that's what we had intended to get in Houston,
A:	but we had a small yard and a pool
A:	and knowing how they love to dig and love the water, um, and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
B:	the water,
B:	yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, uh, we ended up getting this,
A:	and, uh, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think
B:	Oh.
A:	now he wants a, a good size dog
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well, we've got a good size dog,
B:	and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature Dachshund,
B:	and I miss having a little one you know, around.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The kind you have sounds very interesting, though.
A:	Well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs.
A:	We've, uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and, and bred them.
A:	They had five litters of puppies,
A:	and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because, um,
B:	And how do you spell that breed?
A:	It's B I C H O N F R I S E.
B:	F R I S E.
B:	And how do you pronounce that?
A:	Bichon Frise.
B:	Okay.
B:	I'm writing it out phonetically,
A:	Yeah.
A:	They're, uh,
A:	and they don't shed
A:	so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with allergies,
B:	Yes,
A:	and they love people,
A:	and they're,
B:	Do they bark a lot?
A:	Um, no,
A:	not really.
A:	Ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house.
A:	We used to swap back and forth dogs.
A:	they have three dogs.
A:	They had a Cockapoo, and, and two Bichons um,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, now it's funny.
A:	She's, she's a good watch dog
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if there's, she'll bark that way,
A:	but she also talks a lot,
A:	she um, has a definite personality
B:	Yes.
A:	and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because she doesn't want to be left. Um.
B:	Oh.
B:	Does she ever mess in the house?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	and they're, um, they're very smart dogs.
A:	The circuses in Europe used to use them um, for the acts.
B:	Oh.
A:	They, uh, oh, they'll dance on their hind legs each
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, gee.
A:	um, but they're very easy to train
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	And about how much are they?
A:	Well, they range,
A:	I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper.
A:	They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think which I thought was a lot.
B:	And how about the, And how about the person in, uh, Houston?
A:	Well, she's no longer breeding them
B:	Oh.
A:	but, um, because her dogs, um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter,
A:	and, uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, um, pets, you know they weren't, weren't show quality.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Just pets,
B:	Yes,
B:	that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of
B:	we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl.
B:	We did that every weekend,
A:	Oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time.
B:	Yes,
B:	and it's very expensive.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, but she might have some contacts here,
A:	I know I know that the dog's grandmother, um, was from Plano,
B:	Oh, that's where I live,
A:	Oh, that's where I live, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm at Coit and Legacy ...
B:	So, what do you think about it?
A:	Well, I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, well, if there is a problem, what should we do about it?
B:	Right
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess that's so.
A:	Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America?
B:	Um, uh, I think there's some problems,
B:	but they're not really big ones.
B:	I think that, um, in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be.
B:	That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America.
B:	It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that.
A:	Okay.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	I was, I was wondering what your response would be.
A:	I'm a first generation American.
B:	Okay.
A:	So I'm, from immigrant parents Or an immigrant mother anyway.
B:	Uh, where did you come from?
B:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	so where did your parents come from?
A:	Uh, Poland.
B:	Okay.
B:	And,
A:	And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's interesting that, you know, with the topic I think I agree with you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	There needs to be more of an open policy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor, you know, for the railroad, Transatlantic Railroad
A:	and, our Irish came and, you know, built the towns and, did labor.
B:	Yep.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But what do you think,
A:	are you from Texas
A:	or,
B:	I'm from Pennsylvania.
A:	Pennsylvania.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that will be interesting.
B:	Right,
B:	and, uh, a lot of,
A:	Because we have just, had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, I'm from Texas and have become citizens now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you think about that?
B:	Um, I think that's all right.
B:	I, um,
B:	at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing.
B:	Do you have an opinion about it?
A:	Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to?
B:	No,
B:	okay.
A:	Because Texan philosophy is a little different.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China.
B:	And, um, you know he, um, got a green card is, and is in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always nice to the Chinese government, and all that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he was always on pretty good terms with them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well we,
B:	But, um, their,
B:	my sister just had a baby
B:	and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing.
B:	And it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem.
B:	It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here.
A:	Oh, well, then you have first in the experience on immigration.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that is interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I wonder, you know, even with those that were involved with Tienamen's Square.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, did we really protect them?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, and I think that's pretty crazy, because I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China
B:	so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can.
A:	That is true.
A:	That is true.
A:	Well, what do you think about,
B:	Yeah.
A:	we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population that has been brought in.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What do you think about that?
B:	Um,
A:	And these are not the brightest.
B:	See, these are refujees, you mean?
A:	I mean we we're talking boat people.
B:	Okay.
B:	Right,
B:	okay.
A:	We have a lot of boat people in Texas.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, um, I don't have any problem with that. Um,
A:	You're a true liberal heart-to-heart.
A:	Good for you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess so
A:	I was ready for a fight on this one
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	No,
A:	I agree because,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, interesting, my, when my daughter was in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese
B:	Yeah.
A:	and with his limited English they found out, you know, that, she was in student council,
A:	and they found out that he was a medical doctor,
B:	All right,
B:	so, we started recording already?
A:	Uh, I guess,
A:	I don't know.
A:	It's the first time I've made a phone call on it.
B:	Oh, so you pressed one?
A:	Right.
B:	Okay.
B:	So, I guess we're supposed to start talking.
B:	Uh what kind of books do you read?
A:	I read, uh, a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, uh some Danielle Steel.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My aunt got me hooked on those
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I,
B:	So it's mostly all novels?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're all novels.
B:	Okay.
A:	I'll read some, uh, classic, too.
B:	Oh, like what?
A:	Uh, like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck.
A:	I'll, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like that.
B:	I like Steinbeck a lot.
A:	A, A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites.
B:	I have never read a lot of Faulkner.
A:	Oh, and this, this is more of a play or something that, that it was from, that, that I saw
A:	and I read the book from that.
B:	Oh, cool
A:	And, by the way, my name's Bill.
A:	I'm from North Carolina
B:	I'm Doug,
B:	I'm from Pennsylvania.
A:	Uh, I,
A:	let's see.
A:	What kind of books do you like to read?
B:	Uh, well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, uh, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones.
B:	And, like, I don't really like the, you know, six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that.
A:	I really have to be in the mood.
B:	Right?
A:	I, I read one, like maybe once a year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not as,
B:	No,
B:	like, I like, say, uh, Richard Broudigan a lot. Uh,
A:	I've never read anything by him.
B:	Okay.
B:	He's, uh, he's dead now,
B:	but he was really a pretty amazing writer.
B:	He wrote books that were, like, pretty short and pretty easy to read, you know, like written at a third grade level or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny.
B:	Like, He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.
A:	Okay.
B:	So that's, anyway,
B:	and, uh, I read a lot of non fiction books, too.
B:	Uh, let's see,
A:	I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and, and that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I found that real interesting.
A:	I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now.
A:	And that was on T V.
B:	Now what's that?
A:	It was, uh, during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And, uh, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, uh, Morocco.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a, kind of a crazy man, you know.
B:	Yeah
A:	Surprised me.
A:	I had no idea that he was like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What, how crazy?
A:	Well, just like some, one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle,
A:	and it should be a grizzly bear because
B:	Oh,
A:	you, you know, like the grizzly and stuff like that.
A:	So it's,
A:	I saw the movie
A:	and that's what made me want to read the book.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Candice Bergen was in the movie.
A:	I'm a real big fan of hers
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Cool,
B:	see, I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like, I like to read some of the philosophy stuff.
B:	Like,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, let's see,
B:	and even like reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in,
B:	like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that,
B:	It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that.
A:	I'm fascinated by that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm fascinated by that.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yep.
A:	That,
A:	and, and, uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like,
A:	I'm kind of a doubting Thomas
A:	and I like to read stuff like that.
A:	Some of it really freaks me out
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Right,
B:	definitely
B:	Uh,
A:	And I like to read, uh, I like to read some self help books like, uh,
A:	I read DIANETICS once, once I got past all the gibberish on it.
B:	Uh, did you like it?
A:	It was okay.
A:	It, it, it, it took me a while to really get into it.
A:	It, it didn't help me that much
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I see.
A:	But, uh, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in your ways.
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh, then I,
A:	one real interesting book I read recently was, when I was looking for a job,
A:	I read, HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED
A:	and, it, it had real good tips
A:	and it,
A:	and I got the job that I wanted by applying the, the methods that, that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or who you think will be doing well this year.
B:	Uh, well, where I'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
B:	and, course, we have Duke University that was the national champions last year,
B:	so I'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year.
B:	They have a lot of the same players back.
A:	Are we talking about, is this the N B A?
B:	No,
B:	this is college basketball.
A:	This is college, College, okay
B:	Right.
B:	We have like Carolina, and Duke, and Georgia Tech, and N C State, teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, hopefully we'll have a good year.
B:	I don't really follow the N B A very closely.
A:	And see that's probably all, all I saw.
A:	I, we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas
A:	and there's so many colleges and universities in Texas, we haven't really followed them too much
A:	and none of them are our, our alma mater
A:	so, that seems to help.
B:	Do you like professional basketball?
A:	Uh, I, I follow it especially around the playoffs,
A:	so, course, I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz,
A:	and the Mailman or Karl Malone was, you know, pretty big thing
A:	and, the Lakers have always been amazing to watch.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks.
A:	They've not had any good seasons for a long time, and have a lot of problems with, with Tarpley
A:	and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it
A:	but,
B:	Well, that's an up and coming team, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I hope they do something.
A:	They need to
A:	or they're not going to have any of the team left at all.
B:	That's somebody you can get behind and, be patient.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Kind of like the Cowboys I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, coming out of it this year.
A:	We'll see if it's held on.
B:	But, I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again.
A:	The Bulls?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They'll probably be pretty good.
A:	Course, the Celtics are always really, really good, too, with their players.
B:	That's true.
A:	Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the, the N B A players playing on the Olympic team.
B:	That's true,
B:	it will be interesting.
A:	So,
B:	It will certainly be different
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know, how close I'll follow them, though.
A:	And the season hasn't started yet.
A:	I'm usually more the end of the season person,
A:	and we need to talk about baseball
A:	and so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, my Atlanta Braves.
A:	Well,
B:	Well, I really do, uh, you know,
B:	the basketball season's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks.
A:	It's,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's a long season.
A:	It is, it is,
A:	and that's why I've,
A:	I guess my mind went blank.
A:	It's like last season was so long ago
A:	and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, this wasn't a good subject,
A:	but, We'll see how our predictions come true.
B:	It's a little early.
B:	We definitely will.
A:	Okay,
A:	it's good talking to you.
B:	Good to talk to you.
A:	All righty,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, I guess my personal opinion, I, I don't mind paying taxes necessarily.
A:	I, I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, sometimes when I hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, uh, I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them, uh,
A:	and that's all tax money.
A:	When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much, it's just billions of dollars
A:	that's, I think is just being thrown away.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	And then when you read about that they're spending all the money on, you know, these studies that have no relevance whatsoever, that kind of ticks you off, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I, I, I tend to agree with that
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm not really into what they're doing per se,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think there's just too many, too many levels of bureaucracy.
B:	I think it can be, can be managed by less, uh, less levels.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, I know any time there's, there's a big, uh, budget cut, you know,
A:	I work with the state,
A:	and any time there's, there is a budget cut or crunches, it's always the small guy that, that gets hurt.
B:	Right.
A:	It's never the, uh, the person that's making a hundred thousand there.
A:	It's always the person that's making the least amount,
A:	and uh, and sometimes we're running around there.
B:	Right.
A:	I see these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having meetings.
A:	I, I really don't know what they do.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that.
B:	Do you,
B:	I mean, is that since,
B:	I mean do you have them every year?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	every year.
A:	And, uh, still, you wind up meeting people you, uh, you never knew you were related to. Let alone
B:	Yeah.
A:	And,
B:	Well, I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and then when we do, and everyone finally does get together,
B:	it is like after the, you know,
A:	Okay,
A:	so you have eight children.
A:	Um, what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together.
B:	Oh, we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, bicycling, uh, going to the park, um, some time watching V C R movies um, generally cheap things
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we know how that goes.
A:	Uh, with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.
B:	That's right.
A:	Well, that's fun.
A:	So, um, let's see, uh,
A:	some of the things we do together as a family, we like to play games a lot,
A:	and you may think this is funny,
A:	but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek,
A:	and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that is so fun.
A:	The kids just get a crack out of that.
A:	Um, we like, we do like to go to the park, too you, uh, like your family.
A:	Um, we don't do a lot of vacationing.
A:	Have you taken a lot of vacations together
A:	or,
B:	Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and
B:	We get an occasional one or two day thing
A:	Oh.
B:	but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.
A:	Oh, now where do they live?
B:	In Arizona.
A:	Oh, so that's a bit of a drive for you there.
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, so you like to go there for the holidays
A:	and.
B:	Oh, we don't go very often for holidays.
B:	Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh, what are the ages of your kids then?
B:	They range from twenty-four to five.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So you have some in the nest and some out, huh.
B:	That's right.
B:	How old are your children?
A:	We have,
A:	ours start at twelve
A:	and then they go down to four.
B:	I think the hardest thing for us has been, is to find you know, leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have, you know,
A:	I bet,
A:	yeah.
B:	like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the young kids don't understand it
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that,
B:	and.
A:	Yes,
A:	and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level, then the older kids get real bored,
A:	and they want to do something else.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can, I can relate to that.
A:	Um, do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one?
B:	I think it's improving, actually.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We had an interesting experience the other day.
B:	We, we have pretty much a, a routine that we spend,
B:	we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we just kind of keep them at home
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and our next door neighbor, uh,
B:	we were at a soccer game Saturday,
B:	and our next door neighbor was there,
B:	and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she said, no, Sunday's our family day
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them.
A:	That's good.
B:	And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.
A:	I think so,
A:	and I feel like, you know, like President Bush, Bush has mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation,
A:	and it does begin with the families at home
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so I, I'm a firm believer in that, too.
B:	I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.
B:	So.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's, that's true.
A:	Well, we see that a lot out here in Utah,
A:	and, um, hopefully, hopefully it's going to spread, huh. .
B:	Utah's a lot better than Texas.
A:	Oh.
A:	Um, do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas,
A:	or.
B:	Very few.
A:	Very few.
A:	You feel like you're in the minority?
B:	Oh, definitely.
B:	When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense.
A:	Oh, dear
B:	But, uh.
A:	Well, out here in Utah, five is about the the average,
B:	Average.
A:	yeah.
B:	My wife and I were in Utah until I guess we were about twenty-four.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Never been back, since then,
B:	but, We have kids up there now,
A:	Oh.
B:	so we get up occasionally.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, I have some relatives out there in Texas,
A:	in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on their ranch,
A:	and.
B:	Where, where in Dallas?
A:	Well, uh, no,
A:	I'm trying, Aberdeen?
B:	Huh.
A:	Is, is that close to Dallas?
B:	I don't have any idea.
B:	I've never heard of it.
A:	Oh.
B:	Must be a little town.
A:	Don't you.
A:	It's, I guess it's out there, clear out.
A:	They have a ranch that has like five hundred acres,
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	Martin, do you do any exercise?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
B:	Uh, I like to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.
B:	Those are probably the two main things I like to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, so those are more or less indoor sports.
A:	How's the weather out there in Georgia?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis.
B:	Um, I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring, fall,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but in the winter it gets pretty cold.
A:	Oh.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	so it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, how about yourself?
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I'm on a exercise program.
A:	I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, um half an hour every morning,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning,
A:	and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time.
A:	It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and, um, has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	I, first of all I'd like to get my weight off.
A:	I'm about fifty pounds overweight,
A:	and so I'd like to get the weight off,
A:	and then I'd really like to get into that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we have a, my husband and I have a, a, aerobic video that's called The Firm.
A:	I don't know if you've heard of it,
A:	but it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down,
A:	but you're using weights,
A:	and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done.
A:	It's it's really fun.
B:	Huh.
B:	Yes,
B:	it's, it's, it's it's similar to aerobics with weights
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but it's like low impact aerobics, just  with weights.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	Okay,
B:	are you familiar with, um, step or bench aerobics?
A:	Um, no,
A:	I mean, yes,
A:	I am,
A:	but I have never done it myself.
A:	Have you done that?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I have.
B:	In, in Atlanta that's, um,
B:	most of the health clubs are all,
A:	Oh.
B:	that's the, that's the in thing.
A:	That's the big thing, huh?
B:	At first it was just regular aerobics,
B:	but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over.
A:	Oh.
A:	So how is that?
B:	Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics,
B:	and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time.
A:	Oh.
B:	And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.
B:	But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know, that and movement of going up on the step you know, that could create a problem.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They, they seem to think that it, it won't,
B:	but you never know.
A:	Now, if, um, playing basketball, are you knees,
A:	do you have healthy knees?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point.
A:	Oh, dear
B:	But, I've, I've kind of taken care of that.
B:	I wear high tops and then also an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Well that sounds, you sound just like my husband.
A:	He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, oh, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I.
A:	So that's what he does,
A:	he wears his, his brace and his high tops
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did, I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, .
B:	I mean, it would only take three or four days
B:	and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way.
A:	Wow
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, dear.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, um, so how, how successful is your exercise video?
A:	It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I would, once I start my I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week,
A:	and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off,
A:	and the muscle builds real fast.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, you can start,
A:	they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month
A:	and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, uh, twenty-five pound dumbbells
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video
A:	and it's a hour long video,
A:	so.
B:	So it's a good workout.
A:	It is,
A:	yeah,
A:	I really enjoy that,
A:	so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of,
B:	it's quite cold and snow.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
A:	Now this one has been quite mild.
A:	Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.
A:	It was quite chilly
A:	but not,
B:	Hello.
A:	I pressed the button one,
A:	so we're recording right now.
A:	I'm sorry
B:	That's okay.
B:	I'm Bill from Raleigh.
A:	Okay,
A:	and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.
B:	Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Um, okay,
A:	Bill, we're talking about family reunions.
B:	Right.
A:	Okay, um,
A:	have you ever had to plan a family reunion?
B:	Uh, yes
B:	and no,
B:	it wasn't really a a planning one,
B:	but it was kind of, uh, it was a birthday
A:	Oh.
B:	and I brought a lot of family together then.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And how did you feel it went?
B:	It went pretty good.
B:	I'm, I've worked in hotels,
B:	so I, I kind of know how to do these things.
A:	Oh.
B:	I used to, you know.
A:	All this planning and, and getting together and such.
A:	Um, oh, let's see what else.
B:	Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,
B:	and and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She has like seven sisters I think.
A:	Oh, boy
B:	They show up and all their kids.
B:	And then all, she has, uh,
B:	I have like, uh,
B:	let's see,
B:	she has four sons and two daughters,
B:	and they show up and all their kids,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so it's a pretty big reunion,
B:	it's about two hundred people, maybe.
A:	Oh, my word.
A:	Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?
B:	Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks
B:	and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and then did you have a main meal,
A:	or did everyone just bring,
A:	it was just pot luck.
B:	It was kind of pot luck.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	show off a little bit
B:	Yeah.
B:	And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Now how old is she?
B:	Uh, she's eighty-six.
A:	Oh, goodness.
A:	Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.
B:	Now she does,
B:	she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	My nickname for her is Honey Woman.
B:	That's what I call her.
A:	Really.
A:	Well that sounds fun.
A:	Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,
A:	and there were,
A:	we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.
A:	And so that was a real challenge,
A:	and I was president of our family reunion for two years,
A:	and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,
A:	but I found that advance planning was the key to success.
B:	Uh, also one thing that's helpful,
B:	and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but most of, all my family lives like in the same county
B:	so
A:	Oh, that's wonderful, though
B:	But it's just kind of like get on the telephone
B:	and, it's so and such days from such and such date
A:	Oh.
B:	and everybody just shows up.
A:	Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.
A:	Yeah,
A:	our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,
A:	I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.
B:	I would say you're spread out, then.
A:	We are
B:	Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,
B:	because my dad was in the Army
B:	and we're we're pretty strung out all over.
A:	Oh.
B:	But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.
A:	In.
A:	Oh.
B:	I live in Raleigh,
B:	and then my, my parents live in Greenville,
B:	and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I mean, we're, we're spread out,
B:	but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro
A:	Boy.
B:	so.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Nobody moves away except us
A:	They must really like it there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I got out as soon as I graduated.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Just like this town is too small for me,
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Oh, you're ready to move on to
A:	How do you feel about gun control?
B:	Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed
A:	Um.
B:	but it's going to,
B:	a lot of the stuff that,
B:	I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that,
B:	well do you even know what the procedures are now?
B:	Um.
A:	There is no national,
B:	But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.
A:	Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,
A:	and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.
B:	Huh. I didn't know that.
B:	Well, that's pretty scary.
B:	So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.
B:	That's where I would probably be
A:	Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.
B:	Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better
A:	Uh-huh
B:	because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I can understand them wanting to have them,
B:	but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.
A:	Well, you know, uh, uh,
A:	if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know
A:	the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.
B:	It has?
B:	Because then,
A:	Well I mean yeah.
A:	The, uh, the
A:	in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.
B:	Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?
A:	Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.
A:	I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,
A:	but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.
B:	Yeah
B:	I know Dallas is.
A:	Uh. I mean, I think, you know, in the
A:	I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.
B:	I don't know if Dallas is in the top three
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but. Do you own a gun?
A:	No.
A:	I've thought about getting one.
A:	If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.
A:	I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.
A:	I would probably get like a shotgun.
A:	Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I do kind of live in the downtown area.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know and shotguns are really good because they're,
A:	I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.
B:	That's true.
A:	Uh, and you know, you,
A:	yeah,
A:	I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.
A:	They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,
A:	they are probably going to miss the person
A:	and, and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, you know.
A:	I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.
A:	You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You pretty much stop them.
A:	And, you don't,
A:	then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.
B:	and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I finally ended up giving it back to him.
B:	I said I don't want it.
B:	I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns
A:	because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,
A:	but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that, that person rushes you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And they get it from you.
A:	And you know, you're pretty much dead you know.  Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then, You know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Set them off.
A:	and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them
A:	and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.
B:	I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to you know, if I don't really know how to use it
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just didn't want the responsibility.
A:	Um.
B:	So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?
A:	Yeah,
A:	the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I would be scared selling guns to people.
A:	So, Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research?
B:	I think we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely.
A:	I'd agree, too,
A:	but, I mean, it seems like it just makes economic sense in that, you know, uh, you know,
A:	it would have made even better economic sense to, to, to have had a lot more research than a longer ago.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	for certain.
A:	You know, because, you know, because, uh, the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Does, does like, do health insurance policies, like, for companies and things, do they cover diseases like that?
A:	I think they cover AIDS,
A:	but what they do is, uh, if, you know, you apply for, for to get a, a insurance policy they'll, uh, check to see if you're H I V positive
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if you are, not only will they not give you, uh, a policy,
A:	but they'll, uh, they have like,
A:	there's like, you know, a database of people that have tested positive,
A:	so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again.
B:	Um, well, that's, but that's why they should have started doing stuff before.
B:	I mean, still, you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, you know, before the tests ever really came out who are, who are draining a lot of money right now. You know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, because of, of the, you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	That,
B:	Right,
B:	and all these God-fearing people were like, well, you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera, et cetera .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	uh, yeah,
A:	one, one, one one humorous retort I heard, heard someone, you know, who claimed that, you know, AIDS was, you know, God's punishment was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people.
B:	Uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Boy,
B:	that's a good one.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Yes?
A:	Uh, do you think, you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough right now to,
B:	No,
B:	I really don't.
B:	I did, I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff,
B:	and, uh, really we're not doing much at all,
B:	I mean, most of what gets raised, I mean, it's not really federal movement, most of what gets raised, gets raised by, uh, uh, you know, conscious, yeah, communities and things like that, you know.
A:	Private organizations.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, uh, San Francisco has a, a real, uh, strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff
B:	and and, uh, get, they get donations from the community, you know, they're real, And from corporations around the, around the city, you know, for AIDS research and that kind of thing
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, you know, rather than just in the places where it's, you know, where it's predominated so far, because it's, you know it's bound to spread
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, it seems that, you know, it's just, you know, of, it's just going to reach a steady, a steady state a let, a lot, lot higher point than it will if we, you know, we'd nip it in the bud to quote Barney Fife.
B:	Right
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I, I, I don't know what the likelihood of that is,
B:	but, I mean, you know, people really waking up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Especially with the ultra conservatives move our, our political system sort of seems to be taking.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would probably agree with that.
B:	Yeah
B:	so,
A:	Uh, so do, do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of, uh, people?
B:	God,
B:	that's a good question, Fish.
B:	I don't know,
B:	uh, I think, I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society, you know, kind of like lepers would you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's really, it's really not necessary, uh, until, until the, disease reaches its final stage, you know, becomes really infectious
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand, you know, try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not, you know, they don't, they don't have to be just completely cut off from, from the community
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that, and, uh, I don't know,
B:	I guess I think that, that, uh, research is, I guess the most important, just because I, you know, it, it really needs to come to an end. You know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I don't know, Fish.
B:	What do you think about that subject?
A:	I think it's, I think it stands a really interesting question of, uh,
A:	Well what do you feel about the, um, present situation in the Mideast?
B:	Well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you think, Mark?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	I think, I think there's definitely been some changes, um,
A:	and I think you know, the, the, um, end of the Soviet Union will definitely have its effect on, on the situation.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Um, you know, in that there's, there's not, you there, you know, you know,
A:	basically since the end of World War two there was always, you know, that little proxy war going on. You know, with, um, the U S funding Israel and, and the, um, Soviet Union funding the Arab countries.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then we'll see what happens when, uh, they're not funded quite as much.  Or supplied with arms the same way.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but on the same token, you know, Israel has lost a lot of their, you know, value to the U S in being, you know, the foothold of capitalism. You know in, in the Mideast.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I, we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, we kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was, you know, during the war,  uh, in, uh, Kuwait was, uh, the fact that they did not retaliate,  for the, uh, scud missiles that were, uh, launched there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That just seemed to me to be a, uh, a phenomenal, uh, demonstration of restraint,
B:	and it must have reflected, uh, uh, some awful good, uh, diplomacy on the part of the U S.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the, you know, they, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes.
B:	I see.
A:	They basically would have, you know, had a, had a they had, they would have had, had to fly through, you know, two enemies.
B:	Oh, you don't think they got the codes from the U S already?
A:	The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them.
B:	I see.
A:	I mean, of course, you know, public statements can be taken for,
B:	That's true.
B:	They can, yet they,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well what do
B:	what about this situation with the, you know, the, uh, continual, uh, harassment by Iraq right now and, uh, apparently failing to let the, uh, arms inspectors have free access.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, well, to begin with, you know,
A:	I pretty much question or what, what the U S motives were in, uh, in, in actually the original involvement.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I,
A:	the cynical side of me says that, you know, it was more for, uh, the, the domestic political situation than for anything else.  You know, and that, you know, and for portraying Bush is a strong President.
B:	Huh, yeah,
B:	okay.
B:	Sure.
A:	Uh, I mean I really, I really think that, that, my gut feeling is that, that, you know, he pretty much picked, picked the fight with, uh, with, um, Hussein.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean I'm not, not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight.
B:	Right.
A:	But, you know, I think, I think that, that, um, we chose to have our official feelings hurt.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Where a lot
B:	Well, do you think that, uh, we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and, uh, you know, move on into Kuwait and see what happens?
A:	I think, I mean I thought, I think that, um, in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, I really don't, I really don't think that,
A:	I think, I think it was, it was, there were, there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests.
B:	Right.
A:	Um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well may have been.
B:	You know, I'm not saying that that's not the case. Uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I mean in, in, in along this line since, since, you know it, it really, it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting, getting, uh, the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
B:	Right.
A:	I just don't, I just don't, I, I, I I, I, I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and, you know, in, in fighting a second battle.
B:	No.
A:	Um, you know, over, over the, uh, over, over what, what probably won't accomplish him, accomplish much for him politically.
B:	No,
B:	it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do, to do much more in there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even at this point.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well what about, uh,
B:	do you have any, any views on, uh, Israel's relation to the U S?
B:	Do you, think we ought to, you know, back off on our support of the country
B:	or what do
A:	Well, I have, I have very fixed feelings about Israel.
A:	Um, I think that, that for a long while we've, we've had almost a, you know,
B:	Uh, anyway, we're supposed to talk about recycling. Basically, what, what your personal opinion is on it.
B:	Uh, this is, this is really for a speech research project they're doing
B:	so, uh, I don't know.
B:	Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it?
A:	Well, they just kicked it off down here in, in Sarasota county.
B:	Oh, they did?
A:	Uh, they had been doing it,
A:	they started first in Sarasota City. Uh, you know, which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, they've got these, I don't know what, if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all.
B:	Not quite,
B:	no.
A:	They've got these,
A:	it's, it's county wide program now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage. Uh, yard trash. Plastic, cans and glass. And then, uh, paper.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	Which, in the paper, it's just, uh, newspaper and corrugated cardboard. Is the only thing you're supposed to put in there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	No slicks. Uh,
B:	Oh, that's, that's good.
B:	Let me ask you this.
B:	Do they require you to presort it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	See that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on.
B:	In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really, you know, tightly.
B:	But when I lived in Orlando, it's like you could put almost anything in there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they'd just sort it out for you
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah .
B:	It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	Well, you know, uh, I talked to this girl
A:	who, uh, she's a, an an acquaintance of mine
A:	and, and she's involved with, uh, oh,
A:	what is the name of that company.
A:	It's not Amway
A:	but it's the other big vitamin company? Shaklee.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	And, uh, and, and she's just Shaklee crazy, you know, because it's her business and everything.
A:	And, uh, you know, and she asked,
A:	we were talking one day
A:	and, and she asked me a couple of questions, you know.
A:	And she, and, and what she said that, that generally, the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one, they don't want it to change their lifestyle and, and like, you know, especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Which that's, that's what recycling at home sorting does, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean it's a little extra work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do, what  they do here in Sarasota county is they've got,
B:	It can,
B:	yeah.
A:	okay,
A:	you put your garbage in a garbage bag
A:	and you set it out by the curb.
B:	Right.
A:	If you have yard trash, you put your yard trash in some kind of container.
A:	Uh, or you can have bundles up to a certain weight, and certain dimensions, tie them up and  put them by the curb.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you got to tie them up and everything.
A:	Well, the plastic, cans and glass, they give you this little tub
A:	and it's about a foot and a half deep
A:	and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long.
B:	Right.
A:	This is a little container.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then they have another one the same size.
A:	That one's red.
A:	Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, so, like, you know, you would have to rinse out your pop cans.
A:	Otherwise you got bees and ants
A:	and you know, and, and if you've got, uh, food containers or anything like that, it's a big problem.
B:	Exactly.
B:	It is, you know, a big  hassle.
A:	So not only do you
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	I mean, up here, they give you one, one of those containers
B:	and you put everything in it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's like, if, if you use a lot of stuff, you,
B:	it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	This is true.
B:	So it's  kind of a pain in the butt.
A:	This is true.
B:	But, uh, I don't know.
B:	That's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just, you know.
B:	You have, have those garbage people that make, how every many, make twenty, thirty bucks an hour,
B:	have them do a little bit of the sorting. You know. And, and maybe come up with a better system.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Make it a little more convenient.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here. Uh, if you want to have a nice garbage can, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's on wheels
A:	and it's big.
B:	Oh, you can actually rent those?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah
B:	up here the, the city provides them.
B:	Kind of like,
A:	I think in, I think in the city they do
A:	but out here in the county you have to rent them.
B:	Oh, okay .
A:	And they just add it on to your water bill or something.
B:	So where exactly are you in terms of, of, like, Sarasota?
B:	Are you north of Sarasota or, East,
A:	East of Sarasota.
B:	okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And Sarasota is on the west coast?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	Like south of Tampa, right?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	I'm,
A:	Yeah.
A:	About an hour.  About an hour south of Tampa
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's,
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	well. I listen to this talk radio station down here
A:	and it's really,
A:	they,
A:	I don't if you ever listen to talk radio
A:	but those guys, they just kind of get into, to stewing up trouble, you know. With the callers and things like that.
B:	Um, occasionally.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they get into some really good conversations sometimes, you know.
A:	And some of it, sometimes it's serious
A:	and they have some good feedback and all that stuff
A:	and from listening to that, I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with
B:	Yeah.
A:	and this kind of fits into the, uh, the aid program,
A:	the welfare program that's going on right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's like, uh,
A:	So, uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?
B:	Ooh, well I don't know.
B:	What do you think?
A:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	I had a little bit more time to think about it.
A:	I was thinking of, like, uh,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I was started to think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those, you know, demographics studies that they do that, um, you know, have, who knows, how much, you know, stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and I don't know,
A:	I don't know how much the stuff actually, what they actually have in there
A:	but I know they use that, I mean they sell those,
B:	Huh.
B:	Well what about, uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was, that, that was the other one I was thinking of
A:	I think that's, uh,
A:	I mean I know drugs are illegal.
B:	It thing actually.
B:	Uh, I, uh, have worked at Texas Instruments.
A:	Huh. Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they instituted a drug policy there. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about it.
B:	I, I hadn't, you know,
B:	it really didn't relate to me.
B:	But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity
B:	and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,
B:	although they don't actually execute it themselves, it's really the government that .
B:	So, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well I, I think the, I think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their behavior
A:	and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able to evaluate them.
A:	I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a, you know, a chemical, you know,
B:	Well, what about this, uh, AIDS epidemic now?
B:	Where you find that, uh, uh, you know, certain people are actually are, are criminal in their disregard for  others.
A:	These people that are carriers and don't  that don't reveal it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and and, uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't,
B:	it, uh, it destroys their libido.
A:	Yeah, that would be kind of an extreme.
B:	Now, uh, you know if they ever,
A:	I mean I've heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of,
B:	So what about that as an invasion of privacy?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess it kind of borders on where, I mean what do you value more. The invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people.
B:	So really,
B:	it gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the general welfare of society.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess that's that's been the big role of government, I guess I mean generally.
B:	Well, it, it's supposed to have been.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into.
A:	I mean that, that particular case.
B:	No,
B:	it ,
A:	Because I mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, I mean they could require, you know, obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population,
A:	not a huge part but a, you know
B:	A growing part.
A:	the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do are spreading it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, again, to require, you know, such a test and and then to make, make it is to subject them to, to discriminatory practices and other things.
A:	I don't know,
A:	uh, I don't know how exactly I feel about that.
B:	Maybe chop their weenies off.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess, uh, uh, it's an easy one for me.
A:	I think that's, uh, there's something seriously wrong,
A:	yeah.
B:	What is it that you are, you know, particularly upset about?
A:	Uh, I guess, uh, I think they've lost their compass
A:	and, uh, I'm not sure they know exactly what, uh, uh, public education supposed to be for anymore.
A:	But, uh, I voted with my feet
A:	and, uh, my kids go to parochial school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh,
B:	What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in a, the public school system?
A:	Well, one hundred percent of the, uh, customers care.
A:	That's one thing.
A:	Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting.
A:	And, uh, they, uh, take an active, relatively active part.
A:	Which, uh, I mean if you're, uh, sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, uh, watch what goes on and you, uh, uh, pay attention and participate
A:	and, and you can influence the way things are.
B:	So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, uh, real estate or other taxes
B:	and, and, consequently, they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen?
A:	Yeah.
A:	The immediacy just isn't there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, uh, I also think that one of the problems
A:	and, actually, I don't think this, I think this is a cultural problem.
A:	The, uh, problem with public education is really, uh, really a problem with the culture.
A:	And, I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California, for example, where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school
A:	and you can't get a tax levy passed.
A:	Uh, people are, uh, reluctant to pass, uh, school tax levies even, uh, when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's, uh, they don't have kids in the schools.
B:	Right.
A:	I think that's a, a loss of civic virtue and a loss of, uh, uh, the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids.
A:	I think that's, uh, that's the principal problem is that, uh, people no longer see it as, uh, as their problem
A:	and there's an immediate problem.
B:	Right.
B:	It troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good
B:	and by definition, for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an educated populace and then  idea that, uh, you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in the, at the local level or bigger votes at the national level.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it means that you've got to be informed
B:	and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I, I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States, which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution.
A:	Uh, you know, it barely made it.
A:	I think it was added afterwards
A:	I think the real, the principal was, uh, education for civic participation.
B:	Right.
A:	The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter
A:	and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes.
B:	Right.
B:	It has taken on a more profound,
B:	and you'd think we'd notice it, economic uh, thrust.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's exactly what I was going to say.
A:	Now there seem to be really three reasons for education.
A:	One is education for civic duty.
A:	One is education for economic reasons.
A:	And one is education for civilization.
A:	I mean and I think that one,
B:	Well I'm glad that you added that one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that one's significant.
A:	That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor
A:	and then I quit and got disabused of that notion
A:	But, uh, the, uh, uh, now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is, uh, an economic enterprise to train people for jobs.
A:	And, uh, I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is.
A:	And I'm really sad to say this,
A:	I never thought I would have
A:	but I really think that, uh, the educational establishment has become part of the problem.
A:	And, uh, that's why I guess I'm sort of, reluctantly, uh, in favor of these, uh, choice programs.
B:	Right.
B:	Well I, I agree with everything that you've said so far
B:	and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact, I think, with public school teachers than perhaps you are, uh, except as a parent of your child
B:	and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing
B:	and they are the three things that you mentioned.
B:	But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related
A:	Right.
A:	That's what,
B:	like consumer,
B:	kids too?
A:	Yeah .
B:	Oh, you laugh.
B:	How many,
B:	what ages?
A:	Well, twenty-seven up.
B:	Uh.
A:	And we had five.
B:	You've been through the fun part
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And how about yourself?
B:	I have a four and a half and a three.
A:	Oh.
A:	well.
B:	So. It's,
B:	I, I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way it's done now and then.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, when mine were growing up, I did some traveling and but not that extensively
A:	but I always just made it a point, you know, to spend about ten minutes with each one of them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it was an hour, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.
B:	What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest?
A:	Six years.
B:	So they were all real close?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's tough.
B:	That's a lot of time.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	We look back and wonder how we did it.
B:	Did you both work? Your wife too?
A:	No,
A:	she never did.
B:	Uh, well, qualify that.
B:	She worked at home, I'm sure
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But that's, uh,
B:	well both my husband and I work
B:	and sometimes I feel like, you know, by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed, I have very little time each evening.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Maybe thirty minutes max.
A:	Well that's plenty though.
B:	And well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking
B:	and then I spend time with them while, you know, he's doing other stuff.
B:	And, and, of course, we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend.
B:	You know, there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it
B:	but it's neat,
B:	it's straight
B:	and I can live with it because  I do stuff with my kids, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house.
B:	Well, I've accepted that too
A:	And, you know  it, it's tough to find time. especially with both of them working.
B:	That's true.
B:	It is.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	And you just have to set the time and say, okay this is going to be it.
B:	Well, that's true
B:	and, and we do a lot of that on the weekends, you know.
B:	We try to spend Saturdays together.
A:	Right.
B:	If my husband golfs, you know, he'll do it during nap time, things like that where they're not really missing the presence, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	And, and we do a lot of family things together.
B:	We're, we're kind of going the other direction this weekend.
B:	We're planning a trip, just he and I.
B:	This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids  since she was born four and a half years ago.
A:	Well that's good too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good that way too
B:	Well, I decided that, you know, you need that once in awhile. That you, you need to plan the quality time
B:	and, and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes a day.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, you know, and as the kids got older I made them, you know, help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	and,
B:	And they think that's a family activity, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's great fun
A:	And, uh, well, yeah,
A:	if,
B:	My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the laundry?
B:	Of course, you can
A:	Yeah.
A:	Just keep them talking that way.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	Yeah
A:	But, uh, another thing we used to do is have family councils. Every Sunday night.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And what would you do,
B:	what?
A:	Discuss everything that didn't agree with them.
A:	And we'd take turns being president.
B:	Oh.
A:	And everyone would get one vote.
A:	And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it never worked that way.
B:	So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a  head that week
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well and we could bring up  and we could bring up stuff too.
B:	and then,
B:	Oh.
A:	And that was always good time.
A:	Boy, we really got to know the kids well.
B:	I imagine.
B:	And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	In  fact, they were all in, uh, over the weekend for Easter.
B:	I,
B:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	See I was raised in that type of family where, you know, you don't disobey me, you mind me
B:	but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it, you can always come back and talk to me about it.
A:	Well, we did too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I remember the one daughter saying, we had a, a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she said, hey I don't make fun fun of your friends
A:	so why make fun of mine?
B:	Uh well.
A:	Kind of kind of hit us between the eyes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	You don't think of it that way do you
A:	No.
A:	But that, that was always good quality time for us.
B:	Now that's good.
B:	I like  that idea.
A:	And then  never attend,
A:	but if, if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules.
B:	Whatever was voted on, huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	and boy, they, they'd show up.
B:	Well I think that's great.
A:	And we'd usually take notes
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us.
A:	And they loved it.
B:	I, I think that's true.
B:	I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, boy, I, I feel for you and your husband.
B:	Oh, why is that?
A:	Well, my, my, uh, two of my, uh,
A:	So how do you feel about it?
B:	Uh, I, I don't see any problem with, with testing for random drugs.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, myself, almost, uh, am in favor of it.
A:	Uh, I work at Honeywell
A:	and I went through a, a pretty, I don't know, I went through a, standard drug testing thing before I, I was brought on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's pretty standard.
A:	At least at Honeywell it is.
A:	Uh, I think it's important to insure the quality and, and, uh, I don't know, almost the goodness of character. You know  that kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where do you work?
B:	Uh, well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And I, I just came from Saint Paul. Uh, interviewing with Three M.
A:	Huh.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.
B:	If you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start.
A:	Right.
B:	And I guess the only drawback I can see to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, uh, sort of false positive result then there could  be some sort of problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that, that definitely happens, you know.
A:	I mean those, the drug tests, sure they're accurate
A:	but there's always that margin of error.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's, that's something to be aware of.
A:	Another thing is, a lot of times, you know, they aren't that accurate.
A:	They aren't that sensitive.
A:	Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going to do about that
B:	Yeah
A:	You know, I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell
A:	and, uh, uh, you know, I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something.
A:	Uh, I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types.
A:	Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this
A:	and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, I don't know.
A:	What, what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?
B:	Uh, electrical engineering.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Great.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida.
B:	Oh, wow .
A:	And this is actually a an internship up here.
A:	But, uh, they, uh, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing,
A:	so.
B:	They test you, uh, before they, before you start or before you even  interview
A:	Right.
B:	or,
A:	Uh, they essentially,
A:	no
A:	I sure don't to someone talking to uh,
A:	they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.
A:	So, uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests
A:	and, and then, they essentially give you the offer
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, there's some noise on this end.
A:	I'm actually in a mall calling
A:	so
B:	Oh
A:	You probably wondered, huh.
A:	But,
B:	Yeah.
B:	what happens if you were to fail?
B:	Then do they give you like one one more chance or two more chances?
A:	Yes.
A:	That's a good question.
A:	I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave, uh, if you fail I believe they give you one more chance.
A:	They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, you know, once again, those things are not that accurate
A:	so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail, you know.
A:	But, uh,
A:	are you working right now anywhere
A:	or,
B:	Uh, no.
A:	Okay.
B:	I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and, uh  just interviewing with companies right now.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Great.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening, you know. Was, was going to Honeywell.
A:	A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he's doing an internship with I B M.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, they, basically, uh, did the same exact thing.
A:	Uh, we both got our internships at the same time
A:	and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time.
A:	So, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Did, do they test you at, right now, at work too?
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	That's  one thing they don't do is, is drug testing while you're on the job.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, I think, I think the unwritten rule is, yeah, expect it
A:	but they don't do it.
B:	Oh
A:	You know, so. That's good I guess.
A:	I don't know.
A:	I mean, I, uh, I have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time
A:	and while I don't do any drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, uh, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up, you know.
A:	But no,
A:	they don't, they don't really do that.
A:	So.
B:	Wow.
B:	Is it formal policy that they said they might test?
A:	Yeah
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, first, um, I need to know, uh, how do you feel about, uh, about sending, uh, an elderly, uh, family member to a nursing home?
B:	Well, of course, it's, you know, it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do, you know. Unless it's just, you know, really, you know, and, uh, for their, uh, you know, for their own good.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'd be very very careful and, uh, you know, checking them out.
B:	Uh, our,
B:	had place my mother in a nursing home.
B:	She had a rather massive stroke about, uh, about uh, eight months ago I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we were, I was fortunate in that
B:	I was personally acquainted with the, uh, people who, uh, ran the nursing home in our little hometown.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I was very comfortable, you know, in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it.
B:	But there's,
B:	well, I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be, you know, could not take care of herself anymore, was confined to a nursing home for a while
B:	that was really not a very good experience.
B:	Uh, it had to be done in a hurry.
B:	I mean, we didn't have, you know, like six months to check all of these places out.
B:	And it was really not, not very good, uh, deal.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We were not really happy with, nursing home that we finally had.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Fortunately, she only had to stay in a few weeks
B:	and she was able to, to return to her apartment again.
B:	But it's really a big, uh, big, uh, decision as to, you know, when to do it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, is there something else we could have done, you know, in checking out all the places that, uh, might be available.
B:	Of course, you know, there's not one on every corner, especially, you know, smaller areas, smaller towns.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Probably the hardest thing in, in my family, uh, my grandmother, she had to be put in a nursing home
A:	and, um, she had used the walker for, for quite some time, probably about six to nine months.
A:	And, um, she had a fall
A:	and, uh, finally, uh, she had Parkinson's disease,
B:	Oh.
A:	and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.
B:	Right.
A:	Then she lived in an apartment
A:	and, uh, that was even harder actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because it was, you know, it was just a change of, change of location
A:	and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.
B:	Yes.
A:	I mean, she she had, she had children all across the United States
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, you know, she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, that was pretty heart-rending for her.
B:	I can imagine.
A:	I think when she finally came to the realization that, you know, no, I cannot, I cannot take care of myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's tough.
B:	That's tough.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, for somebody who is, you know, for most of their life has, has, uh, not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm, ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, you know, facing that situation, it's, it's quite a dilemma.
B:	Yes.
A:	I think,
B:	my mother, excuse me.
B:	Go ahead.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, my, uh, my, uh,
A:	probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that they, they had a great deal of, um,
A:	all the brothers and sisters got together
A:	and they actually had a conference.
B:	That's great.
A:	And, I mean, it was just, it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family, getting down together and doing that.
B:	That's right.
A:	And, and just the children were involved in the decision, because it involved just them. And, you know, making that decision and then finding a place
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and everybody had duties to perform.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, whether it was just, you know, giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot, of the decision making, you know, like finding a proper nursing home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep.
B:	You were very, fortunate.
A:	And they,
A:	I know.
A:	They, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it coming.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, so,
A:	I mean, it,
A:	I mean, I, I, I, I I, I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like, that for me.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	Unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities like that seem to fall to, you know, maybe one child in the whole family, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we, we,
B:	And, uh, it's usually not a very smooth, smooth thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We were, I was lucky too that I only have one brother.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, fortunately, we agreed, you know, on exactly, you know, what we thought should be done.
B:	My mother also was very very independent.
B:	She had her own, still had her own little house and still driving her own car, at age eighty-three.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We were lucky in, that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really, you know, really much aware of what was going on.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her choosing,
B:	of course, she would, she would not have been happy there at all.
A:	Um.
B:	But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, with my, with my grandmother I think it was, it was such that, uh, that she did not have the problem with,
A:	she was very well aware
A:	and her daughter came and visited her
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	at least her daughter, came and visited her and also her several grandchildren, came and visited her every day.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's great.
A:	And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest,
A:	um, I, I, I think it would be,
A:	it was more of a relief for her.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
A:	And, um,
A:	I mean, but she was truly, she was truly aware.
A:	I mean, I, I, I I don't know how I would, how I would deal if one of my parents came with, with Alzheimer's. or something like, that which is, which is far more devastating.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That would be tough.
B:	Yes.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	And, um, I, I, I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of care but the quality of, care.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	That the people that worked there were very were very interested that, to make it as close a home environment, as possible.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
B:	It would,
A:	I think, I think, I think, you know for myself I, I see that as probably the, the, what everything would hinge upon.
B:	Oh,
A:	Is it,
A:	how close is it to a home environment.
B:	Yes.
B:	That's right.
A:	That's the, that's probably the major question.
B:	I think that great strides are being made nowadays in, in caring for the elderly, you know, in several, in a, in a whole lot of areas.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Just people are, of course, populations getting older.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know it's, it's interesting that, that a lot, the population of the United States is changing because, you know, uh, now that so many more minorities, where they have had extended families for such a long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families.
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	It wasn't,
B:	true.
A:	But, I guess as we become more industrialized and more, you know, less in a rural situation we, we don't, we, we, we choose not to deal with the, extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome, when in reality it makes things much much easier.
B:	Yes, um.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
B:	Sure.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	And, people, things are scattered so much nowadays.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.
B:	Yes.
A:	You know I mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know, whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good, they're going to be a good caretaker for our children.
B:	Yes,
A:	But,
B:	just because they're grandparents.
A:	I mean they raised us after all.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I, I, I think that, you know, we always, uh, I mean, I've, I've had a lot of good experiences with, uh, with many many people especially where they've had, uh, extended family.
A:	And I, and I, I kind of see that, that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, uh, it's,
A:	money seems to be too big of an issue. With, with, with, with what's going on today
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	sure.
B:	realistically it is.
A:	and I, I think, I think that we may not, that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may, that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That would, certainly help.
A:	I mean, I mean we may not, we may not have as high a standard of living
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but the but actually have a truer standard of living.
B:	Right.
B:	That's just a matter of defining priorities, I guess or some priorities anyway.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think your right.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, I guess that was it
B:	Okay.
B:	It was good talking to you.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	All right.
B:	Take care.
A:	Hey.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, the first thing for me is I wonder, I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, um, if privacy is something that disturbs your private state, I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state,
A:	that's one thing,
A:	and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something out about you that's another.
A:	And the first kind of invasion of, the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in this country,
A:	but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that should be private, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.
B:	I, I think I agree with that.
B:	I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens, uh, when the phone rang
B:	and it's T I calling,
B:	my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message
B:	and then I realize, oh, no, this is something I solicited,
A:	That's right
B:	so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
B:	but after that I realized, no, I, I really wanted this
B:	and it was sort of exciting
B:	and so, that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	it turned out to be, uh, uh, an invitation.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Uh, and at the same time I think that I receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it.
A:	From, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh, commercial things.
B:	Commercial, solicitations primarily.
A:	Oh, that, that's a remarkable number.
A:	I get them rarely
A:	and I'm still astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever
A:	Um, because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what, they are.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.
A:	I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say,
A:	and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there.
B:	And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
B:	and you, one's feeling obligated, because of some sense of, of the way the ritual is played out.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, uh, that, that then ends up being the, the most common example for me.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, this one that you raised.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I don't think I would have thought about that.
B:	I think that's a good idea on your part.
B:	I don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of finding out information.
A:	Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,
A:	and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge.
A:	So there's, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,
A:	and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia
A:	It's a surmise
A:	and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.
B:	To, to surmise. It is there.
A:	I don't think I'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that.
B:	Well, I guess, although, I, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is, because, uh, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	Uh, if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it, well, then I guess one could assume one was invaded
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but I don't feel invaded by it.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	I don't, have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I'm not sure why.
B:	Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
B:	and if someone finds out something about me that is true, I, I don't have a sense of loss from that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then
B:	Um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	more harmed or something.
B:	right,
B:	because, you don't have anyway to turn it off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together?
A:	Yes,
A:	I did.
A:	I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it.
B:	That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a, that I would rather they didn't
B:	and that might be the sense of the spending pattern, for instance, that, that I would have thought to be private.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse
B:	so, or if my call rate of, of eight or so a week went up even higher because uh, someone had, had,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	They had you pegged
B:	Right.
B:	And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money
B:	and then all of, a sudden you get your thirty a week because now, they're advertising you.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.
A:	I mean, they said they would give it out to only select companies
A:	but, um, you know, just like software is only given out to customers,
A:	I mean, you can't believe that.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	It would, it would be pirated
A:	and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash price, for it.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has to do with it
A:	and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending habits are,
A:	and, you know, and, and that hacker just has to get in to, in touch with the sneak thief
A:	and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling, threatened as a result of, of it
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is.
A:	Yes.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I also thought about it, was of, uh, waiting to talk to you that, another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.
A:	But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy.
A:	If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I realize that that, I mean, I can take that for granted
A:	but I used to, I used to live in India
A:	and things are quite different there in terms of that.
A:	There's less of a sense of privacy.
A:	In fact, it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy,
A:	certainly the language I know doesn't, but just says a word for loneliness.
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.
B:	But, but no concept for wanting to be private.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, so there's not,
A:	I mean, doors don't have latches on them.
A:	People don't tend to knock,
A:	you just,
A:	if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way
A:	you, people walk in out
A:	and, as a, as a westerner in India, and I was often surprised, and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded.
B:	Oh.
B:	That, that would be, That would be culturally shocking
A:	You know, it very much is.
A:	But on the other hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and people would leave, me alone.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.
A:	Um, people start paying attention to you very much
A:	and they start asking questions and in the sense are invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.
A:	But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.
B:	Yes.
A:	And which isn't of, always the case in all cultures,
A:	and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.
B:	that is true.
B:	I haven't thought about that
B:	and, and that it's fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	And that's really, um,
A:	well, I mean, I, I wonder how people have sex, and things like that,
A:	I mean, they
A:	you go to India
A:	and it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.
A:	Um, but I, I just don't quite, um,
A:	there's hope, I actually for
A:	of the time I've spent there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy.
B:	Yes.
A:	Because anyone can be alone for some period of time
A:	but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect.
B:	Yes.
A:	And if that's gone, um, I, I really don't know how to live very well,
A:	and I wonder, I really do wonder how people do that.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	Are are there any other specific things that, that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?
A:	All the the other classic examples, the Jehovah's Witness or, or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away.
A:	And there's that sense of, I have now opened my door they now see what I look like, what I live like
A:	and and they're doing something that normally I really only invite, people to.
B:	Okay.
A:	Because I, any, anyone, any friend, anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me,
A:	but no one is just welcome to come by my house.
A:	So that is more of a sense of invasion.
B:	So, that's another example of the invasion because of the not so ...
A:	Hi Diana.
B:	Hi
A:	Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?
B:	Pardon me.
A:	Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all of you.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	we've, uh, been, um, we've gone other, you know, all kinds of places,
B:	we go out to dinner,
A:	Yeah.
B:	we take the kids to the park,
B:	and, uh, you know, whenever we, he, my husband has time off or something, we take them to the zoo,
B:	or we, you know, we do everything we can possibly as a family.
A:	Do you work outside the home?
B:	No,
B:	I don't.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't either,
A:	it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does,
B:	an, an then, uh, you know, my husband enjoys spending time with the kids, you know,
B:	he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So he, they can have time with him an.
A:	So you have a break too.
B:	Right,
B:	so and we, uh, we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home, you know, we have, we try to spend like Monday nights, we call it family home evening, and, have our kids, uh, you know, have little lessons with them, and, you know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, you know, teach them about their grandparents or something like that. Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, we just do all kinds of fun things like that
B:	an.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have family that's far away.
A:	It sounds like you might too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we do,
B:	so they, you know, the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Right,
A:	and phone calls that's about, about it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right
B:	and, uh, you know, they, we, you know, we go to the park
B:	or we go in the backyard and sit down
B:	an,
A:	That's yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Especially since my youngest one is excuse me, only fourteen months.
B:	Right.
A:	She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing, and likes to go places.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and with, you know, me being at home and just having the one income, you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, you know, extra things.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, you, you make more fun than, you know.
B:	You know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or, yeah, or, uh, you know, go get a bag of M and M's or something like that,
A:	Oh that's a big thrill for them.
B:	they, they think that's a lot of fun.
B:	So we just, we try to spend as much time as we can.
B:	We, you know
B:	our, our whole weekends are are devoted to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or something,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids
B:	and they come, go to church with us
B:	and so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so.
A:	Have, um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
B:	that's what.
A:	We we haven't lived here too long
A:	and we went there a couple of weeks ago
A:	and, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	the kids thought that was wonderful.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	we,
A:	I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two.
A:	We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.
B:	I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into,
B:	it was about a year or so ago, when we went.
A:	The one we went in had, uh,
A:	the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that, like a kid's place area.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	they had a lot of fun in there
B:	and, uh, there's, uh, there's some petting, you know, like, uh, uh,
B:	I think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting, you know, like a farm that you can go to
B:	and the kids can pet animals and stuff.
A:	Where's that.
B:	That's on Plano Road,
B:	uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,
B:	it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And that's a lot of fun.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	They have tours going through there
B:	and, uh, the kids think that was a lot of fun, too.
A:	Oh, that does sound like fun.
A:	It's a little bit of a ways,
B:	We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz
B:	or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonald's, you know,
B:	they don't go for the food
B:	they go for the, to play around
B:	and, There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business,
A:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's a indoor fun park
B:	and it has a bunch of different rides for kids.
A:	That's sounds fun too.
B:	And parents get in free
B:	and it's like, during the week,
B:	it's like five dollars admission per child, all day.
A:	And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,
B:	The petting farm,
B:	yeah.
A:	That sounds fun
A:	I think maybe we'll try to do that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	and the one in Mesquite is, uh, Scyene exit.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's, it's, uh,
B:	the kids just had a wonderful time there,
B:	they, you know, you just pay that admission,
B:	and then all the, the, the rides are free.
B:	You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that
B:	but, they thought that was lot of fun.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You can have birthday parties there
B:	an, I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do.
A:	Because they can just do,
A:	you don't have to have tokens for everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So they had a lot of fun.
A:	That does sound like fun.
A:	Well I've gotten some good ideas from you
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know, inexpensively as possible,
B:	so.
A:	Definitely.
A:	Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes
A:	but I'm sure that will be good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that will be good,
B:	yeah.
A:	It was good talking to you.
B:	Well it was good talking to you.
A:	I really appreciate your suggestions.
B:	Oh, no problem.
B:	Well, take care.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye,
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Well, um, with credit cards is, me, I, uh, I try to get maybe just one or two,
B:	I don't, I don't like having credit cards for every store.
B:	I, I, uh, I just don't like them
A:	What are you afraid of with them?
B:	What am I afraid of?
A:	Yes.
B:	Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.
B:	I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.
B:	I,
B:	uh, they are tempting at times,
B:	but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,
B:	so,
A:	Well, that's very, can be very, very true.
B:	So, and you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
B:	so,
A:	Well, that's the idea.
A:	They figure that, if they give you card, at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	That's right.
B:	See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,  so that you would be paying interest.
B:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month,  for the entire thing,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's what I do.
A:	right.
B:	That's what I do.
B:	Just a second. to child in
B:	Sorry
A:	That's all right.
A:	Sounds like you have a little one there.
B:	I have two little ones.
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, you have.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So
A:	Great.
A:	How old are they?
B:	um, four and two and half.
A:	Oh, boy. Those are two very active ages
B:	Yes.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	um, I'm, I'm like you
B:	I, I use my, only use my credit card for, um, you know, when I, you know,
B:	I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check,
B:	and then, but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines?
B:	No,
B:	I never do.
B:	My husband does at work just to get cash out,
B:	but, uh, I take the checkbook
B:	so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him
B:	and he gets it out
B:	and I don't even think I know my number
A:	Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks, in order to get cash.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
B:	See we, he couldn't do without it, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,  for nothing .
A:	Oh, that helps.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.
B:	You're right.
B:	And that's kind of silly.
A:	Yeah right.
A:	Absolutely.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because they, they figure that, that's correct
B:	You're defeating the purpose.
A:	The idea is to use their money
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, during that whole month and, then pay it at the end of the month.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week. People, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Because I,
A:	Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,  not be tempted.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's like,  I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. You know.
A:	Well,
B:	You've already been preapproved.
A:	oh, absolutely,
A:	preapproved.
A:	That's their favorite word.
B:	Yes.
B:	Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think.
A:	I think so, you're right.
B:	So,
A:	Well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much, you know, I'd spent this much money.
A:	That much stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.
A:	Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest, again
A:	That's right.
B:	so,
A:	That's right.
B:	Yeah
B:	so,
A:	Well it's been enjoyable talking with you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the same way,
B:	so, well,
A:	Right.
A:	Well take good care.
A:	Take care of your little ones.
B:	You, you too.
B:	Good luck.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Here goes Sharon.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars?
A:	That's the only thing I found out tonight
B:	Oh, you found that out tonight?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't even heard that,
B:	that's great.
B:	I think he deserves every penny of it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.
A:	Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Wonder because football,
B:	And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.
A:	And a lot more games, right?
B:	And I was walking,
B:	and it got kind of dark.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I was by myself,
B:	and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.
A:	Ooh.
B:	And, so I, I kind of got frightened,
B:	and I kind of use that as an excuse.
B:	All I have to do, is start earlier,
B:	but.
A:	Right.
B:	I haven't walked since,
B:	so.
A:	It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.
A:	I know what you mean.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it sure is.
B:	It sure is.
B:	How about you?
B:	Do you exercise on a regular basis?
A:	Um, well, I try to.
A:	Um, I started at the beginning of this year,
A:	I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again,
A:	I'm going to be real good,
A:	and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, uh, aerobics classes there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they run for two months at a time.
A:	And you have to, you do have to pay to take them.
A:	And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half,
A:	so that was four and a half hours a week.
B:	Oh.
A:	And it cost sixty dollars,
A:	and I thought, okay, that's not cheap,
A:	that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.
B:	Right.
A:	And I had a friend of mine going,
A:	so I was real good,
A:	I only missed it about three times.
A:	And then, oh, March came around,
A:	and I signed up again,
A:	and I got, uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I,
A:	and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there.
A:	And so that was two weeks I had missed,
A:	and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's once you get out of that habit you just don't, you don't get back into it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because I teach school,
B:	and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.
B:	We went in together and hired a private instructor,
B:	and she came to our school twice a week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, I, I was,
B:	I would go faithfully,
B:	and then I missed once.
B:	Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think, if you,
B:	you just have to stick with it.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April,
A:	and this session is about to run out.
A:	Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes
A:	and some of them require me to go out of town,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and, uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone
A:	and I've found excuses, uh things like I had the flu last week,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I'm fine this week.
A:	I could have gone Monday.
A:	I could have gone tonight,
A:	and I didn't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I'm kind of finding excuses,
A:	and now it's kind of like, well,
A:	this is the last week.
A:	I'll just start fresh next week.
A:	But, I better better do it.
A:	And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.
A:	She started taking tennis lessons,
A:	and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah
B:	that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like it's misery loves company.
B:	I don't really love exercise.
B:	I mean, some I,
B:	the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,
B:	and, uh, it's not President's any more.
B:	I don't know what the name of it is anymore.
B:	But she loves it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She just enjoys it so much.
B:	And I don't.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm the same way.
B:	I feel good after I do it,
B:	but I hate it when I'm doing it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I just,
B:	I don't enjoy it at all,
B:	and she just loves it.
B:	So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, it's a daily thing for her.
B:	So, it, you know,
B:	and it's so hard for me.
B:	I envy her,
B:	I wish I could be that way,
B:	but I don't. I don't,
A:	I do too.
B:	and I have an older sister that loves running, too,
B:	and she runs all the time,
B:	but at, to me, it's every minute's agony,
B:	and I,
B:	in fact, I don't run.
B:	I hate to run.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something
B:	and that helps, you know, pass the time.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	walking is kind of boring.
A:	I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,
A:	and we try to, we used to try to get together,
A:	and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.
A:	There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And it's not as boring if you get several people
B:	That's right.
A:	and you can kind of talk,
A:	and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,
A:	and the aerobics isn't too boring.
A:	I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. Um,
A:	it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, I do, I do have to make myself go,
A:	and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,
A:	and after I get finished I feel great.
B:	Oh, it's great afterwards,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean, I can go in there,
A:	I can be,
A:	like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,
A:	and I'll have headache and everything,
A:	and I get out,
A:	I don't have a headache any more.
A:	I feel great,
A:	and I'm just,
A:	it's amazing how much better I feel.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then just in general, I sleep a lot better
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	and I just feel much better.
A:	I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,
A:	and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better.
B:	Exactly
B:	it does,
B:	it gives you energy.
A:	But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm too tired,
A:	or I have a headache
A:	or,
A:	well, I just got over the flu,
A:	and I'm still kind of draggy
A:	so I better not go
B:	It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it really is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,
B:	and, you know, it's silly not to,
B:	but, I don't know,
B:	it's just a put off.
B:	I don't know why I don't do more,
B:	and I, and I know that it's good for my health.
B:	I know, you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.
A:	Right.
B:	So, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.
B:	So.
A:	Right.
B:	There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,
B:	but I don't know.
A:	It's just hard to make yourself go.
A:	And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,
A:	and I've been sweaty,
A:	and, and it, you know,
A:	I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.
A:	So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night.
B:	Right.
A:	But, um, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Does it cost the same for just two nights or,
A:	No,
A:	it's less expensive.
B:	Well, that's good, too.
A:	This one was only forty-five dollars.
A:	But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	So hopefully.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's right there,
A:	and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.
A:	They've got two different aerobics rooms,
A:	they have the mirrors.
A:	Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall
A:	you don't like to see how you work.
A:	But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.
A:	But,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then they hire private instructors?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And they have ceiling fans in the rooms,
A:	and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. Um,
A:	and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.
A:	I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can see that would be, uh, easy.
B:	They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.
A:	Oh, yeah
B:	Well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?
A:	Quite a few do.
A:	They have probably, ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,
A:	and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. Uh,
A:	they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter,
A:	and I guess guys can take advantage of that.
A:	For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But there's a lot more guys that do that one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,
A:	they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that.
A:	So they have big variety.
A:	They even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.
A:	I've never done that one before.
A:	But.
B:	Oh, you have a pool there, too?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, how nice.
A:	They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.
A:	They've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need just about.
B:	Wow.
A:	It's a real, it is a real nice facility.
A:	It's also got a full inside basketball court,
A:	and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things.
A:	But it's, it is very nice.
B:	That's great.
A:	I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should.
B:	Now to use,
A:	I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.
A:	But.
B:	Well, does it cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to to go swimming.
B:	Do you have to pay for that, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,
A:	and it's about eight dollars a month.
B:	Oh, that's not bad.
A:	No,
A:	not at all
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Pretty cheap.
B:	Um.
A:	And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,
A:	but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.
B:	I think so too,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?
A:	Hm?
B:	People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	in fact, uh, the T I-er's families can come in on these things,
A:	I'll let you go first.
B:	Oh, well, what's there to say?
B:	Doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion.
B:	Seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know what you mean.
A:	Um, I,
A:	in Maryland they, they do have capital punishment,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I've seen, uh, a lot of people get convicted, sentenced,
A:	and then just nothing happens,  just endless, endless, endless appeals.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well from what I
B:	I saw a statistic just a few days ago, um, so far this year, or was it during the last year, during a year's time, I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation.
B:	Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row.
B:	So I, I,
B:	and it's building up, you know,
B:	they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them
B:	so it's really building up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons, uh,
A:	just,
B:	Yeah,
B:	everybody's got that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I mean, in,
A:	here it's, uh, to the point where they were letting prisoners go. Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser crimes,  in order to put more people in, into the jails.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it was just, uh, amazing to me,
A:	and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,  and being rearrested an.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Isn't, isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was.
A:	Uh, I can't remember.
A:	Refresh my memory.
B:	It was, uh, that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. In the in the presidential race.
B:	Uh, may, it may not have been Maryland.
B:	It may have been Massachusetts,
B:	I don't remember.
A:	Um, I don't remember myself.
B:	Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime
B:	or do you think it can if it's done right?
A:	Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference.
A:	Right now,  I don't see it making a difference.
B:	If it,
A:	I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death.
A:	I mean,  most people out there committing murders don't care.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	They just don't care.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care,
B:	it's not because the punishment,
B:	but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The police don't catch them,
B:	or the courts don't convict them,
B:	or, or they don't serve very much of the time
B:	and so, uh, you know, their, their success rate is very high.
B:	Crime does pay,
B:	you can make a good living at it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that, uh, have
A:	and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust,
A:	and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring
A:	and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year.
A:	I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.
B:	Last year it was D C,
B:	I guess Baltimore caught them.
A:	Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up
A:	and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, uh, once you kill off a few of them
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the only consolation is so many of the murders are, you know,
B:	the, the violent people going against each other
B:	and so they, you know,
B:	society's not going to put them to death,
B:	well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. Uh,
B:	I think, I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, you know, this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society
B:	and we are there by going to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I, I personally think life imprisonment,
B:	I don't think much of of life imprisonment. First of all, it's never, turns out to be life,
B:	but second, you know, why should we,
B:	the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole.
B:	Well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again,
B:	well then, why bother.
B:	Just execute them, because that's, that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty
B:	So,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, it makes sense, um, you know,
A:	you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused, but I mean, uh, so few and far between, uh, you know,
A:	makes good T V movies
A:	and that's about it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and also, um, the, the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false
B:	but rather it's on the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and that way we can be sure, you know,
B:	we can find out the truth,
B:	we can find out what really happened and, and base the sentence on what the person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
A:	Yeah,
A:	I had,
A:	my, uh, my father-in-law participated in a, uh, a jury trial,
A:	he was, he was actually on the jury,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, uh, this man was accused of killing, uh, I think it was two people, uh, and shooting a, uh, policeman, um, point blank in the face.
A:	Of course he didn't die.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, this was during a holdup of a, uh, uh, a restaurant
A:	and it came out during the trial that, um, they had tried to rob another place
A:	and, uh, when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a couple cookies, and, uh, you know, jumbo cookies
A:	and, and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.
B:	Just started shooting people,  because they botched the first job
A:	You know it's,
B:	and,  so now they're going to get even.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and get even with who,
A:	I mean,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know, stupid guys
A:	And, uh, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And of course, you know, they tried to make the cop look like he was, uh, a, uh, no good rotten drunk.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean it was amazing.
B:	So what was the verdict,
B:	what was the results there.
A:	Oh, he was found guilty,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	He, uh, um,
A:	last I heard, he, uh, he beat a push for the death penalty.
A:	Now whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I kind of, uh, stopped listening after a while.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, you know, he would come home
A:	and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on
A:	and of course then they had to go back to you know,
A:	after he had to go,
B:	The, the penalty phase,
B:	yeah,
B:	they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.
A:	Right.
A:	And, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's, you know, that's the way they wanted to do it.
A:	And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, uh,
A:	you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges
A:	but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, you know, you just have to decide, you know,
B:	well there's really two separate decisions there I guess,
B:	one is, did it really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know,
B:	is this man really guilty,
B:	and you have to decide that,
B:	but then you have to decide, you know, as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that
B:	I, I've never been on a jury,
B:	I've never had that experience,
B:	I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	But I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, I mean besides murder,
A:	I think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,  caught more than twice or something, uh,  it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence.
B:	I mean,
B:	I can handle people, people selling drugs, you know,
B:	it's, it's wrong,
B:	but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for.
B:	But we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life.
B:	That, you know,
B:	you, never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I agree.
B:	And so I go,
B:	these are the kind of people I would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say I don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree,
A:	I, I've, I have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person.
A:	And, uh, as far as, uh, you know
A:	there are some, some other crimes that I think, uh, you know, uh,
A:	kidnapping, um, you know, when they,
A:	I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal.
A:	I,
A:	some of the cases I've heard about over the years,
A:	I pay a good deal of taxes I guess, because I, I make a fair amount of money,
A:	and, uh, the taxes that I pay, um, I guess as a, as a general statement, I feel I, I guess I get my money's worth for.
B:	Okay.
A:	I'm not sure, though, whether I feel,
A:	I guess I am sure that I feel that, in general, though, uh, the allocation, uh, of the taxes in certain areas, isn't correct.
B:	Well, I'm sure that, uh, probably every person in this country would agree with you on that.  Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go.
A:	Well, I, I,
A:	lately, I guess, um, uh, or, at least for the last twenty years or so, I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, uh, defense items, at least in the last ten years, have been, uh,
A:	there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there,
A:	and I'm not really sure that, that we've gotten our money's worth there, uh, regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm, uh,  Desert Shield, uh, situations.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the, over the years of being called back and things of that nature, is, uh, I've found that, you know, there's an extraordinary amount of waste.
A:	I take that as a, as a given in any military operation
A:	and
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	no argument here.
A:	yeah,
A:	and I
A:	I, I should imagine that, that, that what the, what the problem,
A:	why I, I'm, I'm a little concerned about today is that this, uh, rather, uh, quick and, and easy, I don't know, I shouldn't say easy, rather quick victory in the, in, in the, uh, Mideast, uh, uh, over the, uh, Iraqis, uh, might lead us into, uh, a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe.
A:	I'm, I, I don't know what other foe that would be,
A:	but, uh, I, I'm just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, of course, uh, a lot of, uh, a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war,
B:	and the, and the inventory's going to have to be restocked, uh,
B:	on,
B:	now I work for T I,
B:	and one of the things we were told is, like, they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for,
B:	and they used up two thousand of them in, in the war,
B:	so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that, to get ready in case something else is needed.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, it, it, it,
A:	would that be, uh,
A:	well, let's see,
A:	two thousand out of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent. Uh,
A:	I, I should imagine that, that would be to keep it at a level, those levels, I guess, that, that were originally appropriated was when the Soviet threat, I guess, was perceived as being a greater one.
A:	I don't think there's very much of a threat there today.
A:	I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories, uh, in their territory over there, and who's controlling them,
A:	but
B:	that's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	I, I don't know what amount of, what amount of, our hardware would stop some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, uh, that would be irrational.
B:	Well, of course now, we used up twenty per cents, per cent of that inventory,  in a matter of just a few weeks,
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, uh, uh, T I also makes the missile, which was the, the T V laser guided bombs
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, a big percentage of that was expended, as well,
B:	that that that was just a matter of,
A:	Oh, what is the name of that?
B:	Uh, it's called Paveway.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	And, uh, a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.
B:	So those are two areas in which T I stands to, to gain some, some short term business to restock that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, uh, I'm,
A:	what I'm,
A:	uh, I guess uh, it,
A:	concerned about,
A:	talking about the taxes in general, and that, that was an area that I, I perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for, uh, in the area of defense,
A:	or perhaps we have paid too much there,
A:	I don't know,
A:	it just seems to me that over the years, now, the,
A:	and, and it's, it's a cliche,
A:	I, I,
A:	but I see it myself,
A:	I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways.
B:	Oh, no doubt.
A:	I, I, I don't know, uh,
A:	I I'm familiar with some, some upbeat school areas,
A:	so I don't totally agree with the, the great, uh, uh, with the, with the great expenditure of effort and time there,
A:	but I guess overall, because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, and, and, uh, and, uh, rural school systems are like, I, I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	as a matter of fact, in Texas, um, we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the, a state judge,
B:	and they,
B:	and, uh, the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill, which,
B:	basically, what it does, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts, that are, that are, you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state, that are not so affluent.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They, they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system,
B:	Uh, well,
A:	or is it all funded out of local taxes?
B:	okay,
B:	to to give you some perspective, this, this town that I had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by state funds.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey, we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this,
B:	but, they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it,
B:	and they dumped it all on the local school districts.
B:	So,
A:	Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, so what ended up happening was, was a, was a shift.
B:	We went to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years. And, uh, I mean,
B:	Oh, complete, complete.
B:	It's all shifted to local districts,
B:	and now, even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being, is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state.
B:	That's right,
B:	and, and I have, I have no problem, with, uh, a certain, uh, floor level, minimum level, that's a standard uh, that everybody, uh, ought to be able to have, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, I am opposed to, any attempts to restrict, um, local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum.
A:	Yes,
A:	I see what you're saying.
A:	Uh, I, uh, I, I do, I, I guess I am a uh, a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education.
A:	I mean, by that I mean, I'm a product myself,
A:	I have, uh, a, a, a, a background of, uh, being, uh, getting my college education through the G I Bill.
B:	So did I.
B:	My Masters, anyway.
A:	What,
A:	but, uh, when I look at it to me, uh, it doesn't really make any difference.
A:	It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done,
A:	I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial uh, easement made possible.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's right.
A:	And I, I don't really care what it takes to qualify, whether you're, uh, an, an whether you're a veteran or whether you,
A:	I don't even know if you have to perform community service,
A:	or unless, uh, or, or you promise to even do something in the future, I think that, uh, the, that, that, the subsidy itself,
A:	or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation,  would give many people who, I, I think, I think I perceive the fact,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	at least what I read, is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their, uh, out of their, uh, budget.
A:	I know in the state of Florida just today, uh, the, the legislature, uh, adjourned,
A:	and, uh, they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the, in the, uh, state land grant colleges, which, which isn't, I mean,
A:	to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money,
A:	but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They went from eleven to fifteen hundred,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five per cent.
A:	I don't know what that would be.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they had to, they had to raise, uh, community college taxes here, a few years ago.
A:	But that, uh, I guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to, uh, was expending so much money on defense, uh, that, that the program now is a, uh, program now is, uh,
A:	fees that, that fund these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states
A:	and, the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they, they must charge fees. Uh,
A:	I, I'm not too sure of that reasoning.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I guess to get back to the main topic, I don't know whether I pay too much taxes.
A:	I, I, I travel extensively in Europe and see enormous, uh,
A:	people pay, uh, a great deal in taxes,
A:	they tell me when I sit and talk to people
A:	there they tell me they, they,
A:	some states they pay, uh,
A:	in Germany or in, in England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes.
B:	Oh, oh, I can believe that.
A:	But, but, I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in, my car tax, my income tax, and these myriad of, uh,
A:	now it costs me money to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which is getting to, uh, quite high levels,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that.
B:	Well, I guarantee you, you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if, uh, the Democrats had more say.
A:	You really think so?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I really do.
A:	But I mean, what's, what's happened here is, is, is
A:	I feel that, that in the last ten years, uh, my taxes have gone up,
A:	they haven't gone down.
A:	I pay uh,  quite a bit more taxes
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and, and,
B:	Everybody, everybody is.
A:	but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years.
B:	Well, what, what, what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase To keep it, to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious.
A:	Well I,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, this has been really interesting,
B:	and I've enjoyed our talk.
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	I guess I just push something here.
A:	Push one again, right?
B:	No,
B:	you just, uh, we just say, say good-bye
B:	and that's it.
A:	Just hang up.
A:	Okay,
A:	Don, good talking with you.
B:	Nice talking with you, too.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Um, I think life, uh,
A:	now I grew up on a farm,
A:	I don't,
A:	what kind
A:	did you grow up in the farm.
B:	I grew up in, um,
B:	well, at that time I was in a, uh, Trenton , New Jersey
B:	so, and it was a suburb of Trenton ,
B:	so I really had mixture of suburb,  and urban living.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think though it was much slower and, uh, much more self-contained.
B:	I think you're right.
B:	It's interesting
B:	I'm, um, I work in a high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, I'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing.
A:	Yes.
B:	And the pressures on the children, uh, you know,
B:	you hear this as an excuse,
B:	but it's true they are so much greater.
A:	Unreal, unreal by comparison.
B:	Oh, I cannot believe, uh, what they're doing, uh, academically the demands on them
B:	and, uh, and I can see why children do drop out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's right.
B:	I can see, I can see the, uh, you know,
A:	I, I can remember as a child, you know, nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	It wasn't, it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
A:	they were,
B:	And you, you didn't, you didn't have to lock your door.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	And, uh, a
B:	some of these are urban worries
B:	but, uh, it's, uh, it's a lot different all though I guess twenty years a go now, in this area, things were, um, similar because twenty years ago
B:	let's see,
B:	it was after,
A:	It's not all that long ago is it
B:	yeah, to
B:	twenty, twenty-five years ago is when we had the Washington riots,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	the first rights we've been having some problem now
B:	and it reminded me of that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we were living in New Jersey. Uh, in, twenty years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Whereabouts?
A:	In Allendale .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on,  at sometimes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I don't know though
A:	it's, it's kind of hard to really know because of
A:	though the news media had those riots, uh, kind of blown up out of proportion.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well,
A:	because I went there many times
A:	and,
B:	the Washington riots weren't,
B:	because
B:	The Washington riots weren't
B:	because I lived right downtown,  Washington
B:	and, uh, and what you saw is was what you got
B:	I'm telling you.
A:	That's what,
A:	yeah,
A:	well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, you know, it's, it is interesting, uh,
B:	they're so many
B:	they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures, uh,
B:	the pressures of drug is so much,
B:	the prevalence is so much greater,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the, the kinds of diseases that you've got out the, uh, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean the consequences is
B:	so much of what's going on,  is so much more serious then when we were younger.
A:	I think that's true,
A:	I think that's true.
A:	I think the other thing is that, uh, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our, in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when, when I'm number one, you know, and, uh, uh, uh, worrying about self and not, uh, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and, uh, support for young people that the kind of support that they need,  to help them take care of the things,
B:	Yes,
B:	and,
A:	if you don't have some kind of, of basic believe or something down inside of you,  then it's very difficult to, uh, have anything to turn to,  when you got, when you've got something facing you like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
B:	I also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents, um, children who will lie and cheat
B:	and you approach their parents,
B:	and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, you know, they're constantly,  excusing their,   child
A:	Like .
A:	Right.
B:	and you can see exactly,  why the child is that way.
A:	Yeah
A:	exactly.
B:	You can as a teacher, can't hold a child accountable,  if you're not going to get reinforced by,  that at home.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
A:	that's right.
B:	And you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day,  what's not been done for,  fifteen or sixteen years at home,
A:	No.
A:	That's right.
A:	Oh.
B:	and you're, you get mixed signals
B:	so it's, it's not always the school's systems
B:	I think a lot of,
A:	No,
A:	there's so much more, then that
A:	it starts, very much deeper then that
B:	yeah.
A:	I think that too.
A:	I see some flickers of, of, uh, of good directions turning,
B:	No .
A:	but whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know,
A:	it's just,
B:	Of course, life is a lot more complicated too in ways, um,
B:	the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained,  for now.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, you know, with farming being so mechanized,  uh, people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	factory jobs are so much more, um, uh, sophisticated.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right.
B:	And the kinds of knowledge that, uh, you know,
B:	it, it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
B:	and,  some people just don't have it.
A:	Right.
A:	And there's so much, so, so many people on the lower end of those who, who are going to be the, the drop outs and the,  and the poor and the homeless and whatnot,
B:	And you worry when,  you know these the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's just another,
B:	uh, in terms of what it's going to mean to a society,  in the future it's a
A:	Yeah.
B:	some ways it's rather frightening,
A:	It really is
A:	it's just, it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think,  of, of the jobs that is out there to be done,  in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be,
B:	It certainly is.
B:	Well, it sure is.
B:	It sure is.
A:	Uh, not that I really think that they were perfect ten, twenty, or thirty years ago,
A:	but,
B:	It was a little easier though wasn't it?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	just the volume makes a big difference,
B:	Yes.
A:	I think as, uh, as, uh, mother you know, I use to think sometimes it's not so much, uh, it's not so much the kids,
A:	it's just the volume of it,  to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and, you know, and everything.
A:	Right.
B:	uh, I look at my mother's life
B:	I mean she, she didn't work, um, um,
B:	for a long time when I was very young she didn't drive.
B:	Uh, she learned to drive I think when I was, um, a teenager,
B:	and her life was a lot simpler,
A:	Right and,  and children's lives were simpler because mother was there,
B:	and I sit here,
A:	somebody was there.
B:	That's right.
A:	And, and when there's nobody there,
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	I always thought too that, you know, people worrying about going to work when their child, when their children are little
A:	and I, and I think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much,
A:	but I, I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go,  to go work was when they were teenagers.
B:	They need you more as a teenager .
B:	Isn't that true.
B:	That's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home.
B:	Um,
A:	Right,
A:	it's not so much that they come to you every minute,
A:	but it's that you are there when they need you.
B:	That's
B:	isn't that,
B:	that's so true,
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, uh, I find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it keeps me from being the old fogy
B:	so, but at the same time,  it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes,
A:	Yes,
A:	I think that's true.
B:	as to what's
B:	but that's the same
B:	I'm home in the summers,
B:	I'm home with the holidays,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
B:	I'm home at three o clock when the children are at home
B:	or where home,
A:	Yeah.
B:	one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college,
A:	Well,
B:	and, uh,
A:	But that helps a lot,
B:	It's, uh, it, uh, it does,
A:	I have a daughter who just had a second job,
A:	she needed to work
A:	and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her. And, uh, and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	and, uh, and so I,
A:	, you know, good kind of experience as well
A:	but, uh,
B:	Well I,
A:	I think that's really important
A:	I don't think people realize how important it is.
B:	That's, that is, that is so true,
A:	Yeah, uh,
B:	and it's not that always that the children always say something
B:	but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you realize it's important that, uh,
B:	and yet, you know, we have to make that choice
B:	I think twenty, thirty years ago a lot of women,  just didn't have to make that choice.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's right.
A:	What was, what was your name again?
B:	Well, I,
B:	Linda Lee.
A:	Linda.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	And your name was?
A:	Well I think probably that we've just about
B:	Well I enjoyed,  talking with you.
A:	I'm going to,  change the world
A:	but, uh,
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking with you.
A:	Yes,
A:	it's nice talking to you, too.
B:	Okay.
A:	Bye now.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	There we are.
A:	very Yes .
A:	Tell me, what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up?
B:	Oh, well, uh, when they were little, we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks, and things of that sort,
B:	and, I had two boys.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They were both interested in things like model rockets,
B:	so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
A:	I have two boys also
A:	Uh, my children are, um, are swimmers,
A:	and so as they were growing up much of, uh, our, um, normal life outside of school and everything uh, revolved around their swimming.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, in order to have a reason for being there, especially as they got older, I became involved in it too
A:	so we were always together at their meets.
B:	Oh, well, that's good.
B:	Um, mine were not terribly sporting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, they both did T-ball and soccer in grade school,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but neither one of them carried on, uh, the sports after that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the, the boys tried those,
A:	but they they did go in,
A:	they started swimming when they were, oh, seven and eight,
A:	and they really loved it,
A:	and they're swimming both
A:	they'll be,
A:	one is in college, also swims in college,
A:	and the other will continue to swim in college,
A:	and they're fortunate,
A:	they even made nationals.
B:	Oh, wonderful!
B:	Oh that's great!
A:	And so we would drive up to see that when whenever it was reasonably close,
A:	but, we did a lot of things, um,
A:	and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children, um.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I,
A:	we live near Washington,
A:	so we, we would always go in for the museums.
B:	Sure.
A:	That's always a big, uh, thing.
A:	And one of my children is, uh, also a musician
A:	so, um, one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go, either my husband or I, or both of us would, concerts with him.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my other child, um, uh, is in, big into tropical fish,
B:	Uh.
A:	so our whole family, we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows,
A:	so
B:	My goodness, uh.
B:	Well, we didn't have any, uh, avid, uh, activities like that,
B:	they, they were interested in a lot of things,
B:	but nothing to quite that depth, I guess.
B:	But, we would,
A:	I don't think we've, we've missed a fish store on the entire east, northeast coast of the United States
B:	Oh my goodness.
B:	Well, we did go to things like aquariums and, uh, uh, natural history museums and zoos, and all of those things that one does with kids, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
A:	In fact, it's funny,
A:	our vacations have always been, um, uh, uh, as, as they've gotten older.
A:	When they were younger we would go to the beach,
A:	but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things, and that there would be a, a feature each day. Whether it would be going to,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, yes.
A:	one summer we, uh, we went up to New England
A:	and we went to the marble quarries up there, and, uh, to see that, and another day fish hatchery,
B:	Oh, really .
A:	and, so we did, you know, we did try,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and of course we learned too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, and, uh, I don't know,
A:	I, uh,
A:	when they were very young I did not work.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I started working half-time when, uh, they were at the nursery school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I
B:	yet.
A:	And I, I started working part-time when they were in, um, junior high school and high school,
A:	and now, and I worked in the school system,
A:	and now I work a full school day,
A:	but that leaves me off on holidays and summers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it was a, it was a, you know,
A:	I think they need me more, when they were older, than they did when they were,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, I think, it, uh, they need you in different ways.
A:	That's true,
A:	yeah.
B:	You want to be around for the crisis and things like that,
B:	and, but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making
A:	That's right.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	that's, that's for sure.
A:	That's for sure,
A:	what do you, do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see?
B:	Well, it
B:	the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I don't think it needs to be the mothers,
B:	but I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.
A:	Yeah,
A:	when they , you know
A:	it was funny,
A:	I can remember,
A:	and my mother and I have talked about it, to how important it was when I came home from school.
B:	Um.
A:	It wasn't really conversation,
A:	but there were always things that just tumbled out.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, uh, granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it,
A:	but it,
A:	when they, when it's not there they miss it.
B:	I think that's true,
B:	but I I also think that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even when I was there, my boys didn't share all that much with me, and certainly not to the extent I did with my mother.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	No,
A:	I, I, I realize that,
A:	but it's funny,
A:	they don't always do it,
A:	but occasionally they do,
A:	and you want,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and when they do, there's a reason for it, that they're sharing it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you want to be at least I've wanted to be available, when they, for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me. Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about,
B:	Right.
A:	and it was, uh,
A:	you just felt, gee, if I weren't here, how,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	or, or if my husband,
B:	Who would they ask?
A:	That's right.
B:	Or what would they do?
A:	Yes,
A:	that's exactly right.
A:	Uh, but it has been, um, it's been interesting and particularly I, I think because the society in which we live, families are separated.
A:	You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I mean, I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I did too.
B:	We were close to my, uh, maternal grandparents, I mean, just a few miles, and, uh, close enough to visit my paternal grandparents, you know, quite often.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	They were fifty miles away
B:	but,
A:	See, and we're,
A:	uh, that,
A:	we, I, I grew up with, you know
A:	every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and it was sort of an Italian family,
B:	Um.
A:	um, but my children,
A:	we, although we have some relatives in the area that we, we see, we,
A:	they don't
A:	it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, when my kids were quite small, uh, we lived close to both sets of grandparents
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they saw them a lot,
B:	but they don't have any cousins, uh,
B:	or they didn't,
A:	Yeah.
B:	their, uh, their cousins are about ten years younger.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, they never played together or anything.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And there are only two of them
B:	and they didn't live in the same town.
A:	that
A:	the trend of, of families and time,
A:	where, where parents are spending less time, you don't have the families, too, to take up the gap.
B:	That's right.
A:	And so the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, uh, the model, the role models that get the, the, the family issues that get discussed, and all these, I think are very important parts of them growing up,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so we, we try to, to do it as well as we can.
A:	We keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and cousins and aunts and uncles,
A:	and we do,
A:	but it's, although it's not the same, we are,
A:	and that's part of, I think, teaching too, is what a family is like,
A:	because then how do they pattern their own?
B:	Well everyone makes its own model,
B:	but, uh, it seems that there should be some continuity,
A:	Yeah, Um.
B:	and it's helpful to have, uh, things that become family traditions, and that sort of thing.
A:	That's,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, we've always, we have had this tradition, um, that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had.
A:	Now, this year, it's, was hard with our son now being in college.
B:	Yeah
A:	So this was one thing that we, um, weren't able to do this year,
A:	but we did that for from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until, uh, our older son went away to college.
B:	Oh, well, that's the kind of thing that they will remember, though.
A:	And we have advent calendars still, from the time that they came, you know, to,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ours finally disintegrated.
A:	Oh.
B:	We had a felt one that was
B:	it was a Christmas tree that had, uh, a little trinket for each day, that was pinned on the date,
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	That's,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and then you took it off and put it on the tree,
B:	so at the end you had a decorated tree.
A:	Well, ours is, uh,
A:	a friend  uh, a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child.
B:	And it finally got moth-eaten,
B:	we threw it way last year
B:	How nice.
A:	And, I mean, they look today as new as they did when they gave them to, she gave them to us,
A:	and there's a ring
A:	and you buy a present,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	and you wrap the present up,
A:	and I mean, the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things,
B:	How cute.
A:	to today, where, um, sometimes I put a little gift if I see something that's, uh, occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their, their future, to sometimes, just money, uh, pieces of candy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I think as they're getting in college, I just,
A:	for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day. Which was the equivalent
B:	Oh, I'm sure he appreciated that!
A:	well, it was the equivalent of a Christmas present.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it was, uh, and it was, and, you know, it was fun,
A:	but that's a tradition
A:	and they will, those will be passed on to them when they, when they get married and leave.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you were saying what other trends are there,
B:	and one just occurred to me because I was editing a book about it recently,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that is the trend in a lot of, uh, lower class areas, for the grandmothers to be raising the children.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
B:	And that's,
B:	a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs.
A:	The
A:	yes,
A:	and the broken families.
A:	We, um, as I said, living in an area of Washington, D C. We definitely see this, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it's that grandmother figure, not only raising her own children, but raising, um, children from the streets, too, frequently.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, we had a sociologist at the center where I work who was writing a book on, uh, multigeneration, um, matriarchies, in a way. uh, where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Yes,
A:	well, this is a, this is a
A:	uh, this is in fact, uh,
A:	we've been studying this in our school, that, um, this is one of the symptoms, or not the symptoms,
A:	it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing,
A:	it's a rite of passage
B:	Yeah.
A:	well, Myrna, how do you get your news, news?
B:	Uh, most of it is from the radio, uh, and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We usually watch the local news and the, the, uh, national news both.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm pretty much the same.
A:	I, uh, I find that, uh,
A:	I'm a graduate student
A:	and I, I read a lot for school
A:	and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I just, I'm reading so much all the time.
A:	And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.
B:	Well you can always get up and leave that
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh, I I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper.
B:	Either
B:	by the time I get home from work, it's already, you know, time for the news to come on.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, it's so much easier to sit there
B:	and besides, I can be doing other things and still listen to the news.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right,
A:	I, I agree.
A:	That's,
A:	a lot of times I eat while I'm uh, watching the news.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the same thing.
A:	Is there any, uh,
A:	what did you think about the coverage like over in the, uh, Persian Gulf?
B:	I think they did a great job.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I thought so too,
A:	it was, it, you know,
A:	for a while when we were really interested, uh, we saw it all the time.
A:	Some of the stations I guess carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there
A:	and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah.
B:	And you could always find some channel that had something on
B:	but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	yeah,
A:	just news,
A:	that's right,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I noticed that one thing that, that T I did, you know, they had, uh, uh, they used to have, well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they used to have a program called T News, and just updates of, of different things that were going on within T I.
B:	Well when all the, the mess with, uh, uh, in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well now, they have had so much good response from this, that T I now has C N N on all the time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh, well that's great.
B:	So, we can always run upstairs and, you know, get a quickie update on what's going on, if we really want to.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	or if you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's really good.
A:	That's, um, I've found that when I, I don't have cable television anymore, uh, when I moved, went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to buy, rent a cable T V line, or whatever, you know.
A:	So I don't get C N N, uh, which was a big disappointment.
A:	I used to watch,
A:	that was my,
A:	if I wasn't home,
A:	I'm a college teacher
A:	and sometimes I teach in the evening
A:	so I'll miss the evening news.
A:	And uh, you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N.
A:	I think that's, that really has changed the way, uh, I look at the news.
B:	Yes
B:	Yeah,
B:	we don't get it either,
B:	we live out in the country,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we just don't have it available out there where we are.
B:	But when we did have it, uh, we, that's what we usually watched, was C N N
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, uh, same,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	when I had it, I, I watched it, you know, religiously for half an hour
A:	and then you could go on, you know, to do what else you wanted to do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	I find I, I read very little,
A:	I don't even get a regular newspaper and, uh, because, uh, I, I don't drive that much,
A:	I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work,
A:	I, uh, I find I spend so little time in the in the car that I don't really listen to the radio, you know,
A:	I don't,
A:	so. So television is my main new source.
B:	Oh, I get that too, because I, I'm in a van pool,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm in the van, you know, uh, two hours a day
B:	an.
A:	Oh really,
A:	to commute to work?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Oh.
B:	And in the, in the morning I try to sleep because it's, it's dark thirty.
B:	But in, but in the afternoon, uh, I try to read
B:	so I can, can, uh, not pay attention to what our driver is doing
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can,
A:	the van pools I know that,
A:	and I'm in the Baltimore, Washington area,
A:	and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas,
A:	but if you want a nicer home, you know, beyond the suburbs, you know,
A:	I,
A:	that's necessary.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Are, are you in Baltimore itself?
A:	I am, I am right outside Baltimore.
A:	I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line.
B:	Um.
A:	And I go to a a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house.
A:	So I, I'm actually in Baltimore,
A:	yeah,
A:	you could say I'm in Baltimore.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have two kids over there.
A:	Oh really,
A:	in Baltimore?
B:	well no,
B:	in, in D C area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	one works for the State Department
B:	and, uh, uh, the other one is, uh, uh, her husband is in the Navy
B:	and he's stationed at Bethesda
B:	an.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	oh that's, that's, that's a really nice area, Bethesda area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	it's, um, it's funny,
A:	there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington, even though they're so close.
A:	There's only an hour, less than that between the two
A:	but there is a big difference in things like property values
A:	and, um, the closer you get to D C the more expensive it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, the, the, uh, different slant.
A:	Washington, it really is a, uh, uh, an international city, where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore.
A:	You know, it, there's really, uh,
A:	most people have relocated to the Washington area, you know.
B:	Oh no,
B:	I'd, I'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	I, I like it, I like it a little bit better, too.
A:	It's interesting though, um, to meet different populations.
A:	I, I'm just now being, uh, from Pittsburgh originally,
A:	I'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things
A:	and I find that really interesting, you know, to imagine,
A:	here is somebody that was in China, two years ago when all that was going on in, in, uh, Beijing.
A:	You know, that, that's an interesting, uh, interesting perspective.
A:	But I, I really
A:	much, much like the hometown area,
A:	yeah.
A:	And I think that also goes,
A:	it's funny,
A:	you, you can watch different news.
A:	I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news
A:	and I really do watch Baltimore news.
A:	You know, that really makes,
A:	I don't really bother with the Washington station because I just, it's so far removed from what I'm interested in.
B:	Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is, is the crime problems that they're having there.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah
A:	they, in fact they just, it was just a big thing recently
A:	they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics,
A:	um, they had to impose a curfew that, uh, in two of the areas in, uh, in the Washington suburbs.
A:	The mayor,
A:	they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then, uh, brought in,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I heard about that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then came a woman that's um,
A:	she's big in the Democratic party
A:	so that's good,
A:	so she has good national ties,
A:	but she also was, um, something like a, uh, state auditor or something like that before this position.
A:	She was a state auditor,
A:	I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia, at Washington.
A:	And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party
A:	and now she ran for mayor,
A:	so she's uh, fiscally she's pretty tight, and, uh, she's cleaning house
A:	an, and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job, uh, for Washington, you know, which is,
A:	you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there.
A:	You know, from what I pick up on the news, uh, it's a difficult process, you know, to get rid of a, a bad mayor.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the, the downtown areas,
A:	Right.
B:	they both moved way out.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	I think one of them lives in Germantown
B:	and I can't remember where the other one lives.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but those are Germantown is a nice area.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's a nice area
B:	It's, means they have to drive a little bit,
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well they might be car pooling too.
A:	Do they car pool in?
A:	Are they driven by themselves.
B:	Uh, well now, I, I think he carpools,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back,
B:	but, uh, now my daughter they have probably been carpooling together, in fact,
B:	because she had been called back up, active duty.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday.
B:	So, I haven't talked to them this weekend,
B:	I don't know what the situation is,
B:	but she was,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They didn't call you for Mother's Day?
B:	We were gone
A:	You weren't home?
B:	Uh,
B:	no,
B:	we weren't home
B:	but she had, she had called and left a message on our recorder
B:	but I had that from all my kids except for one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, that's good.
B:	So.
A:	Well I guess we should stop now.
B:	Well I thank you for calling,
B:	I have enjoyed it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	oh good.
B:	I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the United States,
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh, uh, so do I,
A:	I've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever,
A:	I, I really enjoyed it.
A:	It's, it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective.
A:	It's interesting to see the, the wider world,
A:	so I enjoy it.
A:	Hey, thanks a lot, and, and bye.
B:	Thank you,
B:	bye, bye.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well, I do not know.
A:	How big a city is Rome?
A:	I mean, you have heard about Dallas,
A:	and the crime here is pretty bad
B:	Well, Rome is pretty small
B:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I was going to say.
B:	we hear a lot about, uh, New York City.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	There is a lot of crime down there.
B:	And I am, I am afraid to go down there because, you know, I mean, you hear about people getting mugged.
B:	You leave your car for ten minutes
B:	and it is stripped when you come back.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you ever been there?
B:	No,
B:	I have not.
B:	Only to the airport.
A:	That is, uh, probably enough to see
A:	Um, are you in college right now?
B:	No.
B:	I am, I work at, for the Air Force.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, there is a base up here.
B:	And,
A:	Are base,
A:	that's interesting concept.
A:	Are bases safe, you know?
B:	Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in.
B:	And,
A:	Yeah.
A:	The, they, uh, minimize the access.
B:	Right.
B:	But even so we had a, uh, uh,
B:	at New Years, we had some people come in and, uh, like attack one of the planes. Because they were protesting, uh, the presence over in the Persian Gulf.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, no.
A:	Sure.
A:	Oh, great.
A:	That is wonderful.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, Dallas, uh,
A:	we lived in Minneapolis. Uh,
A:	we moved here about ten months ago.
A:	And Dallas is pretty, uh,
A:	well, we live in north north Dallas which is like a suburb, near a suburb called Plano.
A:	So we are out of the city,
A:	but it is, uh, it is bad everywhere in terms of, uh, you know, the handgun situation, um, the number of rapes, the number of muggings.
A:	Just, it is, it is,
A:	I would not say it is not as bad as New York,
A:	but it is pretty scary.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know. They call them ornamental grates.
A:	But they are still bars
B:	That makes it bad for getting out during a fire.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It really does.
A:	And if you are a little bit claustrophobic
A:	but, uh. I do not know,
A:	I mean the jails are crowded.
A:	I, I, I am not a criminal justice specialist,
A:	so I do not know what, you know, what can be done.
A:	I am, you know,
B:	I do not, I do not know,
B:	it seems to,
B:	I think it is getting worse. Because I keep hearing things
B:	like I, when I was I went home,
B:	my parents live in Boston.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I went home,
B:	and we were watching T V,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and this thing came on where these, a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and, and robbing them.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it was really disgusting.
B:	And my mom was like, "They should just be all shot right now."
B:	And I mean, you
A:	Were they teenagers
A:	or?
B:	Uh,
A:	Like that girl in New York that got beat up by, you know,
A:	when she was jogging in Central Park, a couple of years ago?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Um,
B:	They were not, I think they were early twenties.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They were young men.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But they, so they weren't, you know.
A:	And were they, uh, were they, were they obviously poor or you know?
A:	That is really
A:	Like I say,
B:	I know it.
B:	How deprived could they be if they had a camcorder?
B:	Those are a thousand bucks.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Unless they stole it.
A:	And I mean, that is one big thing down here.
A:	I mean, they have like, uh,
A:	and they are not all young.
A:	I mean, they are eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women.
A:	But, I mean, you can, you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television.
A:	And they are,
A:	sometimes it is the same people that have been, that have been observed
A:	and they still can't catch them
B:	Yeah.
A:	And you are wondering how, you know. Um, we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.
A:	I mean, there was all kind of,
A:	I, I, know, I, I, I know it is getting worse.
A:	I do not know what the world is or is not. Uh,
A:	the
A:	in a small town in Wisconsin, near Madison, um, a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun. And killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the child had,
A:	and he, they said that he was twelve years old,
A:	and he had, uh, he had not, uh, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And you are thinking to yourself, um.
B:	I wonder where,
A:	I know.
B:	I do not know.
B:	I wonder where he gets it?
B:	You know, you must,
B:	I think T V is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on,
A:	That
A:	and I do not think a lot of parents,
A:	I mean, I do not, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base.
A:	But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know.
A:	I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They do not, they do not talk to their kids and take them out.
B:	And, and are not there all the time
A:	Uh,
B:	so the kids are off to their own devices a lot.
A:	Right.
A:	And discipline.
A:	I do not know how your folks were,
A:	but I mean I sure knew as heck when I was growing up that, uh, my parents were the superior
A:	and I was the subordinate.
A:	And, you know. It was sort of like there were boundaries.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	And I do not think, I do not know, I think today a lot of parents, um, are ruled by their kids.
A:	I, I,
B:	I think so definitely.
B:	When you go to a restaurant, and like kids are running all over the place. They,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	I mean, they are not learning how to, uh, well, like boundaries.
A:	I mean, I do not, I see it in work place too, sometimes.
A:	I do not know how old you are,
A:	but you sound a little bit younger than me.
A:	But, I am in my thirties,
A:	and I, uh, I see, uh, even people that work with me that are ten years younger.
A:	That, you know, they kind of have an attitude that I I hate to to say it,
A:	but it's, that's just what it is.
A:	It is an attitude like the world owes them something.
B:	Yep.
B:	But, they,
B:	Right,
B:	I, I see that too in the Air Force.
A:	Do you?
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	A lot of, uh,
B:	especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work.
A:	Are you in the Air Force?
B:	I am in the Air Force.
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
B:	And so, uh, people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do.
A:	Sure.
B:	And so all the young engineers are like, well, I am just, going, you know,
A:	Huh.
B:	get it for all it is worth.
B:	And that, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	and I am like, you are the one who signed up.
B:	If you did not want to do it.
B:	And,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	And the Air Force is one of the bitter, better military, supposedly military experiences.
B:	Yep,
B:	it is.
A:	I mean,
B:	I like it a lot
A:	Pardon me?
B:	I like it so far.
A:	I mean, that is,
A:	are you going to be a career person?
A:	I'm digressing,
A:	but, I do not talk to many people in the military.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I am,
B:	Probably not.
B:	But, uh, they pay for my college.
B:	So,
A:	That is the way to do it.
A:	I mean, and that's,
A:	you know, at least the Air Force is,
A:	I do not know, I just, uh, I am nervous in Dallas.
A:	I mean, I, you know, I mean, I go to like an aerobics class or something.
A:	And, I, you know, uh, seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building.
A:	And you are supposed to feel safe,
A:	but then there are all these,
A:	it does not matter race,
A:	but, you know, it is an inter racial mix.
A:	And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I do not even think that way,
A:	but I mean, you just think to yourself, you, you just, I mean,
A:	nobody can think that, that it can't happen to them.
B:	It,
A:	No matter who they are
A:	or where they are at, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And you never know who is watching, either.
A:	I mean, did you,
A:	I do not know, I was in the grocery store this morning.
A:	We, uh, went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night, driving.
A:	And it is about seven hours.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Um, and that is a very,
A:	we had never been there.
A:	That is a very, very neat town to visit. Uh, in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things you hear about.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But the crime is so bad there.
A:	I mean, in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do.
A:	How to carry your wallet, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	This is New Orleans?
A:	New Orleans,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh, I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras.
B:	Let me tell,
A:	I would never,
A:	yeah.
A:	You just do not.
A:	Do not even bother.
A:	It is not worth it.
A:	Uh, the, when we came back, I do not know if you have seen.
A:	I was in the super market this morning
A:	and on the cover of TIME magazine, there is a girl, she is in Boston?
A:	She is on the east coast somewhere.
A:	Real attractive young girl.
A:	College freshman, I, college coed.
A:	I think she is a freshman.
A:	She had been dating a fellow for several weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They went back to her dorm room
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and date rape.
A:	I mean, and it just,
A:	she looked anguished.
A:	I mean, it was really just sad.
A:	I mean, did not pick it up and read it,
A:	but I should have.
A:	But I just looked at the picture and thought, what a world.
B:	I know
A:	I mean, I do not,
A:	yeah,
B:	You can't trust anybody.
A:	I do not have any, uh, cure,
B:	It is, it is really scary.
A:	No,
A:	you really can't.
A:	I mean, I, they, we lease out a really nice two story town home in north Dallas.
A:	And they have a real big thing here.
A:	People, I mean, even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, you know.
A:	They, everybody wants your business kind of thing.
B:	Right.
A:	And my husband is the kind of guy, he's, he's sometime,
A:	he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.
A:	And I think sometimes it is just, he and I are very different in terms of that.
A:	I, I mean, I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts.
B:	Right.
B:	We,
A:	And, uh, he opened the door.
A:	I came downstairs
A:	and I was real upset
A:	and I probably got more nasty than I should have.
A:	But I just said, Howard,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know,
A:	oh, my God.
A:	I would not, I mean,
B:	Well, you, you, hear about people opening the door and getting blown away.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And it does, I mean, it is, it is not a reason.
A:	I mean, I have been to New York.
A:	You should not deny yourself going to visit and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but it is not any worse.
A:	I used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by, uh,
A:	are you from Boston?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know I never felt,
A:	I mean, I have been to downtown New York City
A:	and I have been to downtown Boston.
A:	And I never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston, staying at the Meridian,
A:	I did not pay for.
A:	But, I mean, I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city I have been in, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	So I would say one thing.
A:	Do not deny yourself the New York experience, but go with people that you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I would not want to go by myself.
A:	No, uh.
A:	But I mean, it, yeah, I do not know.
A:	I mean, I, I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals. Uh,
A:	I think the handgun,
A:	I am not real big on guns myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	I think our justice system needs to be stricter. I mean, because everyone, they do it
A:	I mean,
A:	Are the New York, uh, are the New York,
A:	I do not know how the New York state prison system is
A:	but, Are they booked up?
B:	Yeah.
A:	That is a way to put it,
A:	they are booked up.
A:	Are they paroling, uh, like murderers
A:	and, I mean, here it is just a real big deal.
A:	They parole people that have killed police officers
A:	and then they are out doing it again.
B:	Right, um,
B:	I do not, I do not know. Because I am not real up on a lot of news things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, you know, you just hear about that, that, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it is a lot of repeat crime.
B:	And you are like, why are they repeating?
B:	They should have been in there longer.
B:	Or,
A:	I know.
A:	And then you think, I mean, I I mean, I can remember, I have not been out of school that long,
A:	but it has been at least ten years.
A:	And you think to yourself, was it that bad back then?
A:	Or is it just,
A:	I think that, like you said, television?
A:	Is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it, you know?
A:	I mean, people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.
B:	It seems like a lot of,
B:	that it is more, like in Boston,
B:	there was a case of, uh, a couple of kids, fifteen year olds.
B:	They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they, they picked on this kid who was like new in town.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they were like, well, no one was going to miss him anyway, you know,
B:	and it like,
A:	Oh, god.
B:	ugh, that is horrible.
B:	How can you even think like that?
A:	it is, yeah, isn't it something?
A:	I mean, I, I have a, I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
A:	and I have a niece and nephew.
A:	And I just, uh, I mean
A:	my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going, Michael, how did you hear about that?
A:	You know, it is just, I think kids get too much too fast. And all those sort of things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, uh, they had that thing, you know, the high top sneakers, the Air Jordans, et cetera.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Kids killing each other and beating their brains out.
B:	Oh, for the sneakers.
A:	Right.
A:	Or the, or the jackets, the team like the Raiders and the caps.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, stealing the hundred dollar jackets.
A:	Uh, I mean, it is I guess, it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they, in Boston.
A:	That is crime where they videoed.
A:	That is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Where they videotape themselves.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like, you know, be ...
A:	Um, what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas,
B:	Well, the, the, the major cause it seems up here is
B:	I live right on the ocean
B:	so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the major cause here, and we always seem to, and it seems to be validated by the press, is the car pollution.
B:	We don't have too much industrial pollution.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that, that I can really put my finger on here.
A:	Um, that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major, um, industry except for, uh, government and services.
A:	And the, the transportation situation is such that, uh, all the car pollution is, is absolutely awful.
A:	Um, also the worth of the hub of three airports
A:	in this general area there is, uh, National, Dulles, and then, uh, Baltimore, Washington.
A:	And it,
A:	interestingly some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from, uh, uh, airplanes is extraordinary.
B:	Is that so?
A:	Yeah,
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	and that's always something that, you know, you just don't real, you don't think about.
B:	Well, most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution.
A:	But the, uh,
A:	apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I would think so.
B:	You know, uh, I guess it talked about all types of pollution.
B:	I happen to just read something the other day at least in the Boston paper there were three things that, that come to note.
B:	One, is that the carbon fluorides that are, uh, being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer
B:	and again
B:	and now they've located another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere.
B:	So
B:	so I'm quite concerned.
B:	I don't think it's involved any longer with, with, uh, hair sprays or those
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	I think it's now, is what, uh, from what I understand it's air conditioning units
B:	and, and, we certainly turned into an air conditioned society.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned,
B:	and I do quite a bit of business in Washington.
B:	And,
A:	I mean you know what it's like here.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it's quite,
B:	is, is the
B:	it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned.
B:	And,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and I guess refrigerators,  are the same way.
A:	We just had the,
B:	They release that.
A:	That's right.
A:	So, solutions to this, would be
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I,
B:	Well,
A:	you know, improved.
A:	Well, I guess the the, to me the first thing is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get, getting people upset about animal rights.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean this is so, so basic.
A:	It's human rights in the sense,
A:	but, uh, in terms of demanding, it's just not caused
A:	but demanding that, uh, we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward, um, improvement of polluting vehicles, and not just cars but also buses, um, planes. That something can be done. I I can't imagine that well ,
B:	Well, I, I
A:	if we can't send people to the moon, that we can't improve these things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	I think that it can be done simply because, uh, uh, we've, we've,
B:	every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter.
A:	Converter,
A:	yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And no lead gas was, came to the pumps.
B:	And, and that's been done.
B:	There's the lead pollution has, that problem, essentially I guess because it was at crisis proportions was, was licked.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that there are there are solutions,
A:	And that for buses,
B:	certainly we don't even need a, need a research anymore.
B:	It's just a matter of passing the law,
B:	and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry, the automobile lobby is.
A:	That's right.
A:	Well, and also to make it economically feasible. Uh, and also in buses.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	I don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus,
B:	Oh, yeah, well,
A:	That, you know,
B:	That, that, the, the smell is awful
B:	and but, you know, I was reading the other day not to go on with this but that, diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So, I guess you're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although I can never, I could never, uh, really rationalize that while I was sitting there
A:	Yeah,
A:	but even, of course, in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I'm, I'm thinking of research in that direction rather than
A:	we, we've taken the intermediate step
A:	but I don't think, fossil fuels are the answer.
B:	Well, we, you know
B:	up here in New England, uh, where I've,
B:	right close to where I live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is, practically a, you know, guerilla war up here, went on for years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes
A:	I
B:	Uh, my daughters marched in the, uh, uh, against the Seabrook
B:	and I kind of, uh,
B:	my feelings were that we needed this bridge to, to, uh, to jump from whatever it was going to be, from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you don't throw the baby out with the bath water, and condemning nuclear use.
B:	Yeah.
B:	unfortunately though I think the oil companies have lied to us for years
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	So we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left
B:	or there isn't,
B:	and, uh, and, uh,
A:	But with the pollution issue, uh, fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway.
B:	No.
A:	Uh, so you've, to you've got to look elsewhere.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, but it is something that's a little frightening
A:	and in fact, well, I,
A:	within our family we have said,
A:	my husband,
A:	I have two sons, uh, well,
A:	one is already in college in New England,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the other will be going in September,
A:	and we just feel that when we leave, uh, this area, we're going north, not south.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, I like the mentality north,
A:	and I also like the fresher air up there.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, I mean that's the way we will be going.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, so, I, I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they, their attitudes are.
B:	Well, since, since Texas and Louisiana and, uh, California that, in that ranking order, the worst pollutants in America.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I read that the other day.
B:	I mean Louisiana for a small state it was amazing
B:	but it's the industrial pollution I should imagine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I, I,
B:	And how old are your girls?
A:	They're eleven and eight
A:	and I gave in at Christmas
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and they have, they keep their cages real clean.
A:	It always smells of cedar
A:	and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and,
B:	Sure.
A:	I think they're cutting us off.
B:	No,
B:	that's
A:	Oh.
B:	somebody's trying to cut in on my line
B:	and I don't want to answer.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I'll just wait.
A:	Okay.
B:	No,
B:	I've, I've got incoming calls
B:	and I don't know why, calling.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I, I hate to cut it off,
B:	I think they would cut us off,
A:	I understand.
B:	so we'll just wait.
A:	Okay,
A:	well
B:	Whoever it is will call back.
A:	they'll cut us off pretty soon.
B:	Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know,
B:	jeez.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	Actually, it's my son,
B:	I know it is.
B:	My older boy. He never likes to come home from school.
B:	Anyway that's what we have,
B:	and I have, I've tried to start a fish tank
A:	How does,
B:	and I keep losing all my fish.
A:	In the salt water?
A:	Salt water or,
B:	No
A:	Yeah.
B:	just regular water.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.
B:	Well, they've, uh, statewide raises,
B:	they raise ours it seems like constantly.
B:	We just, uh, passed a new one, uh,
B:	fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines.
A:	Oh, right
A:	Indianapolis got that, didn't they?
B:	Right.
B:	And, uh, we had passed a, a provisional one that if, if it did, if they did locate here we would raise our taxes.
B:	But, uh, at least we thought we'd get something back from that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, how do you feel about taxes?
A:	Well, it seems like a big politics game
A:	like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election
A:	so he said the budget was fine,
A:	the state didn't have any money
A:	and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money
A:	so they raised all our taxes.
A:	And now it's election time again
A:	so they're trying to lower them.
B:	Oh.
A:	So they're just talk about lowering them
A:	but they never do,
A:	they just keep raising them.
B:	I've never seen taxes really go down.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me neither.
A:	Well, actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long
A:	so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year
A:	and they're going to lower it for next year.
B:	Oh.
A:	I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.
B:	I hope they put that in writing
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	they say they're going to lower,
A:	but I'll see.
B:	I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share
B:	and of course the poor can't afford it either,
B:	but, uh, I really feel like
B:	and, and I feel like, you know,
B:	I'm a middle class person income wise anyway
B:	and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so do I.
A:	I mean, I'm a, a middle class barely,
A:	but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying less, not enough,
A:	I think they're paying too much.
B:	You think the rich are paying too much?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month, well, that's ridiculous.
A:	Why bother working?
B:	Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to,
B:	I mean, I'm talking about the really rich.
A:	Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.
B:	Right.
A:	That would be fair.
B:	Now I'll go along with that. You know,
A:	Yeah
A:	no loopholes or anything.
A:	Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.
B:	Right.
B:	Now, I think that would be fair.
A:	Right.
B:	And I, you know,
B:	no, no ifs, ands and buts, you know,
B:	no big elaborate laws that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.
B:	It's just, you know, you make this, you pay ten percent.
B:	If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,
B:	if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the way our state tax is here.
A:	I think it's pretty fair.
B:	Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.
A:	Oh
B:	So, and, and you withhold no matter what you do,
B:	they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough.
A:	Oh, great,
A:	so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.
B:	Right,
B:	so now, you know, when you sign your W-Four form or whatever, W-Two whatever that is, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state. Which is ridiculous,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess you have to check yes
A:	or you come down to the end of the year
A:	and you don't have it to give it to them.
B:	Right,
B:	unless you have a lot of deductions.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.
A:	Really?
B:	And you end up owing, you know,
B:	you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal
B:	and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state.
A:	Ouch
B:	And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.
B:	But, I, I don't know.
B:	I've,
B:	they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in, in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'll say
B:	I mean twenty-five percent increase.
A:	is,
A:	Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff.
A:	I've, read a lot of the, the, uh, astronomy books and, and stuff like that. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?
A:	Uh, to a degree.
A:	I haven't kept up as, uh, much as I would like,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've just been so busy, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh,
B:	it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans
B:	and, uh, yeah,
B:	I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,
A:	or right now
A:	but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
B:	Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.
A:	I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree. Uh,
B:	as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,
B:	and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's amazing, you know,
B:	you,
B:	it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know,
A:	he's one of the comedians
A:	and and, you know, he, he talks a lot on, on Velcro.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I've seen him before.
A:	what would we do without it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	we were talking about that just the other day.
B:	What did we do without it back then?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up .
A:	I know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,
A:	concentrated foods for one maybe
A:	I Uh, I don't know
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	it's also just I've, I've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to, to see, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.
A:	It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about.
B:	I agree.
B:	You know like you say we're used to finite things
B:	and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	But, uh, yeah,
B:	I would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, enjoy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me too.
B:	I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.
A:	Huh.
A:	I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.
B:	Oh, sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	Of course.
B:	That's true.
A:	There must be some better better way of doing this.
A:	A better place to be or whatever, you know
A:	it's,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you, you are always looking for something better.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	I know at work, uh, people always complain to me
A:	I, well, you are always whining
A:	and, it's, I'm always looking for something better. Uh,
B:	Yeah
A:	There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
B:	And if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because if
A:	Well, they are always finding easier ways
A:	and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they are doing it you know, unconsciously.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.
B:	I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
B:	but
B:	it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.
B:	You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,
B:	you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you just don't think about them.
A:	Right.
B:	And that's true.
B:	I think, uh, you know,
B:	we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,
B:	So how many, um, credit cards do you have?
A:	Um, I think I'm down to one.
B:	Oh, my gosh,
B:	I wish I was that way.
B:	Is that why you said I had more experience than you?
A:	Well, no.
A:	I was pulling your leg.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well, how, how do you use your credit card?
B:	I mean, do you just keep it in reserve,
B:	or.
A:	I, I, well,
A:	the way I'd like to try and use it is, um, you, you, you make your purchases at, at prime buying time
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you pay that off and don't use it until, uh, it's paid off.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's, that's my ideal way
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How, how do you use it?
A:	Emergencies come along,
A:	and I and I use it.
B:	Yeah
B:	that's understandable, exactly.
A:	Uh, like, uh, my car, uh, had a major problem, and seven hundred dollars,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and uh, things just come up
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Well, actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have
B:	Um, and I use them, you know,
B:	like my American Express I use for, you know, gas, things like that,
B:	and I pay that off monthly,
B:	and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you know, I do have them up there a little bit,
B:	but, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I try not to use them too often.
B:	But living in this area, uh, like I live fifteen miles west of Washington, D C
A:	Um.
B:	it's a very expensive area
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I, I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards,
A:	and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble
B:	Right.
A:	so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and got out of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card,
B:	or?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there.
B:	Uh-huh. Um.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Our, our only credit card is Sears,
A:	so and I have that for automotive purposes.
B:	Uh-huh, um.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Well, well that's great.
B:	Um, everyone I know here uses, um, credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's just too easy, basically, uh, just get yourself in trouble with those.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the only other one I have,
B:	I have like a Diner's Club through my, um, where I work
A:	I see.
B:	so that I use, because I travel some.
B:	So I use that,
B:	and I don't really have to worry about that, because I only use it for business,
B:	so I automatically have the money to pay it off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But. Um.
A:	Uh, I wouldn't mind, uh, you know, getting back into one if they would, you know,
A:	you start out at a low limit,
A:	and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that, then that's fine,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but they
A:	eventually gets up there to five thousand, ten thousand, whatever fifty thousand
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	forget it,
A:	I don't want that.
B:	Um, the temptation's too great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um.
A:	So, I don't know,
A:	just, uh,
A:	writing checks is just as easy I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	that's true,
B:	but. So, I guess, uh, we've kind of exhausted this, uh, topic
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, really,
A:	what, what can you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can't say too much about it really.
A:	Other than, you use them or you don't use them.
A:	You like them
A:	or you don't like them.
A:	So.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess, uh, they don't care if we end it early.
A:	So, uh, hopefully, uh, you have a good Thanksgiving.
A:	That's coming up,
A:	and. And, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.
B:	Okay,
B:	you, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	may be,
B:	you're the furthest person, actually, that I've talked.
B:	I've talked to a lot of people in Texas.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Texas is the big one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so.
A:	Okay, then.
A:	Well, bye now.
B:	okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	So, how do you feel about capital punishment?
B:	Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment  penalties.
A:	Right,
A:	you don't think,
B:	Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know,
B:	I mean, there is things that
B:	seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do.
B:	Now, you know, I mean somebody, a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,
B:	you kind of,
B:	I don't know.
B:	What about yourself?
A:	I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh,
A:	it's, you know, it seems right sometimes
A:	and then other times, you don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	I mean, people, like,
B:	I,
B:	it's been,
B:	I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having effective, effective punishments
B:	and, and they're extremely severe.
B:	Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because you never know if it's going to be applied. Right,
B:	unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand
B:	and  and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand
A:	Right.
B:	and everybody knows exactly what, what for.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,
B:	or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,
A:	I mean, sure, their life is taken,
A:	but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,
A:	so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
A:	so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the for the you know, what they've done.
B:	some people,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,
B:	it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. To keep people in jail.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...
A:	Right,
A:	but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,
A:	so uh, it's,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	it doesn't,
A:	it seems by, that by,
A:	I don't know,
A:	doesn't ever really, uh ...
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	I mean, you can't,
B:	it doesn't,  Taking , taking one more life doesn't, doesn't, doesn't get things back the way they were, right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	It doesn't bring back every,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't know, I, I don't, I really don't know, uh,
A:	What state are you in?
B:	I'm in Texas.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	In Dallas?
B:	No,
B:	I'm in Austin.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Where, where are you calling from?
A:	Uh, right now I'm in Utah,
A:	but I'm from Plano, Texas.
B:	Oh, I see,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, uh, what are the laws like in Texas?
B:	It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the well,
B:	I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment.
B:	Uh, Texas has had it for a while.
B:	It's one of the quickest,
B:	it, it,
B:	once it was, it was reallowed,
B:	I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution
B:	and it seems like everybody stopped
B:	and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	They do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I'm originally from Kansas
B:	and in Kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment
B:	and, uh, there they do it by hanging.
A:	Wow.
B:	Still, uh, they have,
B:	I still remember the, the, the movie, uh, IN COLD BLOOD.
B:	I don't know if you've ever,
B:	I'm sure you're familiar with it,
B:	but, have you seen the movie?
A:	I haven't,
A:	no.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That way.
A:	And they do it that way?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, they, they show it,
B:	not, not,
B:	I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that
A:	Huh.
B:	and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,
B:	but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows.
B:	It's kind of a barn like structure.
A:	Wow.
A:	I think they're there,
A:	I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in in Utah also.
A:	I'm not really familiar.
B:	Is that right?
B:	Are you there in school?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I am.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, but I think they
A:	a long time ago, I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns
A:	and one of them has the real gun in it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	has, has a,
B:	yeah.
A:	So they don't know who killed,
B:	Has a real bullets
B:	and the rest of them have blanks?
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,
B:	I know that
A:	Yeah,
A:	no.
B:	I've always said that if I, if I had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.
A:	I know.
B:	As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, I guess.
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know.
B:	The question is, I mean, would I want to buy,
B:	or would I, would I probably actually buy.
B:	May be two different things.
A:	Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.
B:	If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.
B:	No,
B:	in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.
B:	I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche Turbo .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I maybe would buy a B M W. Uh, or, or even a Volvo.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you have now?
B:	I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's actually the first car we ever bought new.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we just, we, well, I have
A:	my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah
B:	me too
B:	So what car do you drive?
B:	What is it?
A:	Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	we almost bought one of those.
B:	Do you like it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do,
A:	and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,
A:	and I,
A:	some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,
A:	and mine is a standard
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it had a lot more pickup and everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.
A:	Um
A:	usually AVIS.
B:	To what, AVIS?
A:	AVIS.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
B:	I guess,
A:	It's just because we're on,
A:	I think of it,
A:	I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,
A:	but we have corporate contracts you know, with the various companies
B:	I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it depends on your destination, too.
B:	Right.
A:	Kind of strange
B:	You work for a big company, then.
A:	Work for T I. Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this
B:	T I, I see.
B:	Uh-huh. Um,
B:	but yeah,
B:	I, I, uh, I don't know,
B:	I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Maybe it would,
B:	one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Um, and it really saved us some big money once.
A:	It did, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,
B:	and I had to pay twenty five for the,
A:	Oh, that was great.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was.
A:	That's unusual to hear,
A:	usually, you know something breaks,
A:	you look at the warranty
A:	and it's excluded.
B:	Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.
A:	Oh, I see,
A:	okay.
A:	Oh, you got your money's worth.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we did,
B:	but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,
B:	and of course I'm glad I did it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is good.
B:	But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I've been lucky.
A:	Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
B:	Oh, no.
A:	but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.
B:	Bumper?
B:	Oh.
A:	It didn't actually dent the car or anything.
A:	So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,
B:	Well, that was good.
A:	and the store will pay for it anyway,
B:	Are you.
A:	so. No big deal.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?
A:	Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that's a Legend
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	those are nice .
A:	um, but it's, it's a used one
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,
A:	and the fact that, you know, this this car that I have has performed so well,
A:	and before that I also had an Accord,
A:	it was a real old one
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I bought that used.
A:	I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,
A:	and it served me real well, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.
B:	Right.
A:	And.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my sister drives one.
B:	She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it Legend
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's a,
B:	I'm not certain,
B:	but she's liked it. Um,
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, I, I have, I have never had,
B:	and we,
B:	in fact, what I'm driving right now,
B:	we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,
B:	and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo just to be a little, you know, little car that I could care less about
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How did it go for you?
B:	Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.
A:	Hasn't left you stranded.
B:	I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,
B:	it's just a, it's a cheap little little car just to go, you know, run around town in
A:	Yeah
A:	I know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive.
B:	I, I,
B:	you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know
A:	Really.
B:	it's like too, too mushy,
B:	and it, you know it's an automatic,
A:	Huh.
B:	and
A:	Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend
B:	it's too,
B:	the steering
A:	it's windy.
B:	you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,
B:	it's kind of,
A:	I can't drive that,
A:	the Legend, it's just so huge.
B:	Oh.
A:	I, I don't like it,
A:	and it's so, uh,
A:	So, uh, what kind of home repair work have you done?
B:	Well, um, done a little, uh, repair on the, uh, shingles on the roof recently.
B:	We've had a lot of wind around here.
A:	Been pulling them up, huh, or just loosening them until the rain came in?
B:	Yes.
B:	It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again, because we may have a leak.
A:	Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain?
B:	We've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio,
B:	but, uh, well, I'm right,
B:	Plano's just north of Dallas
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now, I guess,
B:	I saw on the news.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But you're probably, what, about halfway across the state from San Antonio, though, aren't you?
B:	Well, we're up, uh, we're north and, uh, oh, about, uh, I don't know, uh, eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line, I guess.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay.
A:	But you're still getting a good bit of the rain, though.
B:	Uh, we did have a little bit of rain yesterday.
B:	So far we haven't had any today.
B:	And, uh, I suppose that means I should be, uh, getting up there to look at that, uh, shingle,
B:	but, uh I had something else planned today,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I guess I'll let it go awhile.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it asphalt shingles,
A:	or, or .
B:	They're, uh,
B:	no,
B:	they're, uh, wood shake.
A:	Ooh,
A:	that should be a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah
A:	Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them?
B:	No,
B:	I,
B:	uh, as a matter of fact, we've never had a leak actually yet.
B:	Now this,
B:	we just bought the house last year,
B:	and, uh, uh, just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles.
B:	So, I've just recently had to start looking at it myself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's a small problem so far,
B:	but I guess you just have to keep on top of it.
B:	What kind of roof do you have?
A:	Uh, we're in, uh, campus apartment buildings with flat top, uh.
B:	Oh, then you don't have to do too much with it
A:	Not too much.
A:	They're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof, or is it pretty steep?
B:	Oh, it's pretty steep.
B:	Uh, parts of it are steeper than others.
A:	What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal?
B:	Well, uh, you wear, uh, shoes with good traction, and, and, and try to remember where you are at all times
A:	Yeah,
A:	I imagine, I imagine.
B:	And remember to yell Geronimo, if all else fails.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that would be just too much of a fall for me.
A:	Um, have you been, uh,
A:	was, was the house reasonably new,
A:	or you been doing some remodeling work on it.
B:	It's actually just twelve years old, now.
A:	That's pretty new house yet.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, uh,
B:	this part of the country,
B:	actually, they say that when the house is, uh, fifteen, it's already old,
B:	but just take good care of it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Thing is,
B:	we've, uh, the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some, uh, squirming, I call it, of the foundation.
B:	We're just on a concrete slab, you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, the soil right under this is a clay,
B:	and it, uh,
A:	It's settling unevenly?
B:	Well, it, uh, depending on its moisture content, it either swells up or shrinks,
B:	and, uh of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from, uh, from, uh, drooping
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, but anytime there's a change in the weather, like the temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, uh, moisture, uh, you get little spider web cracks all around, uh, windows and doors.
A:	Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
B:	Well, usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped,
B:	and then you patch them up
A:	Um. What is it like, uh, stucco walls or,
B:	Uh, well, this is all, uh, it's all drywall
A:	Oh, drywall.
B:	uh, I think, with, uh
A:	Wood framing?
B:	yeah,
B:	right.
A:	Okay.
B:	But, uh, somehow or other that does manage to, uh, show these little cracks.
B:	I don't know quite how that works.
B:	Maybe it isn't drywall.
B:	I don't really know.
A:	they plastered over drywall.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it is.
A:	I remember my parents home is drywalled and then they, uh, almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look,
B:	I expect that's what it is,
B:	yeah.
A:	and made for kind of a hard shell on the, on the drywall.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's the way this is done.
B:	Fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet
B:	so I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would, that would be in terribly, terribly exasperating to have the, the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that.
B:	Yes,
B:	well, the previous owner had a major problem with it, because, uh, oh probably a variety of things.
B:	His neighbor used,
A:	return anything.
B:	Well, really,  the only things that I have returned have not been faulty,
B:	it's been because of the size or  some problem like that.
A:	Right.
B:	I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to.
A:	Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee,
A:	yeah.
A:	The only thing I've had lately is, uh, my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for, uh, Christmas
A:	and, uh, it takes them less than a day
A:	and they're broken in one way or another.
A:	But I don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, uh,
A:	maybe those type of products should be for older kids
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What age are your children?
A:	I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And, uh, I don't think they're unduly rough,
A:	but maybe they are.
A:	I don't know.
A:	But, uh, a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces
A:	and they're easily lost and easily broken
A:	but,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, my daughter is twenty-one now,
B:	so it's been a while since we've had Barbie things
A:	It's been a while since they've, uh, gone through the Barbie stuff .
B:	But we did have Barbies, we did have Barbies and things,
B:	and there
B:	seems to me that that became a craze when she was already, oh, like, you know, third, fourth, fifth grade.
A:	Right.
B:	So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it,
B:	but, uh, I don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff.
A:	Don't remember her breaking, uh,
B:	No,
B:	I don't.
B:	But I also don't remember lots of little pieces
B:	They've got so many different things with it now.
A:	Well, that's one thing they've got.
A:	They've got every type of imaginable,
A:	camping on the beach, and all of these come with, oh, like tiny, tiny little plates and little sunglasses.
A:	And, uh
B:	Goodness.
A:	my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll,
A:	and so I finally got her a Ken doll,
A:	and, uh, less than a week later the arm was broken.
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	But they were real good about replacing it.
A:	That's one nice thing, is they're real good about replacing it.
B:	Well, uh, I guess if they'll replace them, then they assume they shouldn't have broken.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, the, the, you know, those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
A:	and
B:	Any direction.
A:	she's not that strong, that I would  she's not that big of a girl that I think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The main thing that they've, they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes.
A:	Yes.
B:	You know, that was about it.
A:	That was about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
A:	but,
B:	And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics.
B:	My, my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight.
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Uh-huh
B:	and,
A:	Well, do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?
B:	No,
B:	not really.
B:	We, uh, haven't had that much, you know, problem with things that we have bought.
B:	They seem to, to last.
B:	In fact, when they offer us extended warranties, we, we don't buy them because we've,
A:	Don't buy them because you don't need them.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, it seems like it's just a, an added tack on.
B:	Plus a lot of the credit cards now, you know, will guarantee,
B:	if you purchase on your credit card  you know, then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time,
A:	Oh, yeah. .
B:	so it seems  like it's a waste of money.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it, it's usually before that warranty would expire
A:	any,
A:	the first one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And like I've even bought, on a recliner once I bought, you know, a, a, an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that,
B:	and I never used it.
A:	You never even needed it.
B:	And so it seems ridiculous.
B:	And like washers and dryers and things like that, I've never had one go out.
B:	In fact, they usually,
B:	when they do go out, it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix
B:	and we don't even have a repairman come,
B:	or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing.
A:	It's time to replace it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	So, I mean,
A:	I think these extended warranties are gimmicks, really.
B:	I do too.
A:	A lot of it.
A:	We bought, when we first married, we bought one on our T V
A:	and that there's,
A:	it was a five year, after the first five years,
A:	and it was ridiculous.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they charge you a pretty good price for them too.
A:	Yes.
A:	They're a pretty healthy price,
A:	and you're trying to think oh, maybe I'll need this.
A:	You never, you always think gosh, if I say no, then I won't, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But,
B:	Well, my husband  finally just put his foot down
A:	I don't know.
B:	and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore,
B:	and if it goes out, well  you know.
A:	You probably  got your worth out of it anyway.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and, uh, so we really have been fairly happy with things,
B:	but now we take good care of things
B:	and we don't, uh, run out and buy a lot of, of things either.
B:	And since our kids aren't little anymore, I'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken.
A:	Yes,
A:	the little,
A:	well, you probably are real careful of the brands you buy
A:	and the, when you do buy things, you probably watch what kind of, type of .
B:	Well, you look at the consumer guide.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, you go around
B:	and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the,
A:	So, uh, what do you think about child care
B:	Oh, well, my, my feelings on it is, uh, I wouldn't take a child to day-care You know?
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, I'd, I'd wind up, uh,
B:	just a baby-sitter in a home.
A:	Probably find someone,
A:	how come you wouldn't take them to a day-care?
B:	Uh,
A:	Just because of the,
B:	Well, too many kids and, and I think too many infections and things coming in.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they seem to pass a lot of,
B:	Yeah,
B:	sicknesses and
B:	I don't know,
B:	then all the things you hear about them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you kind of wonder whether or not,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean I'm sure there's some good ones,
B:	but I just,
B:	I don't think that I would, uh,
A:	I took, uh, Cammy to a oh,
A:	it was a preschool day-care type of thing.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	But I kind of, I liked it some ways
A:	and some ways I didn't
A:	Uh, I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And,
B:	How was it?
A:	Well, I think they had a, they had two teachers
A:	and I think there were twenty kids,
A:	but I only had her going two days
A:	and most of the other kids were going more days
A:	so that was probably my own fault that she didn't,
B:	Oh.
B:	She went,
A:	Oh, you know, one thing I noticed is, uh, uh, just, they were trying to get her to, teach her to write her name,
A:	and, uh, I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way, oh, not in a natural form.
B:	Oh, she did?
A:	Yes,
A:	and, uh, I was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and, either pointed it out to me or, or, uh tried to say, look, you're holding your,
A:	she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff.
A:	but she was,
B:	Wrapping her arm all the way around.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point.
A:	She was four, or three,
A:	yeah,
A:	she was, uh, it was last year
A:	and, uh, then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on
A:	and I
A:	like I said, I didn't notice it till then. Because I hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they'd never picked it out, though?
A:	No.
B:	Huh.
A:	They never,
B:	Or just never said anything.
A:	Course, like I said, I took her two days a week
A:	and maybe that was,
A:	my main reason for taking her was, uh, just social skills more than anything else.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I felt she needed the
A:	just, I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Well, one thing that's kind of different, too, though, a preschool than, than taking a, a infant or to at a day-care where they're taken care of.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know.
A:	Preschool's a different thing,
A:	but I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and, or unless you have awfully good references. Reliable, uh, people,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long.
B:	Well, I think it's hard to leave them,
B:	it is.
A:	It is.
A:	The older ones it's not,
A:	you don't even really have any real worries, because you know that they'll play with whoever's there
A:	and they usually adapt pretty well.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it is, I think, just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will.
A:	Well, and you know their, kind of their schedules
A:	and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I don't know how, uh, people, uh, that have young kids working work full time and, and do it, really, without being stressed out all the time.
A:	I think it's, well,
A:	I don't know,
A:	then, then on the other hand I think it's harder to stay home in some regards.
A:	It's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive,
A:	and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess,
A:	and you haven't got anything done
A:	and
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	what am I going to fix for supper
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it is
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's kind of hard to always feel gosh,
A:	what,
A:	is this important what I'm doing
A:	and
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, uh, the work never ends.
A:	No.
B:	That's for sure.
A:	No,
A:	it, It doesn't.
B:	So,
B:	Huh.
A:	But, I think for taking kids to a, probably people that take them to, uh, preschools and day-cares full time, oh,
A:	they would, I don't know, probably just feel a different, uh,
A:	I think, I just think it would be hard to do that full time.
A:	I feel such a responsibility, even when we go out for a few hours that,
A:	are they driving the baby-sitter crazy
A:	and you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	or is everything okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	Donna, um, you said you have three children.
A:	What, uh, kinds of activities do you spend with them?
A:	Is it ?
B:	Okay,
B:	um, we have an eleven year old, an eight year old, and a three year old
B:	and, um,  uh, my husband, let's see, he coaches basketball with Brian, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so he spends time doing that with him, planning and, um, practicing outside.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, he's a real sports kind of person,
B:	so he plays tennis with, with the kids.
B:	We all kind of play tennis as a family,
B:	except the baby plays in the playground.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We take turns with her.
B:	Um, uh, let's see,
B:	we have a computer
B:	and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer.
B:	Um, uh, let's what else we do.
B:	Oh, plus we watch a little T V together.
B:	We really don't watch, I think, as much T V as a lot of people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We don't have H B O.
B:	We do get the Disney channel for the kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, my kids have a Nintendo which they play,
B:	and my husband sometimes joins them with that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, my little girl, Jennifer, likes to do crafty things,
B:	and I'll take some time and do that with her.
B:	And, of course, we always read a bedtime story at night,
B:	and even the, the older kids sometimes sit down and, and will join in and listen to a story.
B:	I'm,  basically the story person because my husband doesn't have,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he gets home from work late or whatever
B:	and, and usually, once in a while he'll read the story to little one,
B:	but that's basically my job
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um
A:	So do you find it difficult to find time,
A:	or is it pretty natural ?
B:	It is. It is hard because, you know, at the end of your day you want time for yourself
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and it,
B:	and that's kind of cutting into your, your time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine.
B:	They go upstairs at nine,
B:	and, um, now, this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come
B:	and, uh, my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home and, um, probably not too late.
A:	Uh-huh .
B:	Maybe Brian will still be up, and spend some time with him.
B:	But it, it's really hard.
B:	You have to be a very unselfish person to, to spend a lot of time with your kids, I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Do you work during the day?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I don't work.
B:	I, last year, um, I had a little part time job in a private, um, high school, tutoring, um, high school students with learning disabilities.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was two days a week,
B:	and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot.
B:	I don't know how,
B:	I admire,  people that, that can do it all,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept, it is hard.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I can imagine.
B:	Um.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And that's another thing,
B:	I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping, um, usually on the weekend,
B:	and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son,
B:	and they'll be my helper,
B:	and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out
B:	so, I try to do things like that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but it, you know, it's, it's, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then, of course, they have a pretty, um, busy social calendar too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You fit it in with all that, that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general, you know, in America?
B:	I, I think a lot of people, a lot of people set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and, and,  kind of leave them to their own means. Um,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think, you know, it's very, very easy to fall into that trap,
B:	and I'm not, um, totally innocent of that because,  there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, um, um, I think different parts of the country,
B:	I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids.
B:	People are,  real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids, sports activities and,
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	You know, but, um,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, families are facing a challenge,
A:	I know that with,
B:	What,
A:	I'm a newlywed
A:	and we're you know, thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's, it's very hard, because when you get used to two salaries, it's very hard to, to cut back to one.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, um, um, but, you know, if you have the type of job,
B:	I have a friend that's a nurse
B:	and she can pick her hours
B:	and
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that's a, a great career.
B:	I wish I would have gone into, uh, nursing
A:	Yeah.
B:	because she has such a flexible schedule,
B:	but it's very hard to, uh, spend time with the children and, uh, and your husband and do everything at once.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because ,
B:	Well, I think it's a big, it's a big, um, responsibility.
B:	You just don't,  have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	When you have children, you have to say, now, this is different
B:	and you do have to give things up.
B:	I, I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child, um, for the,  at least for the first two years of their lives. I mean, if you,  can possibly swing it
B:	because they,
B:	Do you have kids?
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	I got three.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Uh, we have two and another one on the way.
A:	Oh, you have got, uh, young children then.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	uh, we do,
B:	we have, uh, a six year old.
B:	He is oldest
B:	and then, uh, our baby will be a year on Monday.
A:	Oh my goodness.
A:	That is great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What kind of mix do you have?
A:	A boy and a girl?
B:	Two boys.
A:	Two boys.
B:	Two boys
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you know what is on the way yet?
A:	Are you
B:	No.
B:	I am just about three months,
B:	and, uh, I don't think we really even want to find out.
A:	I do not blame you
B:	We like surprises.
B:	So We will take either.
A:	Well, we have got two boys and a girl also.
A:	Well, we have got two boys and a girl
B:	And, uh, does it,
B:	are the two boys first?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	Maybe, maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time.
B:	Maybe, huh.
B:	We, we kind of like our boys though too,
B:	so
A:	Well, our boys, one, is, uh, he is in graduate school at A and M, uh,
A:	he is in the Navy.
A:	He is a lieutenant in the Navy
A:	and the Navy is sending him for his Masters in Ocean Engineering
B:	Oh my goodness.
A:	and we have got another boy that is, us, out in Maryland.
A:	He is a wildlife biologist, uh,
A:	and our girl is thirteen.
A:	She is in the seventh grade.
A:	So, we have got, still, all sorts of good activities since,
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	You kind of got, uh, a span there, huh?
B:	Oh, well what do you do with your seventh grader?
A:	Well, she is into a little bit of everything.
A:	She is, uh, loves riding horses
A:	so she goes out riding as much as she can.
B:	Do you have horses?
A:	No
B:	She, just, she knows people that does, huh?
A:	Well, that,
A:	yeah
A:	but maybe that riding place that is North of town that she goes to.
A:	She rides English, and does jumping, takes lesson and all that kind of stuff.
B:	Oh, does she?
B:	Oh.
B:	She must really like them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	she is into, uh,
A:	well she plays the flute in the band, and, the piccolo,
A:	and she is into this, uh, odyssey of the mind thing, which is, uh, takes a lot of time, for, uh,
A:	it
A:	a
A:	what they call peace group.
A:	I don't know if you have gotten into that with your kids,
A:	but that is where the, kind of,
A:	well it is a program for Advanced kids.
B:	Advanced.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I have heard about it.
B:	Our little boy is in the first grade
B:	and I, I taught school for six years.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, I do know about that program
B:	and
A:	Well, my wife is involved
A:	and she kind of heads that up for these kids,
A:	and last year they, they, got, uh, the state level.
A:	They did not win that,
A:	but they, uh, got one local and, uh, one region,
A:	and they got a new mix of kids this time.
A:	So, it keeps them busy.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	It keeps them busy.
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	I bet.
B:	Huh, well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with, with, uh, other kids that are involved in this?
A:	Well, uh, yes,
A:	but they, well they have,
A:	well you probably know a peace group that, uh, that they are advanced type. That they are special, well, uh, classes for peace classes.
A:	I think that, uh this happens to be, uh, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	history is what their peace class is this year.
A:	But, uh, so.
B:	Oh. Uh-huh.
A:	They, uh, she enjoys that kind of stuff and, uh, does well with it.
B:	Oh, how neat.
A:	So yeah.
B:	Challenging, huh?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Always something to do
B:	Well, uh, as far as our activities, we are kind of on a different level here.
B:	But, my
A:	Well, you will get to different levels.
A:	I guarantee it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	My husband is going to take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight.
A:	Uh, okay.
B:	They like to, uh
A:	That will be fun.
B:	both boy things
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but we, we, do not have any real, uh,
B:	like we don't really ski.
B:	We have not taken our kids skiing or anything.
B:	Of course, the baby is young,
B:	but
A:	Got to wait a couple years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Sledding, that is what you have got to do.
A:	Tobogganing.
B:	The what?
A:	You have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them.
B:	Oh, well yeah,
B:	we, we have done that.
B:	He, in fact, he just goes right out here.
B:	We have got quite a bit of snow, uh,
B:	last week we got a lot.
A:	Well you are welcome to keep that
B:	Yeah
B:	You would like that, huh?
A:	Well, I grew up in Wisconsin,
A:	I, I had plenty of snow,
A:	and when I was a kid,
B:	Oh.
A:	and we have lived here about seventeen years,
A:	but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating, and all of that kind of stuff
B:	Yeah.
A:	it is fun really.
B:	It is fun.
A:	As long as you do not have to drive in it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I,
B:	no,
B:	I do not like that.
B:	I,
B:	really, it makes me nervous.
B:	Yeah
A:	I had plenty of snow to last me forever.
A:	I, I don't care if I ever see any,
A:	well, I don't care if I ever see it,
A:	but keep it off of here
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	Well, uh, I don't mind it,
B:	but, uh, uh, the winter gets long.
A:	Yes.
B:	You know, I get ready, that,
B:	come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start getting spring,
B:	and, it is too early yet.
A:	Well, you have got, You have got five months before you will see that
B:	Yeah,
B:	we do, we do.
B:	We have had a few early springs though in the last few years.
B:	They have not been too bad.
B:	Come about March, it gets, you know, a lot nicer.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Out oldest son. When, uh,
A:	Okay.
A:	You probably, uh, more up on this subject than I am,
A:	but, the roles that women have played in the last couple of year in our, or couple of generations.
B:	That,
B:	Right.
B:	Well, they've entered the work force more, uh, you know, since World War Two is when they started.
A:	You bet.
B:	And, uh, I think that that is, you know, very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women.
A:	You bet.
A:	You know, where I've noticed it more, I think, is,
A:	I'm a traveling salesperson
A:	and I have traveled most of my life
A:	and I know just especially in the last, oh, ten years and really since,
A:	in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers.
A:	I sell sporting goods
A:	and even in our industry, uh, there was virtually, really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell
A:	and even in the last five or six years, boy we see more and more women being involved
A:	and, you know, it's a, it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the,
B:	you see more of that, you see more of them, uh, leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel, too.
A:	You bet.
B:	You know, I, I go to a, I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that,
B:	you know, one of the girls travels quite extensively
B:	and she says, well, my children have two parents.
B:	You know, why not
A:	You bet.
A:	That's sort of neat.
B:	So that, that's a, I think that's a change
B:	and I think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the, in the future, people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing.
A:	Sure.
A:	I think, uh, it's the age old thing,
A:	every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on T V or something where the discussion comes out that, you know, women are paid less than men
A:	and they're, and they're doing the same, uh, or carrying the same job responsibility
B:	Right.
A:	and, you know, I, that's a very true statement
A:	and it shouldn't, uh, it shouldn't be that way. You know.
B:	No.
B:	That, that I think should change, will change in the near future also.
A:	I think so, hope so,
B:	It's been changing,
B:	it's been evolving,
B:	but there's still a, an, an inequality in the work forces or jobs.
A:	Absolutely.
B:	It's, you know,
A:	You know, I've,
B:	And you hear some people say, you know,
B:	well, he's a man,
B:	he, he, he needs that salary.
A:	Right
A:	Yeah,
A:	they forget.
A:	Also, I think, uh, a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know,
A:	if a,
A:	a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever.
B:	Right.
A:	So, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way.
A:	But, I guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as I mentioned, was just in traveling,
A:	you see, uh, more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and, uh, and in their business suits and and going.
B:	And going,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now.
A:	That's a good, a good statement.
A:	And I think if,
A:	in the future it's even going to be, uh, more noticeable and more significant.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think it will be.
B:	I think, I, well,
B:	another thing I read, too, the other day,
B:	this is not just for working women
B:	but how much they're out there, I guess is
B:	the car designers, uh, are starting to design cars with women in mind. Uh, because in the past the male bought the cars,
B:	but now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases. And that they are looking for, uh, different things in the car.
A:	Wow.
B:	The man is looking for the in the engine
B:	and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel. Uh, can her makeup come off the upholstery
A:	You bet.
A:	Good point.
B:	And if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out that are self sufficient and, you know, mobile and working.
A:	Right now I'm self employed
A:	and, and my wife's always worked.
A:	She's a schoolteacher,
A:	but for,
A:	she started working
A:	and then when I first started my business, uh,
A:	she was selling real estate at the time
A:	and hers was the only income we had for three or four months
A:	so,
B:	Right.
A:	You know, she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business
A:	and she still works everyday
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we all do.
A:	You bet.
B:	I just happen to be off today.
A:	Uh-oh.
B:	I work, too.
A:	enjoying it
A:	What kind of work do you do?
B:	I'm a nurse.
A:	Well, good.
B:	And I work at Medical Treatment Center, uh, which is at uh, Jupiter and Arapaho.
A:	Right
A:	Married?
B:	No.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I'm kind of out of, out of things.
A:	You see the old, uh, cigarette ads, you know, about you've come a long way.
B:	You've come a long way baby?
A:	Baby,
A:	right,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	You think about this when you come to, when it comes to a subject like that
A:	and it's really true.
A:	Women have come a long way
A:	and, you know,
A:	do you have a P C?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have a Macintosh S E thirty.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes.
A:	I have a, um, P C, a I B M P C myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	A two eighty-six.
A:	I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. Um.
B:	What do you use yours for mostly?
A:	Um, mostly, um, word processing applications and, uh, just as a dumb terminal.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but I, um, I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that.
A:	Um, what do you find that you use yours mostly for?
B:	Well, I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base,
B:	and, uh, about the only thing
B:	I am, uh, I'm just starting to get into, uh, a little bit more communications now.
B:	I've just today ordered a fax modem
B:	so I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you don't have to make a hard copy that way.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, are you using windows?
A:	No,
A:	I, I think I, I'm planning on like moving up, getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although, you know, I do like the, the graphical user environment.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, um,
A:	I want, I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, the one thing I used to use a, uh,
B:	I've never used an I B M actually.
B:	I used to use a, just an Apple two E, which of course is looks pretty primitive now.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school.
B:	But I don't have any, uh, any real programming capabilities on my, uh, Mac right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't have, uh, any compilers
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I'm, uh.
A:	Well, do you use your computer for, um, just things around the house, or in the .
B:	I use it in my business.
A:	Well, see, what do you do?
B:	I, uh, do, uh, consultation and, and testing of various kinds for, uh, English as a second language programs.
A:	Oh, wow.
A:	Um, and, uh, are these like, uh, do these programs, um,
A:	are, are they based on, on a, on a, um, other language,
A:	or are they based, are they based
A:	like a lot of the, um, you know, a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of, you know, parts of the world,
A:	and the teacher just tries to, tries to teach English, you know, through natural understanding.
B:	That's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You seem to be, uh, better informed than the average person on that.
A:	Well, it was just, uh, when I was high school, I worked for the community school,
A:	and they had a English second language class
A:	and it always seemed strange to me that, you know, all these, all these people that, you know, spoke English not too well, and spoke, you know, a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to, you know, you don't have as many cues,
A:	you can't, don't have hand gestures and things like that.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, now, we, uh,
B:	what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Most of the stuff that I do is not, uh, interactive
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I use it for uh, data analysis on testing,
B:	so.
A:	Uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that.
B:	Well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.
B:	So it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would imagine so.
A:	Um, so, um, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?
B:	Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly and with smaller files.
B:	I can't believe, you know, I've got, uh, five, uh, megabytes on this one now
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It, it's .
B:	and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K
A:	Yes,
A:	it's amazing, you know, how, how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much.
A:	I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you know, then, then we, then I started playing with Apples, you know,
A:	and those had forty-eight,
A:	or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty-four K.
B:	Oh, the old the old Apple, uh, the, the original Apple had, what, yeah, forty-eight I guess, didn't it.
A:	Uh, I know, I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them, is all,
A:	and
B:	My goodness.
A:	there's, I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K
A:	and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And you know it's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you,
A:	I'm not sure about Macintoshes,
A:	but I know I B M you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, that's, that's your that's the low end. Uh.
B:	Well the S P thirty goes up to eight
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.
B:	I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.
B:	I don't know.
B:	They say that system seven uses a lot of memory.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I imagine .
A:	Okay, Bill,
A:	right?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay, Bill,
A:	have you done much camping?
B:	Uh, yes.
B:	I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I camp, uh, every month, uh, camp at least one weekend
B:	and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year
A:	Oh, well, that, that sounds good.
B:	I'd say I camp quite a bit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you do.
A:	Um, now do you have a lot mountains,
A:	well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you.
A:	Where do you find places to camp?
B:	Well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
A:	Oh.
B:	and we, uh, we also, uh, carry all our equipment with us
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we canoe down the river and then, sleep on the river on one of the, um, sand bars and then get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, my word.
A:	Well that sounds adventuresome
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Well, um, I've done, oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I.
A:	Um, we have five children,
A:	and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves.
A:	So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,
A:	and we have gone up into the mountains and, uh, not necessarily roughed it,
A:	but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now,
A:	they're twelve and eleven,
A:	and so, they're involved in the scouting
A:	and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,
A:	and so this year they'll both be going,
A:	and so that's been real enjoyable for them.
B:	Great.
A:	So.
B:	What, uh, what kind of camping do they like best?
B:	Do they like it where they have tents
B:	and, uh, do they cook on stoves?
A:	Um, yes,
A:	they've, well,
A:	no,
A:	actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,
A:	and I don't think they've taken the stoves.
A:	Um, last year they camped in tents,
A:	and this year I believe they will be in tents also.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	It doesn't get very cold in Texas,
B:	so lots of times we don't even take tents.
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	We just use trail tarps.
A:	Oh, and what does that consist of?
B:	Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh, like a, uh,
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they're very light weight
B:	and we use them when we go backpacking.
B:	So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, uh,
B:	they're not very heavy, see
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so you carry them with you,
B:	and they'll keep you dry or whatever.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, see, when, when we go camping here,
A:	we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and lots of tents
A:	and, I like to sleep on the air matresses.
A:	I'm not,
A:	my bones are getting so old,
A:	so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that?
B:	yes,
B:	in fact, uh, um, last month we went camping,
B:	we saw a lot of deer uh, in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere.
A:	Oh.
A:	My word.
A:	Gee.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	so, uh, but, it, even though, uh, it wasn't hunting season,
B:	and we were with Boy Scouts,
B:	so of course we don't, uh, want to go hunting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we got to see a lot of deer um, out and about
A:	Oh.
B:	and there's,
B:	of course, we see smaller animals all the time,
B:	and, uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because, uh, we have, uh, armadillos.
A:	Oh.
B:	Do you know what  armadillo is?
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh, they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And possums, and, uh, raccoons.
A:	My word.
B:	And we have those creatures down here that they like to, uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And so that, that, uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.
A:	But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.
B:	They will if you attack them.
A:	Oh.
B:	But most time they run away from you if they, if they see you're up, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.
A:	Oh, my word
B:	So.
A:	Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears.
A:	We, we want to,
A:	music do you like?
B:	Uh, lots of different kinds I guess.
B:	Uh, I like country music, of course
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Texas
B:	and I listen to Christian music a lot because there's a Christian music station here in in our city.
B:	So I listen to it quite a bit.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	I am more into rock and roll myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I listen cause on Friday nights they have the, uh, they have what they call Saturday Night Alive
B:	or they have on Saturday night, Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So
B:	you know, they have that type of music,
B:	but they just have different words
B:	so, I listen to that too.
A:	Do you like any bluegrass?
B:	Uh, no.
B:	Not really,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I like  I like rap music.
A:	Well, at least your,
B:	Do you like rap music?
A:	Not really
B:	Not really
B:	Well, I can tell we're, we're together here
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay. Uh.
A:	Um.
A:	Uh, we'll have to, uh
B:	What kind of
A:	I have a lot of friends that like country music
B:	What kind of rock music do you listen to?
B:	Do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	I'm more into, uh, older rock, like the psychedelic era, like, uh
B:	Seventies and like that stuff.
A:	late sixties, seventies, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Greatful Dead, Crosby, Stills and Nash.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have friends that like that.
A:	What
B:	Yeah
B:	So you have never heard of like the Christian music that I listen to probably.
A:	Oh, I've heard a little bit of it.
A:	I've just,
B:	Like have you heard of, uh, of Carmen?
B:	Have you ever heard of Kim?
A:	Uh, now I've heard of Striper.
A:	So the only one I can
B:	Striper,
B:	they're the really heavy, yeah  like the heavy metal stuff  I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the first of Amy Grant before
B:	Yeah.
A:	was, you know, became more mainstream, top forty.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Cause she, she plays both secular and Christian
B:	so,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like her too.
A:	Uh,
B:	I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers.
A:	I've never actually seen her in concert.
A:	I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show.
B:	She does.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She's real good. She's real good.
B:	So, I like her.
A:	Uh-huh Uh,
A:	I like some country music.
A:	It's just that I like finding a lot of it's,
B:	I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me, my dog  left me, everybody's left me.
A:	Yeah
A:	Mama got run over by the train.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I don't like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I like Randy Travis
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, I like more of the real new ones, you know.
A:	Like Garth Brooks.
B:	Garth Brooks, oh
B:	yes,
B:	you know he's fine.
A:	Reba MacIntyre.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I like them.
B:	I don't care for the older, you know, like the dog left me stuff.
A:	You don't like Patsy Cline?
B:	Huh?
A:	You don't like Patsy Cline.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
B:	I don't even really know who she is, you know
B:	You know, so. But, have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like?
B:	That music that you like to.
A:	Uh, yeah
A:	actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about, I guess about a week ago.
B:	But aren't they done with?
B:	I thought that they
A:	No,
A:	they're they are still on tour.
A:	They have been touring, since the late sixties
B:	And I just thought that they done broke up and  left.
A:	No.
A:	They're still together.
A:	They're still  making albums.
B:	Huh.
B:	Wow,
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	That's interesting.
A:	In fact, I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around, from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	Cause they are on up there in age, aren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're, they're like late forties, early fifties,
A:	but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
B:	Okay.
B:	Alright.
A:	You know, they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players.
A:	They keep on dying
A:	and they keep on replacing them
A:	and the new one's in this thirties you know. Uh,
B:	Oh, alright.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Cause they look pretty rough.
B:	I mean, I've seen like picture of them
B:	and they just,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones.
A:	They just,
A:	I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured,
A:	but it looked like leather day at the geriatric,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean cause they just,
A:	All their faces were just all shriveled,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yuck looking, I mean
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh.
A:	I mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well are you into that that rock music, you know, all that druggy stuff and all that I mean?
A:	Well, uh
B:	You know what I am saying
B:	like, I mean like they come on the stage
B:	and like, you know, you,
B:	they don't even know they are there. You know.
B:	They are just so out of it.
A:	Actually, I prefer my, my performers to be pretty sober, you know, just uh, just so that, you know, that if they're jamming, you know, that they don't just lose themselves and you know, go into lala land.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I just don't, I just don't like you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That.
B:	So, I don't know
A:	So, uh, have you seen any concerts lately?
B:	Um. Uh,
A:	Uh, so, do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time?
B:	Generally, I don't think they are.
B:	Uh, my, my personal opinion is that, uh, the politicians are out for their own good because they, they're entrenched.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They don't ever have to go out and get a real job.
B:	They just stay in their current job,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know what I mean?
A:	I agree, uh, with, with both of those things,
A:	but, uh, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest?
B:	I think by putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but it has to be not just at the national level but at the, you know, the state and the local level, too.
B:	I know some senators,
B:	and I don't know which ones,
B:	but they've been in office since the, the nineteen forties
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I,
B:	they've never had a job.
B:	I mean they've never gone out in the real world and, and paid normal taxes.
A:	Um.
A:	So that's, uh,
B:	Yeah
B:	that's another thing
B:	I have a problem with my wife,
A:	Yeah.
B:	she, uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.
B:	She likes the chicken and fish,
A:	Uh, yeah.
B:	and, like I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know, a lot,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	so
A:	I know,
A:	my husband did too
A:	His parents are Austrian
A:	and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	red meat, plenty of good red meat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	My dad wouldn't know what to do.
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	so do you,
B:	Course, she grew up Catholic
B:	so you know, they,  they sort of come with the,
A:	Oh, they did the,
B:	there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have
A:	That you do,
A:	right,
A:	right,
A:	that's just part of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we didn't, my family didn't,
A:	but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,
A:	but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,
A:	he never,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	there were several things that he liked
A:	but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.
A:	It's just that I cooked
A:	so he had to put up with it
B:	Right.
A:	So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand
A:	and that was soybeans.
A:	I tried it like once or twice
A:	and he just could not eat it,
A:	so I never,
A:	I had,
A:	I was limited.
A:	I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,
A:	but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's hard to get a protein content up then
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's true
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like, I like them every now and then for a change,
B:	it's nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	some of the stuff is good,
A:	but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking
A:	Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we had little kids at the time, you know,
A:	when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,
A:	I couldn't, I don't like to cook.
A:	And I'm not really that great at it
A:	so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.
A:	So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.
B:	No, uh,
B:	he's all done.
A:	He's set,
A:	oh okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I set him down.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you like to bake at all,
A:	or do you, do you get into that's, that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we used to do that, um,
B:	my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know
A:	Yeah
B:	after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.
B:	But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.
A:	Really,
A:	no kidding.
B:	And, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days
B:	and that would be it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	then be gone.
A:	I know,
A:	that's the thing about baking.
A:	I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all
A:	and I, I can do a pretty good pie,
A:	we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother
A:	and my mother taught me how to make it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,
A:	but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.
A:	We had the same kind of problem.
A:	If you make homemade bread,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I mean, it's supposed to save you money
A:	but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat
A:	It tastes so good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um,
B:	you ever seen the, the starter bread,
B:	I can't remember what it's called,
B:	they call it the, um, Amish bread here
B:	but,
A:	Oh, uh, yeah.
B:	uh, it's made with,
B:	you just leave it out,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, and you let it spoil sort of.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	I've heard of that, I've heard of it,
A:	but I've never done it.
B:	You know, yeah.
A:	That sounds pretty good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it tasted pretty good, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh yeah.
B:	But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
B:	and then you add all these other ingredients to it,
B:	but.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then you you make the bread
A:	but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
B:	Yeah
B:	right,
B:	you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
B:	and that's how they continue the thing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I know, it sounds, it always sounded,
A:	I don't know how safe that was
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know it sounded strange to me too,
B:	I figure, well you're baking it
B:	so, you know, yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	that's true,
A:	that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,
A:	but.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, I'll talk to you later.
A:	All right,
A:	well, yeah
A:	thanks.
B:	Where are you calling from by the way, Texas.
A:	Plano.
B:	Where?
A:	Yeah,
A:	Plano, in Texas.
B:	Plano,
B:	okay.
A:	Are you in Texas?
B:	No,
B:	Falls Church, Virginia.
A:	No kidding,
A:	gosh it sounds so close.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know we've got a good connection,
B:	must be a, uh, T I connection,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I thought for sure, I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I talked to so many people from Texas
B:	that's where practically everybody I talked to is from.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, you know.
A:	Yes
A:	they're they're trying to get all different amount of people.
A:	Well gee, my husband is from Richmond
A:	and I went to U V A,
A:	that's where we went.
B:	Oh, oh really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	I went to school at, uh, well I went to school at West Virginia University,
A:	Oh you did,
A:	yeah.
B:	but I grew up right here in Falls Church, right outside D C.
A:	Yeah,
A:	boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast,
A:	I'll tell you.
A:	It's nice over there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's sort of funny,
B:	I have people that want to go to Dallas.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas,
B:	saying how,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	no kidding.
A:	Well, things are doing pretty good down here,
A:	we, we were, we tried to move over to Raleigh last year
A:	and there just was, there was so little, such little going on in Raleigh, you know,
A:	you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there
A:	so we decided we'll try in a couple of years,
A:	but, but business is,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you probably could, you probably could,
B:	Well Northern Virginia.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	well it's good talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
A:	Take care.
B:	Bye, bye,
A:	Bye.
A:	Well, I don't, I mean, I don't know what you think about the, subject,
A:	I'd, the, I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the, the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.
A:	I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody,
A:	and I don't know that that's not a good idea.
B:	That's not a bad idea
B:	I,
B:	um, uh, that, you know,
B:	they probably, need to change it somehow, uh,
B:	the whole system needs changing,
B:	we've just got too many people in there ,  and, uh, , are putting too many, uh, people in jail that probably don't need to be there
A:	I agree.
B:	and it's another form of sentencing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But on that one thing, I, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, um, majority vote.
B:	And that's not going to be good.
A:	I don't like that,
A:	no,
B:	No.
A:	I don't like that at all.
A:	I know my husband served on a, on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton,
A:	but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug conviction
A:	and I don't remember
A:	he had some cocaine and it was accused of selling it,
A:	and I don't remember exactly how much he had
A:	but, uh, actually not selling it ,
A:	there's a difference,
A:	couriering it is what,
A:	is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier
A:	and,  he was a courier.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, they, he's, he sat on that jury
A:	and they found him guilty,
A:	and they went through the sentencing phase and everything
A:	and, uh, you know, they were told that, you know, during the trial that this is this guy's first offense
A:	and he's got this clean record,
A:	and, and they ended up,
A:	the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time to crackdown here, you know,
A:	and it was time to do this drug thing
A:	and let's crackdown
A:	and let's really,
A:	and they sentenced him to fifteen years,  you know, which they thought first offense, okay, this is, they thought that that was, that was a good thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they sentencing him to fifteen years
A:	and, um, after it was all over, uh, the they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers, to someone in the let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers
A:	and they were told that, uh, he would probably serve three,  of the fifteen,  and that he had three previous convictions.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	However, they could not tell the the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, the jury didn't know about it,
A:	so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,
B:	Sure .
A:	and so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson
A:	but it's not just, you know, horrible,  since it was first offense
B:	Yeah .
A:	and he'd been convicted three times before, you know,
B:	Oh .
A:	and, and the jury was very upset
A:	and my husband came home, a home, very upset,
A:	I mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	and so something,
A:	I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the judge might know
B:	or at least it, it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,
B:	if it didn't we can come back for something else
B:	or,
A:	That's true.
A:	That's very true.
B:	or, or what we've got,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, we definitely need a change in the system
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	obviously what we are doing is not working, you know.
B:	It's not working, too .
A:	No.
B:	It's just piling up on us.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and there's, you know, there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,
B:	Right.
A:	and either they're in there,  forever or when they get out they're, you know, it's a matter of a few months
B:	Right.
A:	and they're going to be right back for the same thing
A:	so the system,
B:	We're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes,
B:	so.
A:	That's very true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day
A:	and I said, you know, I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States, to
A:	and,  and the, and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, we,
A:	and, and
A:	I know people say, oh, it would be cruel to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries
A:	and, and maybe so,
A:	so tell them, you've got five years. To work out a plan, to make it on your own.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, we will continue funding you for the next two years,
A:	after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy you know, seventy-five percent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,
A:	and in five years, it
A:	by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help.
B:	Sure.
A:	And then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to,  to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we're trying to,  heal the world, you know,
B:	Very serious, yeah.
A:	it's just not,  it's just not working.
B:	Oh, yeah ,
B:	your right , .
A:	I look at the, I look at what, you know, what, the aid presented to the Kurds
A:	and I, I feel sorry for them
A:	and I know they're suffering
A:	and I know they're dying everyday,
A:	but we've got, you know, kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too. You know, and being,  abused and neglected
B:	Sure.
B:	Oh .
A:	and, you know, I don't know.
A:	I just have this problem with,  uh, trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself, you know,
B:	You bet .
A:	so.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, we seem to agree on the jury thing
B:	and, uh, but, uh , we'll need an unanimous verdict
B:	and,  maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make, a decision .
A:	Yep.
A:	I think we should try it, like you say,
B:	Yeah.
A:	if it doesn't work, we can always come back,
A:	but I think it would be a good idea to try it.
B:	I do too.
A:	So, anyway, well, we all agree.
B:	Well, good.
B:	Good to hear from you.
A:	You too, bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	So I own a, a P C A T at my home.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,
B:	I mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,
B:	well, who is this,
B:	what do you use yours at home for?
A:	Well, that's actually a good question.
A:	My wife works out of the home, our home.
A:	She has an office
A:	and in fact she sits in the office
A:	and she uses it to compose and print out letters.
B:	Okay,
B:	well now.
A:	So that's a very regular use of it that she has.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in addition to that I tinker around with it.
A:	I'm a computer scientist.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so I write programs to do little things
A:	I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.
A:	And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.
B:	Uh, huh, well, excuse me, I, uh, uh, well I'm a technician, electronics tech.
B:	Years ago T I sent me to their, uh, computer school down in Austin.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, I learned to repair one
B:	but you know I never really learned to operate one.
A:	Oh, that's a key thing.
A:	Well, actually that's a,
A:	there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today. That just require no programming.
B:	Yes.
A:	So that
A:	in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
A:	but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think you you really hit the nail on the head.
A:	For the average person is exactly what he can use it for.
A:	And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
A:	or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,
A:	whatever
A:	there, your issue is then there really,
B:	Well, uh, space is a handicap with me,
B:	I live in a motor home.
A:	Oh, I see
A:	well.
B:	And I'm preparing for retirement.
A:	I see
A:	well, congratulations on that.
B:	And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.
B:	Yes,
B:	definitely,
B:	but just like the computers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, the calculators you mean.
B:	I mean calculators,
B:	I beg your pardon.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they sure do.
A:	Yeah
A:	I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.
A:	You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.
B:	You're kidding.
A:	No.
B:	Including a printer?
A:	Well, actually I wasn't including a printer,
A:	but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
A:	so make it seven hundred.
B:	A hundred?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wholly smoke,
B:	a respectable one?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,
B:	but I'm, I'm, that does amaze me.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the prices had plummeted,
A:	you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,  the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	And then the keyboard is another fifty,
A:	the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred
A:	and then the disk drive is two fifty.
B:	Well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive.
A:	Well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,
A:	you're buying these knock offs,
A:	so there's,
A:	probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's a big magazine,
A:	it's twelve inches narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.
A:	But the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses
A:	and they're all competing with each.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer
A:	that that's called, it's the original P C.
A:	So it's,
A:	we call the T I, I'm sorry an I B M P C compatible.
A:	And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.
B:	Uh.
A:	And you mix and match
A:	and then you do it by mail-order.
A:	But there's no real brands
A:	it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.
B:	I see.
B:	How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?
A:	They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that that type of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.
A:	And like I said it's about an inch thick
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well, getting back to the P C
B:	I'll tell you,
B:	I ya,
B:	first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.
B:	And secondly, I did learn this much about computers,
B:	they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.
B:	In binary.
A:	That's right
A:	There's great.
B:	Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.
A:	Oh, yeah
B:	One and one equals ten.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's great.
B:	Course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.
A:	I understand,
A:	that's great,
A:	that's a good joke.
B:	So what,
B:	do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?
A:	I did for years
A:	and then I was a scientist over in central research labs
A:	and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, now I I type that one,
A:	but I don't use it anymore.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well I just recently started using one.  In connection with my work.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh, I keep track of an inventory here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.
A:	Yes,
A:	I agree.
B:	And, well I, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	See I'm with the Q R A lab. Qualification and evaluation
A:	Oh, I see
A:	that's fascinating.
B:	so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they're dated.
B:	So I have to keep up with them, uh,
B:	and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just run a printout every week
B:	and and it puts me right up-to-date what I'm, what I have to do, what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So a,
B:	it it is handy.
A:	Right.
B:	And I must admit that up until I did start using one, uh, it was, I had very little interest in computers.
A:	Yes
B:	But they are amazing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they certainly are.
A:	So let's see, see
A:	so I guess with respect to the question,
A:	yeah,
A:	I guess we've kind of covered it.
B:	I think we did.
A:	Great,
A:	nice little conversation with you Jack.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Mike you take care now.
A:	Good day.
B:	Good luck to you.
A:	Thank you.
A:	Same to you.
A:	Uh, I guess I've had to return something
A:	but I'm can't decide,
A:	mostly it's been because I didn't like the color,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or, um, I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things, uh,
B:	Well, I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned.
A:	Oh, are you?
B:	So, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.
A:	Okay,
A:	good,
A:	so, we'll talk about that some.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we could talk about that,
B:	and then we could talk a bit about, um, just quality of products in general,  if they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Okay,
A:	I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack,  because you sound like you're,
A:	let me tell you just a little bit about myself.
A:	I, for years I did all that shopping and whatnot,
A:	but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem,
B:	Oh.
A:	and I've had two cornea transplants.
A:	Shopping is no fun anymore
B:	I can imagine.
B:	Well, see I don't,
A:	I can't see good enough, you know,
A:	and, uh, it's hard to tell what I'm doing,
A:	and it's just
B:	You can't read labels
B:	and you can't,
A:	Oh, I just thought of something we have to return
B:	Good.
B:	There you go.
A:	All right.
A:	It, it'll come to us,
A:	okay?
B:	Okay.
A:	Are you ready?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Laurie, all right
B:	Right.
A:	All right, uh,
A:	tell me about your computer, Laurie,
A:	I think that sounds fascinating.
B:	Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project,
B:	and we called up the company and asked them details on it.
B:	We bought it sort of, your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with,
B:	and they were very happy with the system,
B:	and they felt they've gotten a good price.
B:	And we went in,
B:	we explained what we needed
B:	and yes
B:	we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to get, to meet these people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so we went there,
B:	we told them about the stuff
B:	and the guy said, uh, that the computer would fit our needs.
B:	And we
B:	these things won't make any sense to you probably
B:	but he told us there were,  we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	And it's called a user boards
B:	or slots is what it's called.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit, sorry, two four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user,
B:	and we can put full size cards in there.
B:	And so we said, great, you know,
B:	we'll buy it,
B:	and we put in our order.
B:	And a week later we went back and picked up the computer.
B:	And then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it
B:	and there's only one slot we could put it in.
A:	Oh, lovely.
B:	And at this point we only have one board
B:	so it wasn't so bad
B:	so we used it a bit,
B:	but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in.
A:	Huh.
B:	And,
A:	Oh, no ,
A:	the computer was supposed to have two.
B:	Well, it has them
B:	but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it, in it. And even though they told us in advance that you could,
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	they told us there would be no problem because, you know,  the salesman just doesn't really know.
A:	I see.
A:	In some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it.
A:	They probably didn't know what they were talking about.
B:	Right.
B:	That's completely it.
B:	The salesman didn't know.
A:	Right.
B:	So, we went back in,
B:	and we struck an agreement with the people
B:	who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards.
A:	Huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	So they did that.
B:	And we said are you sure this will work,
B:	we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,
B:	and they're, they were doing it at their own costs.
B:	And so we said, fine.
B:	And we went back
B:	and we talked to the person a second time and things like that,
B:	and then we come, we get the computer home,
B:	my husband goes to pick it up last week
B:	and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby,
B:	and  you know, life's just a little bit complicated.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh .
B:	And, uh, he goes and gets it, brings it home,
B:	first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out.
B:	And then second thing, we still can't put the boards in,  because they have other things blocking where we need to do it.
A:	Oh, jeez .
A:	Huh.
B:	And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again
B:	and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors
B:	and we hope so,
B:	but it's a hassle.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it really is.
B:	You you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on.
A:	Right,
A:	and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.
B:	Right.
A:	I think that's the worst part.
A:	I,
B:	So, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card
B:	and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,
B:	and they said, well, you don't have to pay for it yet.
A:	Now that's an advantage, isn't it?
B:	Yes.
A:	It really is.
A:	I think, uh, uh, there's a lot not to be said for credit
A:	but that's one thing to be said for credit.
A:	It, how ,  it gets you some muscle where you need it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	So, and so, you know,
A:	And I think that's really important.
B:	Well, because these guys if they, um, give us a hard time we're going to say, you, look, you know,
B:	if, if you can't fix this to our satisfaction,  we're just returning the computer.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	And if we do that,
B:	I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge,  even though they've already paid it.
A:	That's right.
A:	No .
B:	But they'll just, you know,  undo the credit that they did to them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they will,
A:	That's right.
A:	They will,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And,
A:	We,
A:	Hal bought me, uh, uh, small, uh, well, uh, uh, little jam box kind of thing
A:	so I'd,
A:	my, I have my ninety-three year old mother living with us,
A:	and so I, she doesn't remember anything
A:	but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought well, if I had, uh, a a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. And then also so that I can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, I, I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace so I figured well this will be good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, the first, uh, uh, the first time I turned it on, uh, I was recording,
A:	and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the,  thing.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Okay,
A:	so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then on the other side, when I, when I, uh, I loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to, uh, to, uh, videotaping they were doing,
A:	and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far,
A:	and so you can't, you can't get it to run the right, the right way,  either,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, uh,
B:	What brand is it?
B:	Do you know?
A:	Yeah,
A:	so I, I wish I could tell you
A:	I really don't know which brand it is.
A:	It's ,
B:	But I was wondering like, you know
B:	in our case where we knew we were buying a copy
B:	we weren't buying,  on I B M P C
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I was wondering if you,
A:	No,
A:	I think this is a, I think this is maybe a name brand
A:	and I suspect that it's probably just a fluke, you know.
A:	I have the papers and everything
A:	and we're going to get, just take it back
A:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you buy it at some major store?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think just, uh, just, uh, one of the major, I think it was a, you know, I don't, I think it was, uh, you know, like a Highlands or something like this.
B:	Highlands
B:	chain down there that I don't know up here.
A:	Do they have Highlands up there?
B:	Nope.
A:	Don't they?
A:	Well, this is, is was a regular, uh, electronics store, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I don't think, I don't think there will be too much problem
A:	but I, I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well.
A:	I think they deliberately sometimes, um,
B:	I think a lot of things are not made as well.
A:	Don't you?
A:	What, what, for instance, what are you,
B:	Um, oh,
B:	of course, it's hard to think of an exact example,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I think that, um,  I
A:	That's good
A:	they're getting a kind of a, attitude of,  not,
B:	yeah,
B:	I just have , well, I like electronic stuff,  you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	for one thing. I know their, work, you know,
B:	cars I think are not made,  as well as they could be.
A:	Well,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Um,
A:	I think that's right.
A:	The fact that,
B:	because I ,
B:	they want people to replace it after,  a couple of years.
A:	Right.
A:	The fact that they, that they have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes, uh, dwells on a fact that, you know, uh,
A:	I've had, I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, they may cost a little more,
A:	but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I had a Toyota
B:	and I loved it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My Toyota did,  really well.
A:	It does the,  it did a good job,
A:	so, part of it is that we need to develop more of a, of a pride in, in, uh, the kinds of things we do so we make them better.
B:	Good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it kind of has to start from the top and, and go or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.
A:	People,
B:	Well, I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.
B:	The people just don't care about,  what they're doing.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, the whole,
B:	nobody cares, no, nobody's,  really paying,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Attitude is, is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do, and, on,
B:	Right,
B:	give me my paycheck, so I can go home.
A:	what I'm doing, right.
A:	I think that's too bad.
A:	And it's a shame too because, uh, when you get right down to it most things, there isn't any, if you do a good job, nobody can pay you enough
A:	There isn't,  any way to get paid enough.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But if you do a good job, you feel enough satisfaction,
A:	so whatever you're paid is enough.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and also I think,
B:	well, I do research
B:	and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, and you get satisfaction out of it.
A:	That's right,
B:	And,  But I think a lot of it, you know, I think things come both from the, uh, individual side and also from the company side
A:	I think they underestimate how much, how much value the satisfaction
B:	because the companies that, let, give the attitude that, well, you know,
B:	you're the last one hired
B:	so you'll be the first one fired,
B:	and we just want you to do your day's work,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we don't really care about you,  as an individual.
A:	Yeah.
B:	When you've got that type of attitude on it, the people don't care,  about their work.
A:	No .
B:	And so,
A:	It it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately.
A:	Starts with the one person that, you know,
A:	and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay, you know.
B:	Little value just in whatever you do.
A:	Yeah.
A:	The, the, the that the value is in doing it well
B:	Doing a good job of it.
A:	and,
A:	Okay,
A:	Jay, where do you live in Texas?
B:	I live in Dallas,
A:	In Dallas.
B:	uh, right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state. And a, uh, it goes east and west, and a north south tollway.
A:	What's that, the I Thirty and Central express?
B:	It's,
B:	no,
B:	it's called Six Thirty-Five's the highway.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's the looper that goes around the city
A:	Right.
B:	and then, uh, the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Just moved here about, uh, oh, uh, one, about a month ago after twenty-one years, two miles to the east.
A:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Oh, how about that?
B:	So, it's a very different house from the typical Dallas, uh,  house.
A:	It's a  new home?
B:	It's about eight years old,
A:	About eight years.
B:	it's, uh, it's a duplex type thing. Uh, very modern and, uh, very open and airy light.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's different than the, than the long Texas ramblers.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well we we live in a brick story and a half, uh,
B:	What's your house like?
A:	Cape Cod style, I guess you'd call it.
B:	Oh, great,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, uh, have a big sun room on the back of it.
B:	So it's got a lot of openness and light, also?
A:	No,
B:	Oh, it doesn't?
A:	it doesn't have
B:	Well, that's what my wife really wanted
B:	and so, uh,
A:	With openness and light?
B:	Yeah
B:	that's,
A:	I understand that,
A:	I would love that too
B:	Uh, our, our last house wasn't too bad,
B:	but it was just too traditional,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so, if, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	this is very traditional.
B:	the the next time, uh, probably a year and a half from now, we're going to try to build.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	So make one really, uh, contemporary and, and very modern and very open and very light.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have children at home?
B:	No,
B:	I have three in college.
A:	Three?
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	They, they usually, get back for the, at least two of them for the summer,
B:	so, But,
A:	You still need space, plenty of space
B:	Still need a little bit of space.
B:	We, we have a lot less than we had,  uh, recently.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh
B:	Already cut back.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well,
B:	How big is your place?
A:	It's, uh, oh, about twenty-five thousand, twenty-five hundred square feet,  I guess.
B:	Oh  that's good size.
A:	It's four bedrooms and two baths and that,
B:	Yeah.
B:	We,  we had,
A:	It  has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room, and then the big room on the back. Uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we had four bedrooms, two and a half baths, uh, in the place we just left.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So down, now we're down to, two and two.
A:	Two and two,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home,
B:	but it won't be that long, because we, not for sure, you know, how long they're going to stay or whatever.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	I was just reading an article, uh, that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas, uh, for sale by the Resolution Trust Corporation?
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Repossessed
B:	Yes,
B:	and if you get in the, if, if you can find one in the right area you can really  pick up a steal.
A:	I,  I guess so.
B:	Uh, we, we really didn't go that route and didn't look.
B:	Uh, but, uh, the planning of them
B:	and the, the housing market probably still going to even go lower.
B:	There are many, many houses for sale just by the regular route.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh,
A:	That's discouraging if you own property
B:	Yeah.
B:	And we just decided, uh, uh, sell.
B:	And we got, we got a pretty good price, uh, for, for what we had.
B:	Uh, not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago.
A:	Few years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But that, uh, that was just the timing.
A:	Right.
A:	Well our daughter and son-in-law moved up, back up here. He's from Texas, but course she's from here, uh, about a year and a half ago,  and had their house on the market down there,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they never did sell it.
A:	So they stayed six months,
A:	and she got her job back, and he got a job down there.
B:	Oh.
A:	Because,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're not moving very well.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	For sure.
A:	Nope.
B:	And that's a good, uh, example of it.
A:	They live in Rowlett.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I know where that is.
B:	I've been, we've been here for twenty-five years.
A:	Have you?
B:	I'm from Missouri,
B:	and my wife's from Kansas,
B:	so I I teach at a college here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's, uh, it's sort of home now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	What college are you teaching at?
B:	I'm at, uh, one of the uh, it's called Brookhaven College.
B:	It's one of the community colleges.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's very nice,  very convenient.
A:	The only one I know  is Richardson
B:	Yeah.
B:	Now Richland College is out, it serves Richardson and, uh, Garland.
A:	Garland,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And that's about nine miles to the east of here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, anyway, well, it's good to hear from you.
A:	Well I enjoyed  talking to you.
B:	And I hope we,  hope we did them some good, uh, on their little computer dealy.
A:	I hope so
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, have a good life, the rest of it.
A:	Okay,
A:	thank you,
A:	same to you.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
B:	Have a big family, I guess,
B:	that's a start.
A:	Well I guess so.
A:	Have you had any in the
A:	well how old are you?
B:	Twenty-five,
B:	so,
A:	Okay
A:	so you  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.
B:	I just got married.
B:	Right,
B:	every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.
A:	Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?
B:	Well, we plan on it,
B:	it's like the third weekend in August,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so it's every four years
B:	and so,
A:	So they all know it.
B:	Yeah
B:	and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people are from down here, in Texas.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.
B:	That's where I'm originally from.
A:	Yes.
B:	So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.
A:	Well that sounds like fun,
A:	do they all have the small children too, that come?
B:	Yeah,
B:	pretty much.
A:	So all ages.
B:	Yeah
B:	and, uh, you know, there's some my age
B:	and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.
A:	Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they don't ever plan it as, like you do.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind
A:	so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,  because they're rather socially active too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.
A:	If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else
A:	and we're already locked in
A:	but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.
B:	Oh.
A:	Therefore, they don't have many people left.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh,
A:	I haven't known many of those people,
A:	but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family
A:	and that's been very nice,
A:	with, uh,
A:	I have one sister,  and three brothers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're only three out of five of us who have children.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they don't see each other very often,
A:	we don't really know many of them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's kind of bad.
A:	It really is,
A:	they're fun,
A:	they're a lot of fun,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis
A:	and, uh, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.
B:	A lot of my cousins are real close
B:	and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that,
B:	so.
A:	Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?
B:	Uh, no,
A:	Or you go to Indiana on that?
B:	the ones in Indiana,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	where in Indiana?
B:	Lafayette.
A:	Lafayette, I don't know where,
A:	I used to live in Indianapolis.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's very pretty country in there I think,
A:	it's gorgeous.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	so.
A:	Well I,
A:	uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now.
B:	Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation
B:	the next one was when I graduated from college,
B:	so I guess about two more years.
A:	Yes, well,
A:	and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
B:	Uh, maybe,
B:	I don't know,
A:	Maybe
B:	two more years,
B:	I don't know,
B:	probably.
A:	I mean you need another milestone, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess that's, that's what,
B:	I mean I've been married now for about nine months
B:	so that was another milestone, I guess
A:	Yes,
A:	well I'm sure,
A:	and then all of your family probably has not met your husband.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	he's from Indiana,
A:	Oh, is he?
B:	so they all met,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, and he's living, your both living in Sherman.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you work to T I?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and does he?
B:	No,
B:	he's trying to get in med school,
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, we don't either,
A:	but, uh, I have a friend who, uh, is working on this project.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yes,
A:	and,
B:	Are they getting all the data they need?
A:	Well, I don't know, uh,
A:	I, I have a hard time getting, uh, people on the telephone.
B:	Oh really.
A:	Uh-huh, getting through to anybody.
A:	Sometimes I call off and on all day,
B:	Huh.
A:	but anyway, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we
A:	But I got off that.
B:	Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And, uh, uh, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	But it has been fun talking to you.
B:	Well you too.
A:	Thank you.
B:	And maybe I'll talk to you again.
A:	Okay,
A:	good.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right.
B:	What, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?
A:	I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies
B:	and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.
B:	She didn't start working until I was, um, well into high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids.
A:	Yeah,
A:	true.
A:	Well, mine taught kindergarten
A:	but she was always, uh,
A:	I guess her schedule was shorter
A:	so she was always, uh,  home,
B:	Always home by the time you got home.
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that statistic I guess has been growing every year
A:	it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I'm not sure what the future holds for that
A:	whether,
B:	It seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on
B:	I, I, um, clean houses part-time,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work
A:	Huh.
B:	Um,
A:	That's unusual
B:	they are, they're all, um,
B:	it's, and it's, I think it's kind of a new movement
B:	it's going back towards, you know,
B:	women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years
B:	and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I, I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that
B:	a lot of, a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies
B:	and I think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, I don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where I don't, I don't have children yet,
B:	but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids.
B:	But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is tough.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're looking at that now,
A:	my wife's about six months along.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, it's going to kind of kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.
A:	True.
B:	Um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.
A:	I would think it would be women that were working full-time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home.
A:	Huh.
B:	Um, they're real active in volunteer work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, one of the women is real active with, uh, Muscular Dystrophy. And, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis
B:	but it's still, it's almost like a job,
B:	she just doesn't get paid for it.
A:	Huh. Well, I guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active.
B:	Yeah.
B:	When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home
B:	or is she going to,  go back to work?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're,  we're going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.
A:	What do you think?
B:	That, that, that,
B:	I would, I would like to be able to do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we think it's, uh, that important
A:	and I, I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.
A:	I'm a, a counselor and a therapist,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I work with adolescents,
A:	and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,  uh, were, you know, mom was like, um, Mrs Cleaver, uh, you know, June Cleaver or whatever,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	where the, the attitudes were a lot different.
B:	Um, as far as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more,
B:	um, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,  um, a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think morally, um, it seems like there was, people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards.
A:	True.
A:	Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure
A:	and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	And that's, you know, that's contributed,
B:	And I think, I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.
A:	Yeah,
A:	maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,
A:	so. If there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,
A:	there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,  and those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent
B:	What, how do you, what do you think?
A:	About?
B:	That as far as
B:	do you think there's going to be still a family unit
B:	or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?
A:	The balance
A:	I don't,
A:	the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so
A:	and it got higher than that for a while.
A:	Um, that's hard to say.
A:	Families are such a strange configuration anymore.
A:	Um, I, I see a lot of families where,
A:	you know, in the, in the back,
A:	I grew up about the same time you did,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, nowadays it's not the case,
A:	kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
A:	and one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.
A:	They get bombarded with junk
A:	and they don't have to do anything around the house.
A:	They never learned to be responsible when,
B:	Yeah.
A:	the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while
A:	and they come back,
A:	and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So. It's not, not a real functional situation anyway.
A:	So, you know, I don't know it's, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families
A:	and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.
B:	like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's pretty sad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is,
A:	I guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.
A:	And I, I don't know
A:	we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income
A:	it, it may be tough
A:	but we may have to give up on some, some things.
B:	I, I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so too.
B:	Well, I, I need to go ahead and, and wrap it up.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um, it was really nice talking to you.
A:	Well, I've enjoyed it, Stephanie.
B:	And, uh, thanks a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	have you, did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?
B:	Uh, no
B:	I've only been here for the last ten years, uh,
A:	Oh, where are you from?
B:	I grew up most of my childhood in Germany.
A:	In Germany.
B:	Uh, and,
A:	Well,
B:	we, we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.
A:	Now there's a place I'd like to visit
B:	So we, we travelled all over Europe. When I was, when I was very young. Unfortunately, a, a little bit too young to really appreciate.
A:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I was grade school age. Uh,
A:	My my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe, or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war
A:	and so we've seen lots of pictures of the, of the beautiful,  spots and,  areas,
B:	Um.
B:	That,  that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, uh, I, I sure would work on it  if I had an opportunity like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's neat, neat
A:	What kind of vacations do you like?
B:	Uh, well my husband and I are scuba divers.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, we both like to go to dive resorts.
B:	Uh, we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we dove there.
B:	Uh, but, we, we did about six dives while we were there.
B:	And, uh, we were originally planning on going to Cayman,  uh, last year
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.
B:	We had to have, like, eleven people for,  this package, uh, deal.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go,
B:	so it ended up falling falling through.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We were going to get a really good price.
A:	When, when our children were younger, we enjoyed, we lived up in, uh, New York,  or New Jersey and, and used to like, uh, traveling into upstate New York and camping
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and, that sort of thing,
A:	but we've never really, uh, did any diving or anything.
A:	Little bit of of, uh, uh, oh,  water skiing.
B:	Snorkeling?
B:	Oh, really.
A:	But, not much of, uh,  of anything else.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh,
B:	Well, my husband and I both like water,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so any, any vacation that we go on is usually,  involves, close to the ocean,   or, or something like that.
A:	It's got to be the water.
A:	Right.
A:	When, when we were in Jersey, we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot, and really enjoyed that a lot.
A:	It's really, they had,  a really nice beach areas there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we,  After we moved away from Germany, we moved to New Hampshire.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I lived there for seven years.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Uh,  and I really enjoyed that because, you know, the mountains were real close,
A:	That's a really pretty area, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we like the, we like the white mountains
B:	and, Uh, unfortunately, I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I went skiing once.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we loved the, we loved the, the New Jersey area, too, because the the lakes were really pretty close, you know,
A:	you could,  you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail,
A:	we did quite a bit of hiking,
A:	which is kind of fun.
A:	Are you a, you a hiker, or not?
B:	Uh,
A:	Not so much, huh?
B:	Not, not really so much.
B:	If, if, if there was some place that, that we went to where there was hiking involved, I, I would be you know, happy to go hiking,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh, places to go hiking.
A:	So your, your next, your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Our next vacation will, will be scuba diving,
B:	I'm sure.
A:	You have any children?
B:	No,
B:	not yet.
A:	Okay,
A:	then that's probably one of the reasons our,
A:	we had little children all the time,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, adaptable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation,  when you have, have children.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too,
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and diving is something that,
B:	especially for small children, uh,
B:	I think the, the minimum age for diving is,  is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Eleven or twelve, I would think, probably
A:	but, maybe fifteen even.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.
A:	You know, we go wherever somebody is,  that we haven't seen for a while
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that, that's kind of,
A:	uh, we just came back from, uh, uh, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate,  from, uh, with his Master's Degree in social work
A:	and so that was fun,
A:	and, and the summer we have a, we have a, a reunion in, in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather large reunion group that, uh, as we can get together
A:	so,
B:	That, that sounds like a lot of fun.
B:	Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too,
A:	Yeah.
B:	that there were several hundred, uh, people
B:	and they all kind of met at a central place.
B:	I, I didn't go,
A:	Um.
B:	uh, but it would have been nice. It would have been a nice vacation.
A:	We, we've we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country.
A:	I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe, you know, like a,  a small camper.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We've, we've travelled in a big one.
A:	I hate them because they're hard to jockey around, you know,
A:	but maybe a pickup with the back on,
B:	or something like, uh, what's the, like the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes,
A:	but you wouldn't want to do it all the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, we have enough friends here and there,
A:	I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know, and visit for a day and then go on and, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	My dad has been talking for years about, uh, getting a fifth wheel and just picking up,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he's retired
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, he's in his sixties,
B:	and he, uh, would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there,  and just, you know, not,  be settled anywhere,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think,  I think that would real,
B:	just see, see the rest of the country.
A:	and I would like to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	He, he does that quite a bit.
A:	And,
B:	He, he hasn't lately, though, uh, because he's been ill,
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
B:	and, you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.
B:	I'm going here, here and here
B:	and I'll be back in about two months
A:	Yeah.
A:	There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America,
A:	that's for sure.
A:	We've, I haven't been much to the south,
A:	I haven't been in, in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama.
A:	I guess that's, those are the only states I have not visited.
A:	But, uh, up the coast, uh, at, uh, uh, in Maryland and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some
A:	Johnstown and, uh, in in that area is just really neat,
A:	interesting things to
A:	so, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so,
B:	Have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I believe it was.
A:	Uh, had about three kids then I think,
A:	but that was a really fun, interesting trip.
A:	I we, we read Bruce book before we went, you know,
A:	and, so we were ready to look up the places we read about.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I I think right, right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and,  and adventurous types of things,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then when eventually, when we have kids,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.
B:	You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that.
A:	Well, now, camping is fun with kids.
A:	If you're,  you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones,
A:	but, even, even some little ones do pretty good
A:	but,  but when they get a little bigger so they can help,
B:	Yeah.
A:	that, that's a fun way to to, uh, cut costs
A:	and it's enjoyable, too.
A:	Very restful.
A:	I mean I find,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I do enjoy camping.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of a change.
B:	As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine And electricity.
A:	Yeah
A:	Well, I'm with you.
A:	I need my creature comforts, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it was great to talk to you.
B:	It was nice talking to you, too, Beth.
A:	Okay,
A:	see you later.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	What kind of painting are you planning to do?
B:	Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, it's a rent house
B:	and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper
B:	so I decided I'm going to paint.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint.
B:	And I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them. Either that or maybe rag rolling. To give it kind of a country look.
A:	Oh, what would be interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments,
A:	but they look very interesting
A:	and you get some beautiful effects with them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, one of the books that I bought, where it's describing the sponge painting, said you can like layer different colors
B:	and,
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah,
A:	I've seen that done, where there's uh, oh,
A:	I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat
A:	and then it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in between there was a sort of a rust, uh, put on very sparingly.
B:	Ugh.
A:	And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, what I, what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I want something that's going to tie that together
B:	and I'm changing the, like the towel racks and stuff, the, the fixtures out to make them wood,
B:	I'm going to put wood in there.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that should be nice.
B:	So it's going to have kind of a country look.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and I haven't even decided as far as, um, what kind of paint to buy.
B:	I don't have an actual instruction book
B:	so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now.
A:	Well, uh.
B:	Um, it's going to be a big experiment.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because you might find that it's beyond, uh, what you're willing to put into it. Although I think it could turn out really nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've,
A:	I haven't ever done fancy painting
A:	but I sure did my share of just regular painting.
A:	Uh, I've painted several houses, inside.
A:	I, never painted the outside.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	inside.
B:	What, what kind of, what kind of paint do you normally use?
A:	Well, uh, we used a latex, uh, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork
A:	and my job was mostly the woodwork.
B:	Okay,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers
A:	and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, uh, trim work, where I'd use a small brush and, uh, try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well we only have only one of our bathroom has a window in it
B:	so I'm hoping that, um, it won't be too much of a, a problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first. Because I, I think,
A:	Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it.
B:	No,
B:	I'm, I'm planning on taking it off.
A:	I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now, which make it much easier to get wallpaper off.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, oh, with a just a scraper and wet sponge
A:	and it took forever.
A:	I would not recommend that method.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, if if you can rent a steamer, if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble.
B:	Well that's something that, that's worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I,
A:	If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with.
B:	It, it's hard to tell,
B:	it's,
B:	the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I know the house, um, was built around the mid fifties.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it may be the original wallpaper
A:	Could be,
A:	yeah.
A:	Um, if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too.
A:	If it's paper it will probably shred.
B:	Um, in one bathroom it's, um, it's probably paper, uh,
B:	it's silver, silver and yellow, and white.
A:	Um, uh-huh
A:	Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black,
A:	this was in a bathroom too.
A:	And the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white
A:	and the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background
A:	and then it had vivid, uh, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, uh, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
B:	Um, that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.
A:	Oh it was awful,
A:	it was absolutely hideous
A:	and, and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it
A:	and a, a guest went in there
A:	and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations
B:	Really.
B:	Well I, I've also been thinking about, after looking at all these magazines, um, these design magazines and stuff, I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that will kind of, um, tie in our, um, our, um, our, uh, comforter, with a color that's kind of a, um, burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and I'm not really quite sure,
B:	I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew.
A:	Well I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes
A:	and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.
A:	Sure.
B:	It wouldn't be any kind of special, um, special effects type thing.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It would be just plain paint.
A:	Well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time.
A:	Because if you, uh, use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out, uh, all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto, you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it
A:	and it can be done a whole lot faster. And with rollers and, uh, modern latex paints,
B:	Um, okay.
A:	you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they dry fast
A:	so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. If you have some help.
B:	Um.
A:	And then if that, if you discover the little tricks and tips about, you know, how you get through corners and how you do trim and, uh, how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it, when you pull it up.
B:	It, it peels the paint off when you take it off,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, not,
A:	if you leave it on for weeks, it will do that.
A:	If you take it up the next day it should be fine.
A:	You want it to get dry, but not, uh, just real hard.
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard.
A:	That's the problem.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long.
A:	And I've, I was told,
A:	I always used the nice wide masking tape,
A:	but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth. Because it, it rips as you pull it off for one thing
B:	Oh really,
B:	okay.
A:	and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
B:	Um.
A:	And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work.
A:	You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.
A:	But use, use good, uh, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands, that will go down and come up easily.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips,
B:	I think you are, just made my project a lot easier
A:	Well I wish you very good luck with it
A:	and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business.
A:	The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets
A:	and I decided that was too much to tackle,
A:	I'd hire a professional.
B:	If you were, if you were closer I'd, I'd, I'd tell you you could come over and supervise
A:	Well if I were closer I might.
A:	Oh, well I hope your project turns out great
A:	and I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting.
A:	I think that could give it a really a,
B:	Well, we'll see how it goes,
B:	I may just be flat painting over it.
A:	Well, of course that's the other advantage of paint.
A:	If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I need to go to the dentist,
B:	so.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	It's was nice talking to you Kathleen.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	I think I get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio,
B:	and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention.
A:	Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion.
A:	I, I, I'm from New York originally
A:	and now that I live in Florida,
A:	I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES.
A:	I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger,
A:	and I try
A:	now that it has a national edition, I read that.
A:	I also read, uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and I guess I'm ,
B:	I like them
B:	but they take so long.
B:	I don't always have time
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, there
A:	, it's a whole hour show.
A:	Actually, it's an hour show each evening,
A:	and, and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner.
A:	We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I find that I'm leaning on, uh,
A:	I travel a great deal, uh, even overseas,
A:	and I find that I lean on, uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff.
A:	And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out.
A:	I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say,
A:	but it's, it's coverage, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think C N N does a pretty good job.
B:	I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they seemed to have the best coverage.
B:	They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks.
A:	Uh.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I, I, I, uh,
A:	Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, uh, Iraq.
A:	I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw
B:	Yeah.
A:	and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know.
B:	Well, uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted,
B:	but I think they said that frequently enough.   That, uh, you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective.
A:	Yeah
A:	, oh, yeah,
A:	I mean, uh.
A:	No.
B:	Uh,
A:	That, that's right, I think so.
A:	And, and I guess when it comes to, um, to magazines, I don't read,
A:	I used to when I was younger,
A:	I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.
A:	I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper
A:	or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	which sort of gives you a different slant, than,
A:	it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, that I guess, and the radio.
A:	Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot
A:	and I also listen to, uh, these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving.
A:	I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Do you read,
A:	are you from Southern or Northern California?
B:	Northern.
B:	I'm from, uh, the peninsula,
A:	So well,
A:	Yeah,
A:	is that, what is that,
B:	Palo Alto.
A:	the San Francisco paper out there is, uh,  the major paper?
B:	Well,
B:	it's horrible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and that's a terrible paper.
B:	The San Francisco paper is just wretched.
B:	So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS.
A:	Is that pretty good?
B:	Palo Alto is about midway between.
B:	Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper
B:	and,
A:	Oh the, what is that, the CHRONICLE isn't it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER,
A:	Oh.
B:	but they're, uh, both run by the same
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	they they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read.
A:	I, uh, uh,
B:	They're just horrid
A:	Yeah.
B:	so we read,
A:	Well, can you get the L A paper up there?
A:	That's a pretty decent paper isn't it
A:	or,
B:	Uh, we can,
B:	but I don't like it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and uh, MERCURY NEWS.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well that's another one I read,
A:	I forgot that.
A:	I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL,
A:	not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
A:	but,
B:	Yes,
B:	well again, I read that, uh, two columns on the front.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think I, I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff.
A:	I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I spend a lot of time reading about these things.
A:	I'm quite interested.
A:	I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today.
B:	Yes
B:	and I think we do get pretty good coverage.
B:	I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, uh, the news coverage.
A:	If anything, they, I think they
B:	We almost have too much.
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and and taking their word for it, or their comment,
A:	actually, they, I think they slant things
A:	but,
B:	Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.
B:	I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston.
A:	No kidding!
A:	Oh, wow!
B:	And I hated him then.
A:	I didn't know that.
A:	Yeah?
B:	And I would not watch that man for money.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach.
A:	Yeah,
A:	was, was he,
B:	So I watch Peter Jennings, and, uh and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How do you feel about it?
A:	I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to,
A:	I don't know
A:	if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.
B:	Do we get enough news or something like that?
A:	Yeah.
A:	To,
B:	Do we get, uh do we get the news that we want?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I do.
B:	I really think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think I do too.
A:	I think you have to let, you got to segregate some of it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's about all I have to say
B:	Okay,
B:	well nice to talk to you.
A:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, we, uh,
A:	taxes,
A:	everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure.
A:	But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases.
A:	What do you think?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I, I think so.
B:	I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something
B:	and I don't know what to cutback on to,  to get, to get that, to get that settled.
A:	At this stage it's hard, to tell.
B:	And, and, uh, and, uh, I know I'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes
B:	so I'm I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas
B:	and, and,
A:	Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because,  like the, the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know
A:	I live in Richardson
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals
A:	and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I,
B:	we'd, when we moved to Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that,  because we supported the,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,
A:	and the public,  colleges also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	one of the,
A:	uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition.
A:	Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount,
A:	but I eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.
B:	I, I don't, I don't know about that,
B:	I, I,
A:	Yeah
A:	Well, I quit ten years ago
A:	so I,  I couldn't afford to start again
B:	I see.
B:	Okay.
B:	No, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that, that, that would be true.
B:	That would be true.
B:	But,
A:	I know, uh,
A:	my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.
B:	Huh.
A:	But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know.
A:	Well, this, this is a thing
A:	I think it's like, uh, back east.
A:	You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities.
A:	You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.
A:	If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that,  and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But now,  digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive.
B:	And,
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I think a lot of people were, uh, leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties
B:	and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You know, the, the little joke about, will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light
A:	Oh, well, it's a nice place, you know,
A:	I mean it's, it's a nice, that's a nice place, though.
B:	Well, you know, I, I said I lived in, uh, the Pontiac.
B:	I didn't live in the city of Pontiac,
B:	I lived to the west of it.
B:	Uh, I forget the, the county,
B:	but you know where all the lakes are around there.
A:	Okay,
A:	sort of.
B:	I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.
B:	It was real close to where I worked.
B:	It was only like four miles to work
B:	and it was wonderful being on the lake like that.
B:	You know, in the summer, you feel like you're, you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake
B:	and everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such,
B:	and, uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over,
B:	you could still kind of go sledding and such out there
B:	but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes.
B:	There's lots of really small ones out there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, like maybe a mile, two long.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's enough to, uh, do some boating
A:	That's right.
B:	and it was lots of fun.
A:	That's right. Which is,
B:	Um.
A:	well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor,
A:	so it's probably out in that direction,
A:	but that's the only one I probably could name after all these years
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, But, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes
B:	and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake,
B:	but I just thought that was grand.
B:	And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,
B:	but there was quite a few lakes all around there.
B:	It seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island
B:	there was so much water around where I was.
B:	I said I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac,
B:	I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits
B:	and it was really nice out there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We had, uh, Pine Knob you know, to go skiing and stuff.
A:	Oh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So there were things around there.
B:	Really was pretty nice.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure,
A:	and isn't that where they have a summer music festival there, too?
B:	Right,
B:	right
B:	in the summertime they have musicals there
B:	and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
A:	I know, we used to,
A:	we, we didn't do a lot of it,
A:	but we did. We did,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	so those are always fun.
A:	And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to, It was nice.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I always tell people that in the winter we use, we used to, uh,
A:	my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it,
A:	but then it chipped, chipped
A:	and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	We used to have a
B:	Christmas time, uh, some of our relatives would come up from Alabama,
B:	and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas
B:	and the kids when they were young would just go nuts.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, because they were from Alabama where it never snowed
A:	Oh.
B:	and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it, you know, eternally.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, right,
A:	right.
A:	If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time.
B:	My first winter here,
B:	I, I came down in, uh, early eighty-two
B:	and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December couple days before Christmas.
B:	It lasted only a few hours,
B:	like by noon it was gone.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go to work because the roads are all, you know, snow
B:	And I was laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke,
B:	ha ha.
B:	They said, no really, there's snow
B:	and there was, but a very short time
B:	and the weather got warm so quick
A:	Yeah.
B:	it just melted it all away.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun.
A:	No,
A:	that's not fun either,
A:	so, uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets
A:	so, But, uh, well we have,
A:	our house is kind of on a little hill,
A:	so, uh, we get the sled out
A:	and, uh, the kids go down the the hill on the sleds when it's icy,
A:	I mean they just go down the ice.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.
A:	I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I think it's fun,
B:	even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit.
B:	I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad,
B:	but if you get on the, the, uh, grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, you know, not slip and fall.
B:	I mean, first,
A:	I really haven't seen any movies lately,
A:	so when the computer picked this one, I was a little bit surprised,
A:	but, I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about, oh, six months,
A:	but, uh, you know, the last movies that I've seen were probably on video.
B:	Oh, well that's,
B:	we rent a lot of videos too.
A:	Yeah
B:	Uh, we saw,
B:	I have two little babies
B:	and we saw one movie recently
B:	and that was THE TERMINATOR movie, uh, which I didn't like after all .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie,
A:	but, and that's kind of blood and guts, isn't it.
A:	I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff.
B:	Well, I don't either.
B:	It,
B:	on all the, the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie.
B:	He doesn't.
B:	He maims them
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah,
A:	he maims them pretty good, doesn't he?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	He, he, uh, I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part. In the movie.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	I, I saw, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
A:	Uh, Uh, I saw it, uh,
B:	Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.
A:	oh, couple weeks ago I rented it and, uh, watched it
A:	and I was, I was pretty disappointed in it
A:	because I, I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was pretty disappointed in it.
B:	Oh.
A:	Now it's a good movie,
A:	but, I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, With all the commercials and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I haven't,
B:	that's one we want to see.
B:	I, I want to see, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, we haven't seen that one yet, either.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now I haven't seen it either,
A:	but, uh, I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie, but it's long, like three hours.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what I heard, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it We saw, uh, the, the, uh, movie with, uh, Sylvester Stallone, OSCAR.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
A:	OSCAR.
B:	Supposed to be his, uh, his debut in comedy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which was an interesting movie, but not very funny.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know my daughter saw that
A:	and she liked it
A:	so,
B:	Did she?
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, it was, it was an amusing movie.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It
B:	I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, uh, just at the house watching it with, with no one else around.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	And, of course, I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, TOO
A:	and, because I have a ten year old
A:	so, We, we watch a lot of movies around that category, you know that she, that she can watch
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	My son just turned two
B:	and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID, too.
B:	LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are, are his two favorites that we've got
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there's some, I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video, uh, SHIPWRECKED.
B:	Oh, I haven't, I didn't hear that was coming out.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's fixing to come out on video
A:	and, boy, I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out.
B:	Well, they just had uh, THE RESCUERS movie
A:	But,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that was a Disney movie, wasn't it.
B:	I think I heard that was just one, was just out.
B:	He's, uh, he doesn't sit still for the whole movie, yet,
B:	but he likes to, uh, to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the in the movie.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater
B:	Well, I tell you, ever
B:	my, my kids are just small babies
B:	and, I tell you, we really want to go a lot
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, there's so much out on video now, that it's almost, you know,
B:	the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it. Sometimes.
A:	Uh-huh. And then they go to the dollar movies.
B:	So.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	That seems to happen.
B:	I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the, uh, Granada Theater.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, someone said that was a lot of fun to go do.
B:	You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie.
B:	I thought that might be kind of fun to do.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that does sound fun.
B:	And, of course, you need a baby-sitter for that
B:	Definitely.
B:	But, uh, no,
B:	I'd really like to get out to the movies more often.
B:	Course, it's so expensive, now, too that you can't hardly afford it.
A:	Right.
B:	I, I know we get discount tickets where my husband works,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, other than that it just seems like it's so expensive.
B:	And then the popcorn and everything else,
B:	you almost can't afford to do it. No matter what.
A:	That's right.
B:	Although we did actually get,
B:	we went on vacation couple months ago,
B:	and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was fun.
A:	Golly,
A:	I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.
B:	Oh, he's a, Richard Dreyfuss is a, uh, psychiatrist
B:	and Bob is his patient
B:	and Bob follows him on vacation.
B:	It's, uh,
A:	Oh, that's the, that's the one where they burn down the house or something
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh
A:	the house explodes?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's the one.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah.
A:	Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is, uh, oh,
A:	I just forgot the title of it.
A:	Uh Oh, it's supposed to be a real scary one
A:	Uh, darn,
A:	well, here, here's another one that I've seen.
A:	I saw, uh,
A:	I can't remember the title of it, either
B:	Must have left an impression.
A:	How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?
B:	Well, I don't feel very good about it,
B:	but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do.
B:	We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He actually died a few months after that,
B:	and so as,
B:	at least in retrospect, it was the right thing to do
B:	because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days.
A:	Right.
A:	And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?
B:	Um, well, the, see, uh, well,
B:	we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
A:	Oh, my.
B:	right,
B:	we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into.
B:	Or but naturally,
B:	no,
B:	it was even Mennonite related,
B:	I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home.
B:	Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so the convenience,
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, what do you think?
A:	My grandmother lived with us, um, until August, um,
A:	and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home.
A:	She has leukemia
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away
B:	Yeah.
A:	so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home,
A:	and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility.
A:	She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set
B:	Yeah
A:	so.
B:	yeah,
B:	that's important I would say.
A:	Yes.
A:	And that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two,
A:	so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
B:	Okay.
A:	so she didn't have to be transported back and forth.
A:	So, she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well.
A:	It's not her favorite place to be in.
A:	She'd much rather be here with me.
A:	But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I've got little children here who needed me here
A:	she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.
B:	Right,
B:	and that becomes difficult then.
A:	So.
A:	She was falling down and hemorrhaging
A:	and, you know, all kinds of physical problems,
A:	so it just became too much for me to handle,
A:	even though I would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep,
B:	we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life,
B:	but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,
A:	Oh.
B:	and this,
B:	eventually things just went too far
A:	Yeah.
B:	and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age, other people have to kind of help them make decisions.
A:	It sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home,
A:	but she's accepted it real well now
B:	Right
A:	so.
B:	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.
A:	Well, we enjoyed having her here,
B:	And.
A:	but we feel she's much safer where she is now.
A:	She still continues to fall,
A:	but when she does there, a nurse is right there to help her
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I know she's eating the right things,
A:	and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her,
A:	so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
B:	Yep.
A:	so, I think she'll adjust,
A:	Okay,
A:	while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of a couple of menus,
A:	so I decided it had to be in it, informal or not.
A:	You know because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. *sv
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.
A:	I'm not I'm not into formal dinner parties,
A:	but I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.
B:	I see.
B:	So what do you use for cookbooks?
A:	Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married,
A:	but, it's kind of the bible of cooking for me.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful You know, budget cookbooks,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did,
A:	of course I've added several different recipes,
B:	Right.
A:	but, what you serve or what would you
B:	Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds, uh,
B:	so the,
A:	Well, that's good
B:	I, I, I,
B:	so, it you know,
B:	have different perspectives that you are.
B:	I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to, to fall back on,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because it has almost everything in it.
B:	But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh,
B:	it's a good reference when you need to dig something up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK,
B:	I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs
A:	Huh.
B:	uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, you know, the whole meal
A:	Yeah
B:	and so she's
A:	that would be wonderful in these times
B:	yeah,
B:	now, now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes.
A:	Yeah, Uh-huh.
B:	But they're, but they're, but they're interesting they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	What's one of your favorites?
B:	Um, gee,
B:	the one I had most recently was, was one that, was,
B:	she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something,
B:	and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow,
A:	sounds too good.
B:	Uh, and that, and that was, you know, that's, that, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But there are a whole lot of, you know,
B:	I mean, I, I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.
B:	THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.
A:	That sounds fun.
A:	I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I have young children,
A:	and our budget's set, you know, at this time,
A:	but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	That's why sometimes I shy away from, uh, more of a traditional cookbook
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, well, it was interesting talking to you.
A:	It's a fun subject.
A:	Food is one of my favorite things too.
B:	Yes.
A:	Anything else you wanted to add?
B:	Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know,
B:	what would I put together for a formal dinner.
B:	We, we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	and, and, um, put, here, here
B:	the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, um,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, having marinated it first
B:	and, my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,
B:	there's a little bit of brown sugar in there,
B:	and it bakes up
B:	and it's a delicious thing,
B:	and it's easy
A:	That sounds good.
B:	comparatively. Um. I'm sorry,
A:	That sounds really good.
B:	I just love
A:	It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am,
A:	I'm pretty simple right now,
A:	but.
B:	Well, maybe a little more leisure time to do it.
A:	Yes
B:	I don't know,
A:	that's probably, that's true,
A:	I have little ones
A:	and we, and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods right now.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, there again, sometimes it was easy,
B:	they'd, you know,
B:	canned ravioli was, one of their favorites, and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so
B:	Yes.
A:	and it goes a long ways too. All righty.
B:	Well, nice talking to you Cheryl.
B:	Okay.
A:	Talk to you later maybe.
B:	Bye.
A:	Do you have children?
B:	Uh, yes.
B:	Uh, we have two sons.
B:	Uh, one's a freshman in college
B:	and one's a sophomore in high school.
A:	Oh.
B:	And you?
A:	I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter. And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school.
B:	Okay.
A:	And I spend most of my time carpooling
B:	Oh
A:	The story of my life
B:	Yes
B:	Yes. Yeah.
A:	My kids are involved in sports.
A:	My daughter has played basketball for six years,
A:	and my son plays football.
A:	I,
A:	my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
B:	Uh, well, uh, yeah.
B:	We 've spend a spend a did spend a lot of time, uh,
B:	it really helped when the, uh, older one was old enough to get his license and could, uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems.
A:	Yes.
A:	I know,
A:	I know.
A:	The insurance.
B:	But, uh, I, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	for one thing.
B:	Uh, but yeah,
B:	we, uh, we do
B:	but our two had, had, uh, totally different interests of,
B:	but there was not much, uh, overlap as such.
B:	The, the older one is not, was not at all into, uh, sports for the most part.
B:	Uh, he participated
B:	band and, and, uh, scouts were his two big things.
A:	Yes.
A:	My son, is in both band and scouts too.
B:	And, uh and the, yeah, younger one is, uh, uh, the sports one
B:	and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite
A:	Oh, gee.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, yeah,
B:	we spend a lot of time, uh, uh, carpooling and, uh, you know, and then trying to be, uh, up as much as possible with anything that they, that they do.
A:	Right.
B:	But then, uh, we also didn't do , spend, uh, time with them trying to, trying to,
B:	uh, you know, just family time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we had a,
B:	at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth.
B:	And, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, I would have liked to.
B:	I would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some T V watching.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What about you?
A:	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg .
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've, I've heard of that.
A:	Have you?
B:	I've never actually, never actually played it.
B:	But,
A:	Well, it's really fun.
A:	Um, one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis
A:	and a lot of them played it,
A:	and she started a group going in the neighborhood
A:	and my kids wanted to learn how to play it
A:	and it's more fun with four people.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play,
A:	and they both enjoy it.
A:	So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, we play that a lot of them,
A:	and, uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We have family that lives outside of the state
A:	so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so do we.
A:	So, that,
A:	and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping.
A:	So that just kind of works out real well.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, I'm a writer by profession
A:	and my daughter enjoys writing too,
A:	so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
B:	Oh, now that's neat.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	we've never had anything like that.
A:	So that gives us special time together too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that
A:	so I can help her with that
A:	and she gives me ideas for my writing too
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yep.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, well, good.
B:	Well, I, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, you know,
B:	obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, I grew up on a farm, uh, in Iowa,
B:	and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time.
B:	And then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me
B:	and I, I helped out with it.
B:	But, uh, although I have brought my boys into to see where I work, it's not that easy,
B:	and it's, it's certainly not at all common,
B:	and they, they just don't really have that same idea,
A:	Right.
B:	so they, uh,
B:	it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
A:	My husband has taken us to work with him,
A:	and we still don't know what he does.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, we just say he travels a lot.
A:	So, that kind of covers it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, uh, don't travel too much .
A:	He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So those are the real killers.
A:	If he's just gone,
B:	Yes.
A:	he's gone three weeks right now
A:	and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so we just, you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done.
A:	And something major, always needs to be done.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So you just have to, to handle it until he gets home
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
A:	And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
B:	Well, let's see.
A:	So what,  So what gets you?
B:	As far as I'm ,
B:	Well, the thing I think that annoys me the most is, I have, I have young children, a baby in the house
B:	and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep, someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that, that is probably the most aggravating
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know, it invades my time.
B:	I'm the one that pays for the phone.
B:	Uh, if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative and, and go find it, you know.
B:	And that just really does aggravate me.
B:	Uh, what do you think?
A:	Well, I mean I,
A:	that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said.
A:	Although in my case it's my wife and I both work,
A:	we come home
A:	and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings
A:	and it's one solicitation call after another
A:	and, you know.
B:	Your time is, is  valuable,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's  like you say, very annoying
B:	and,
A:	and, uh, why, why do we let this happen.
B:	Oh, I,
B:	that's, that's interesting.
B:	I
B:	the, the market seems to just be growing, too.
B:	I, I guess enough people are not speaking out.
B:	I'm not speaking out, that's for sure.
B:	I just get aggravated about it.
B:	And,
A:	Would, would you,
A:	I mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate?
B:	I really don't know.
B:	I'm, I'm not into uh, heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas,
B:	but I I don't know.
B:	I just, I do particularly find it annoying.
B:	Uh, I'm really not sure. to be,
A:	Yeah.
A:	It, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that. *sv
B:	Well, that, yeah, that might,
A:	And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare the, their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called.
B:	Identify themselves, yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that would be a good an interesting way,
A:	Uh,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, that, that way, those who want it can have it
A:	and those who don't want it, don't have to have it.
B:	Right.
A:	Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself.
B:	Right,
B:	you're,
A:	Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers. Uh, automatically
B:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	and,
B:	And they just get everybody.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	Well, I, I do wish that it would stop on my end because it, it seems to happen at the worst possible moments.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I, I guess the next one is, is door-to-door solicitors.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school.
B:	I have kids
B:	and, you know, that's just kind of part of it
A:	Yeah
B:	but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	and, it's annoying as well.
A:	And these, and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob.
B:	Right,
B:	you just, you really don't know,
B:	so I, I find myself being a a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I do feel like it's a, an invasion of my space.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
B:	I've never quite understood the purpose of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, uh,
A:	Well, I think these people were hired by, from, from different sources.
B:	Just
A:	Uh, with, you know,
A:	and so, therefore, there's no one answer.
A:	But, but, yeah
A:	sometimes it's a market basically it's a market survey
B:	Just a survey.
A:	but they never say who, who they're really working for or what you know, what what, what questions are, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	There have been a couple of times when the, the, uh, whatever the subject was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it
B:	and then there have been several times when I just said, well, I just really don't have the time, you know to deal with it at that moment.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I don't get too many of those.
A:	Yeah
B:	I've had just a few.
A:	Yeah
B:	Uh, generally someone's trying to sell me something
B:	or,
A:	Right,
A:	well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Other times it's, you know, wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose.
B:	Right.
A:	For which, if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's right.
A:	But, but a dollar isn't it,
A:	you know, it's,
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, and I also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway personal information.
A:	Uh, when, when the call comes and, and they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know,
A:	somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things,
A:	and so I start answering
A:	and then you, you know, you go down a path
B:	Right.
A:	uh, and you don't know where it's going to end. In fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality of what you've revealed *sv This isn't, you know, most likely not to, going to be used against you,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, we,
B:	That's true.
A:	but it could
A:	and, And that seems to be something that should, should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse
B:	Yeah,
B:	you just never know, I guess.
B:	That,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I,
A:	and it,
B:	Asking for information is, is,
B:	I can't really see that,
B:	I think they ought to, if, if nothing else, they ought to spend money for a postage stamp
B:	and, you know, when it arrives at your house, oh, I,
A:	Okay,
A:	what kind of house do you live in?
B:	Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas
B:	and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back
B:	and, It's about thirty-five hundred square feet.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.
A:	I live in one,
A:	I don't have a swimming pool.
A:	And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But the four bedrooms
A:	and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike.
A:	I think it's pretty much typical for this area.
B:	It is.
B:	Have you been living there very long?
A:	I've been in the house
A:	I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
B:	So you've been there longer.
B:	We built this one about, uh,
B:	it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we subcontracted it out ourselves.
B:	We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then we subbed it out,
B:	so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I bet you,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My husband got his big garage.
B:	He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
B:	and, so he has all the work space he needs.
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
A:	I bet he's enjoyed having it that way
B:	He,
A:	because
A:	kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.
B:	It is,
B:	and that's why we decided to build.
B:	We looked at things that were already, uh, built
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
A:	Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're kind of rare.
B:	So we put a three car garage in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.
B:	All of it was taken up with just car space.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that,
A:	my, we've just got a two car garage,
A:	but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
B:	Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
A:	Now, mine does not work on cars,
A:	he just piddles on this and that.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
A:	It really is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,
A:	and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having,
A:	and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I, someone,
A:	I don't know,
A:	it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
B:	Right.
A:	So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.
B:	Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.
B:	His parents come
B:	and also the kids have friends who come and stay
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I still,
A:	all three of my daughters are married,
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, I understand
A:	And we've got grandchildren now,
A:	so when they come, they have to have a place.
B:	Well, we,
B:	That's true
B:	and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
A:	That's right,
A:	you sure don't.
A:	At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.
B:	Well, I I haven't reached that point yet.
B:	I've heard people say that.
B:	But, uh, my middle son is engaged,
B:	my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He's out of college and has a good job,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,
B:	but she's still in college
B:	and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's what she plans to do.
A:	Well, I don't blame you for that.
B:	So, I hope so.
A:	Well, I have the three girls
A:	and then we ended up with four grandsons.
B:	Oh, ho-ho.
A:	And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
B:	A whole new world.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses
B:	I can understand.
A:	It feels,
A:	after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,
A:	they know everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, they're fun.
B:	So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
A:	Well, I just watch them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I I never did put things up when my kids were little
A:	and I haven't with them.
A:	I try to teach them not to get into things.
B:	Well, that's the same thing that I did.
B:	I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
A:	I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.
A:	At least my daughters have.
A:	They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.
A:	So it's worked pretty well.
A:	There's,
A:	I don't really think anything's been broken.
A:	Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.
B:	Um, uh-huh
A:	But, all in all, they mind pretty well.
A:	But, I guess most of the
A:	what kind of roof does your house have?
A:	Here I'm getting off the subject.
B:	Well, we have,
A:	All right.
A:	I've never done it before,
A:	so I guess that's all I have to do, right
B:	I guess so.
A:	I've been called several times,
A:	and I push in, pushed in my number,
A:	they kept saying you have the invalid code
B:	Oh, really.
A:	and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.
B:	Oh
A:	Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
B:	I think five minutes is the max.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something,
A:	do you know?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay,
A:	well back to crime,
A:	I guess we're supposed to talk about that.
A:	They say what aspect are you worried about,
A:	well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect
B:	Right,
B:	especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex,
B:	you know, there's so much going on here.
A:	I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.
B:	Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	golly
A:	I know.
B:	and,
A:	Have they done that in Garland?
B:	No,
B:	I,
B:	not that I'm aware of.
A:	Now, um,
B:	I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
A:	Right.
B:	so, um,
A:	Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.
B:	Is that right?
A:	And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school,
A:	so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So. Yeah,
A:	it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school
A:	and you wonder if he's going to get shot.
A:	I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
B:	I know
A:	What next?
B:	I know,
B:	it's, it's, it's getting,
B:	it's been out of hand, I think, for a while,
B:	and it just continues to get worse.
A:	Right,
A:	and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this,
A:	they just can't do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's,
B:	I
B:	I agree,
B:	I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right
A:	and,
B:	and that may impact it as well.
A:	I think so,
A:	and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
B:	Yeah
A:	I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
B:	they don't think twice about it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
A:	I think it was just rare,
A:	I really do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now.
A:	She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California,
A:	and she was dating this millionaire's son
A:	and he wanted to marry her,
A:	and she wouldn't marry him
A:	and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,
A:	and, uh,
B:	You're kidding.
A:	No,
A:	I'm the one,
B:	Himself and her?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,
A:	but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
B:	Oh, wow,
B:	I bet.
A:	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
B:	Oh, I know,
A:	it's just, you know, another killing.
B:	Well, they were,
B:	I was watching some show the other day,
B:	and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently,
B:	and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,
A:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	lots of their picture and life story and everything.
B:	Right,
B:	and then you get to their life story,
B:	Oh, they came from a broken family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	oh this person had mental problems
A:	Right.
B:	oh duh, duh, duh you know,
A:	Right.
A:	I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it was on a Hard Copy,
A:	she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,
B:	Uh, I remember seeing that,
A:	Remember that?
B:	I saw that on Hard Copy
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	that's, uh,
B:	Yes.
A:	My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	can you believe it,
A:	that's just, uh,
B:	I'm trying to remember,
B:	he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something
A:	Taco Bueno,
A:	right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	I remember seeing that.
A:	Yeah, uh, uh,
A:	isn't that weird?
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
A:	I know,
A:	and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.
A:	You know, he was just begging her on the phone,
A:	that's not doing anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids
A:	not be a very good conversationalist on fishing.
A:	I don't do a lot of it.
B:	Well, I do love to fish.
A:	Well good,
A:	maybe I can learn something.
B:	Well, I don't know how much you can learn.
B:	I'm not so sure I'm good at it,
B:	but I do enjoy doing it.
A:	Do you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it is fun, what little I do.
A:	Of course, I don't, you know,
A:	I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
A:	I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm
A:	He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about
B:	Well, I hope it is,
B:	there's not a whole lot of different kinds.
A:	That's about the only kind I know how to do.
B:	I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,
B:	I, because I get seasick,
B:	but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I do a lot of fishing for, uh, bass.
B:	We have a lot of, uh, uh, couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.
A:	Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.
B:	I do.
B:	Uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,
B:	and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Fishing's a good way to do that,
B:	and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing.
A:	Do you have a boat?
B:	No,
B:	I don't.
B:	I have a friend who has a little inflatable raft,
B:	and we use that sometimes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I wish I had a boat,
B:	but I don't.
A:	I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas.
A:	The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	That's the same way here, isn't it?
A:	Is it?
B:	You have to get back in the sticks in the,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My in-laws live on a lake, uh, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,
A:	and the lake is beautiful,
A:	and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,
A:	but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.
A:	I catch a lot of little old, uh, I think they call them perch
B:	Right.
A:	and then the, the, uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait
B:	Oh.
A:	So it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit
B:	We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles,
A:	but it's kind of fun.
B:	but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.
A:	Um I would be afraid of that.
B:	And I, Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them.
A:	Do they ever get on your hook?
B:	No,
B:	we, uh,
B:	occasionally I'll catch an eel on a, on a hook, but never the snakes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They just kind of,
A:	Are they poisonous snakes?
B:	Uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,
B:	so yes
B:	they are, definitely
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in,
B:	so I seem them swimming by every once in a while.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.
A:	It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.
A:	Great big snake,
A:	and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know,
A:	but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you, you know.
A:	But it looked so bad
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,
A:	but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know
B:	Definitely.
A:	But they're scary looking.
B:	Do you have bass?
A:	Yes, uh,
A:	I think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that's pretty much the same way here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I,
A:	Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments.
B:	Well, we have those.
B:	I don't
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that's kind of,
A:	we've never entered a tournament or anything.
A:	We're not that big into fishing,
A:	but I see a lot of people,
A:	you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,
A:	and they'll say, Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,
A:	and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	So I think there's a lot of people that have, you know, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,
A:	they're really into it to try to win.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, definitely.
A:	My.
B:	Certainly here they are.
A:	But it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.
A:	The peace and calmness is really relaxing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's what I do a lot.
A:	I've never tried taking a book with me.
A:	I'll have to try that one of these days.
B:	Hi,
B:	this is Donna Donahue.
A:	Hi, Donna.
B:	Hi.
A:	Ready to get started?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I think so.
A:	Okay.
A:	Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, what did you have for lunch?
A:	Oh, it was, uh, it was,
A:	I'm an officer in the Air Force, Yeah.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	Okay.
B:	So our topic is, is food today,
B:	is that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve?
B:	Okay, uh,
B:	do you want me to go first?
A:	Sure.
B:	Okay.
B:	If I was having a dinner party I would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts.
B:	And then I would have, um, let's see. I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party Um, I would have maybe, um, say if it was like Greek night or something *sd um, maybe, um, on the barbecue we'd put, uh, cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek. And, um, like a shish kabob, and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then we'd have, um, like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, let's see what else.
B:	Um, maybe some rolls and, um, I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that.
B:	How does that sound?
A:	Jeez,
A:	well, well, when is the party here?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	that would take some planning
B:	but,
A:	I don't know
A:	being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I don't think I'd, I'd be
A:	I mean it, it's not a question of capability here to do something like that.
A:	It's just there's, there's no motivation.
B:	That's right.
A:	You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
A:	but, um,
B:	Well, that sounds good too.
B:	I have, um, I have three kids
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs
B:	and, um, usually we just have very plain kind of, you know, interesting, not very interesting meals. Pizza and that all
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun,
B:	but it's not a, not a regular thing. Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what they, they are shooting for here.
B:	Okay.
B:	Um, let's see now
B:	okay,
B:	so you would have a barbecue
A:	Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, so it,
A:	and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors,
B:	Oh, sure.
A:	like that's a little more a casual thing.
A:	But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that
A:	so we, really good place to do entertaining like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that sounds wonderful.
A:	I just haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot
A:	but, uh I don't know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	let's see.
A:	I have had, well, one time I did have a dinner party.
A:	I served a, uh, uh,
A:	I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern, uh, southern food even though I'm up here in New York,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so
B:	Oh, you are in New York right now?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
B:	I'm, I'm in Texas.
B:	I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	it is.
A:	It's,
B:	And I'm originally from Long Island.
A:	Oh, no kidding?
B:	Yes,
B:	and now where are you in New York?
A:	Upstate.
B:	Oh, upstate.
A:	Rome.
A:	In, uh, Griffins Air Force Base.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Is that where you, you are originally from around there?
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and, uh, been all over the place.
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	That's interesting.
B:	Okay,
B:	let's see.
B:	Um, well, I like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, um, everybody bring something,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that's real interesting because then you get different, um, different kinds of foods and new recipes
B:	and, um, uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like,
A:	Right.
B:	and get the recipe from them or whatever.
B:	And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food
B:	because here in Texas they have lots of, really good Mexican restaurants
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could,
A:	Sure.
B:	do you know what a fajita is?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've been down to Texas a few times, and, uh, had, uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there.
B:	Okay.
B:	Yes.
B:	They have some delicious, delicious things,
B:	and I, um,
B:	since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you boil them, maybe like four chicken breasts,
B:	and you boil them until they are cooked. Maybe like thirty minutes
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you debone them and, and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled
B:	and you take, um, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt,
A:	Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf.
A:	I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time
A:	and that's how I picked up golf.
A:	And, uh, I don't know
A:	it's just a, kind of a challenging game.
B:	It sure is.
B:	I play at least three times a week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm on it,
A:	I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play.
A:	I'm trying to get back into it.
A:	Uh, so, uh, I got to start all over again.
A:	It's not like riding a bicycle.
A:	You do tend to, forget.
B:	No.
B:	Well, I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I do enjoy playing.
A:	What is your handicap?
B:	Right now it's three.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.
A:	It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again.
B:	Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I have got to try and get out there.
A:	I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it.
A:	I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather.
B:	Uh, well, we can usually play here year around.
B:	Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,
B:	and I'm pretty much addicted to golf,
B:	so. I get out there one way or the other.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter
A:	you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out.
B:	It's a good game though.
B:	It's very challenging
B:	and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's the way I look at it.
B:	I, I play in, in a lot of groups
B:	and but I, they keep score and, between themselves
B:	but I really don't care.
B:	Um, I go out
B:	and each shot I say, well, this is what I'm going to try to do
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I see how close I can come to that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you always work on trying to improve each day
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.
B:	Either I'm not driving very well
B:	or I'm not hitting long irons very well
B:	or I'm not putting well
B:	or, but sometimes it all comes together.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know what you mean.
A:	I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, uh, chip well.
A:	One of the two, uh,
A:	or something would go wrong
A:	but I always managed to, to get near par anyway.
B:	Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I went to that.
B:	Craig Statler won in a playoff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we, uh,
B:	this is a big golf area.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We have a lot of, uh,
B:	I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst
B:	and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have, uh, long waits, uh, to get on the course?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do as a matter of fact.
B:	It, it, uh, it's only been that way in the last five years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But now you, uh,
B:	most of the courses have a, uh, two day advance tee time you have to call,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	I just moved into this small community
A:	so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here.
A:	I'm hoping that won't be,
A:	I, was from the, uh, twin cities area.
B:	That's some cold golf too, isn't it?
A:	Yeah
A:	Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather?
B:	We have cold.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Usually January and the first two weeks of February.
A:	Well, I wish that's all we had.
B:	But, uh, last week we were in the seventies.
B:	Something is coming through now
B:	so it's like in the low forties right now.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties.
B:	We have very windy winters and very cold.
A:	Yeah
B:	But we don't get any snow anymore.
B:	I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern.
B:	We used to get four or five inches a year.
B:	Now we get nothing.
B:	It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall.
A:	I see.
A:	Well, at least it, that doesn't, uh, get in the way of golfing
A:	so that
B:	No, Get out my orange golf ball and go out.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what they do here sometimes.
A:	You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there
A:	but, if you got,
B:	Okay.
A:	So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution?
B:	Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things.
B:	Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, you know,
B:	and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain,
B:	and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.
B:	It's hurting, you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry.
B:	So we're not the lone ranger here.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, I,
A:	it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your hydrocarbons, uh causing the damage in which,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit,
B:	but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot.
A:	Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter,
A:	and it got hydrocarbons in there.
A:	It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher,
A:	but it's, you know, really bad on the environment.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess I missed that one.
B:	Uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Automobiles of course are contributing, too,
B:	and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto
A:	Yeah.
B:	kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess.
A:	I know,
A:	uh, in the Twin Cities area,
A:	I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right,
A:	but they had a new policy where in order to get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh.
B:	We have that here, too,
B:	but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know,
B:	they put a probe in your exhaust pipe
B:	and, and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out,
B:	and so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, uh,
A:	yeah
A:	I guess that was just mainly in the cities there,
A:	and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that,
A:	but I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the inspection, a seventy-six,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it to meet standards.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It'd probably be difficult anyway.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution,
A:	but, uh.
B:	I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, they've got a new, uh,
B:	you know a lot of places are burning wood
A:	Yeah.
B:	a lot, a lot of people are burning wood,
B:	those of us who have,
B:	I've got a place in the country, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, they've had catalytic you know, catalytic converters on those, on,
B:	uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington,
B:	but they've had up those for quite a while,
B:	and somebody's come up with a new one that, uh, sort of,
B:	it's a, it's a catalytic converter,
B:	it's, it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.
B:	The more smoke is produced, you know,
B:	after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is.
B:	And it sounds real neat.
B:	I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet,
B:	but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That might help a little bit, especially in some places.
B:	We're really lucky here.
B:	We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now sometimes we get a kind of a,
B:	especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us,
B:	but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Probably blowing up there to you guys
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, well around here I, we get, uh,
A:	well it depends, you know,
A:	either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way,
A:	and in the summer time we probably get yours.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It comes back.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some important things.
B:	Education, raising consciousness awareness,
B:	uh, I know school kids,
B:	I work for the school district here,
B:	and, uh, you know, this is one of the big things with kids.
B:	Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, you know, telling adults to clean up their act
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, it's uh, you know,
B:	I hope we're not too late with it.
B:	We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it, uh, that's a big thing, too.
A:	I know it has nothing to do with air pollution,
A:	but I kind of look at the way people treat our,
A:	Surprised they get anybody this time of day
A:	but, I've been trying all different times,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I don't get anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night
A:	so thought,  I'll try ,
B:	Oh, well, I'm at,  work
B:	and I just happened to walk back into my office.
A:	Oh
B:	I've been gone for a little while
A:	Oh.
A:	Well, I go to school
A:	so I'm home certain days,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you?
A:	Got,
B:	I don't, I haven't ever made any.
B:	I just receive them
A:	Oh
A:	Have you, have you received many?
B:	I haven't here lately.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's, uh,
A:	well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I never had to make one.
A:	They just always came
B:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly.
A:	People must be tired of it or something.
A:	well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject,
A:	what do you think?
B:	Well, I never gave it any thought myself
B:	I was hoping you could tell me what you thought.
A:	Oh.
A:	Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that.
A:	I think it might be good for them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent.
B:	Exactly.
A:	I'm just concerned about their safety
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	That, that would be my main objection. I don't think,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know
B:	I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis
A:	it will probably never happen
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that
B:	but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well it, it probably won't.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't, I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway.
A:	We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's another consideration
B:	Exactly
A:	But, uh, I don't know
A:	some kids are so spoiled nowadays
A:	it might be a real eye opener, you know
B:	Really
A:	I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
A:	and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
A:	and then they think,
A:	they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl
B:	I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while
A:	Oh
A:	Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?
B:	Wouldn't it though?
A:	I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it is.
A:	I know.
A:	Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world,  and helping some countries I never even heard of.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know it.
A:	It seems to me we are,
A:	it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, what do I know, right?
A:	I'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up,
A:	nobody has called me from Washington
A:	Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program?
B:	I work at T I.
A:	Oh, you do work at T I?
A:	Oh, you're in Lewisville.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I just went by that place.
A:	We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost
A:	and, uh we went by.
A:	That's the first time I'd seen it.
A:	It looked really nice.
B:	Yeah.
A:	A lot of trees there.
A:	It looked like a pretty little, a sight.
B:	Hang on a minute.
A:	Sure.
B:	to someone in the No,
B:	I don't think so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	Patty might.
B:	I'm back.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	But how did you get on it?
A:	Well, my husband works at T I over on Central.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure
A:	but, he works over there
A:	and
A:	we did it last time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time.
A:	I don't know,
A:	they didn't even ask him back
B:	Really?
A:	That was weird, wasn't it?
B:	Huh.
A:	But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't get too many.
A:	And I can never find anybody.
B:	Huh.
A:	So, um,
B:	The first time I used to get calls from far away too.
A:	Right.
B:	Like Maryland,  and New Jersey,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've had the same experiences,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	all right around here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know, uh,
A:	I wonder if they really,
A:	I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents.
A:	There's just, there's so many with this one town you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	even in some families some people talk a little bit different.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	My husband is from New Jersey
A:	and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me
A:	and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way,
A:	and that's one family, right?
A:	Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny
A:	but
B:	Oh, I agree.
A:	You know, how that goes
B:	Oh, shoot.
A:	Oh, God.
A:	Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet.
A:	Sometimes she says at night. Or, or or overloads
B:	Yeah.
A:	so please end your conversation.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?
B:	No,
B:	I sure don't
A:	You don't have any kids you want to send over here?
B:	No,
B:	no kids
A:	Well, is
B:	Oh, shoot.
A:	Well, uh, I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto.
A:	Well, one of them is real idealistic,
A:	she might
B:	My sister is,
B:	I'd be more suited to that than her
B:	she's just bugs,
B:	Okay,
B:	you ready?
A:	Yeah,
A:	is that it?
B:	That's it.
A:	Okay,
A:	Uh, well, we, I guess we have to talk about magazines
A:	and, uh, what, what,
B:	What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you?
A:	Well, I subscribe to well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time.
A:	I do, you know,
A:	I enjoy PEOPLE.
A:	And now I'm, uh, I, uh, subscribe to, uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL.
B:	I, uh, take a computer magazine. And, uh, also, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	are you interested in, in computers?
B:	And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, that, that would be one of my peeves.
A:	My pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially,
A:	I mean, it's, it's really geared to,
A:	all they have,
A:	you have too many recipes first of all.
A:	I just don't, you know,
A:	that's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines.
A:	Too many recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense.
A:	I, you know, I like to read articles about things that matter.
A:	Well, of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh, your more intellectual magazines,
A:	but it's nice, light reading
A:	You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book.
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	I, uh, I like it when they have short stories.
B:	Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it.
A:	Well, that's true,
A:	yeah,
A:	they did.
B:	And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while
B:	so I guess
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
A:	Well, is REDBOOK still in existence?
A:	I don't know if they're, if they're around anymore.
B:	Yeah
B:	I think it is.
B:	it's an institution,
B:	surely it would have to be.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, uh, I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of,
A:	which I think it was either,
A:	yeah,
A:	it was Publisher's Clearinghouse
B:	Right
A:	They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list
A:	So,
B:	Mine, too
B:	This was it, my last chance
A:	Yeah,
A:	my last, right, my last chance to win ten million dollars,
A:	so I figured, hey, look For twelve dollars, you know,
B:	Well, I, I, I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh, to, uh, ENTERTAINMENT.
A:	That's it.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	oh, uh-huh.
B:	And I was real disappointed with it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I don't know,
B:	it just,
B:	not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into.
A:	Right.
B:	It's little short articles more than anything else.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE.
B:	Uh, it 's just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it.
A:	Well, I don't know,
A:	I just think, uh, you know, it's,  It's light reading.
B:	If you've only got a short time to read
A:	You know, you don't have, well, you don't have to concentrate, you know you know.
B:	No,
B:	that's true
A:	It's entertaining, you know,
A:	and, uh, that's,
A:	I just, I enjoy it,
A:	I, you know, I, uh
A:	Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is very,
A:	wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	not really.
B:	I mean, not the one I take now.
B:	It's a, it's a magazine
B:	and it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	And, uh, I'm a real movie buff,
B:	so that's why I thought I might be interested in it,
B:	but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, uh, the HOME JOURNAL and the, uh, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me.
A:	Oh.
B:	Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, oh, I really need to read this
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, like maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three,
A:	if I read three articles in, in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did really well.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Because there's just nothing in there that interests me.
A:	I don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes
A:	and
B:	Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts.
A:	See, now, and I'm not into crafts,
A:	so, you know, that, that eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine You know.
B:	That's true.
A:	Well, I just got the new issue,
A:	they have Bette Midler on the cover,
A:	so that should be one article that I'll read anyway
B:	Do you, uh,
A:	So, how is the weather out there?
B:	Uh, it's really cold
B:	and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
B:	and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff.
B:	How about you guys?
A:	Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.
A:	The usual, I think.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff
A:	It's good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's,
B:	because I have lived in Utah for like ten years.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	What part?
B:	And, uh,
B:	Provo.
B:	I was going to B Y U.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, the snow is like, really cold.
B:	I mean, it's, like, really humid
B:	so it seems wetter or something like that.
B:	It's,
A:	It's more humid in Utah than there?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or there?
B:	It's more humid in Iowa than Utah.
A:	Okay.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
B:	And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you.
B:	It's really different from Utah's weather.
B:	I thought Utah was cold,
B:	but I think Iowa is a lot colder
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, that's how it is in Texas, too
A:	because when it's cold, it's really cold.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind
A:	What's that?
B:	I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So the humidity is I think what does it
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's true.
A:	Because I, I noticed when I got here, too,
A:	because like I'd,
A:	when it would snow in Texas uh, I would just, I mean we'd be really cold
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we'd have to get really warm,
A:	and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
A:	and you don't you don't feel super cold.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	It was weird.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, so how long ago did you graduate?
A:	Or did you,
A:	or,
B:	Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	my husband got his doctorate at B Y U,
B:	so that's,
B:	and so he just graduated this past year.
A:	Oh.
A:	So you just barely moved away?
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Yeah, Well, we really miss Utah
A:	Do you like it out there?
B:	We miss the mountains.
A:	You do?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because it's, like, really flat here
B:	Well, not flat, but hilly.
B:	But no big mountains or anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you just moved away a year ago?
B:	Uh, in August.
A:	Wow, really recent.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather.
B:	Uh, well, today was warmer
B:	It was like forty-five
A:	Oh, warm
B:	So, what's the temperature up today over there?
A:	Oh, man,
A:	it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Maybe not that warm.
A:	Probably about, uh,
A:	yeah.
A:	It's not, it's not that cold, really.
B:	And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But they talk about wind chill here all the time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a big deal in Texas, too.
B:	They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill.
A:	Um.
B:	So, that's what we're not used to
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	That makes a big difference. Huh.
B:	So, oh, I,
A:	So, did you used to ski when you were out here?
B:	What's that?
A:	Did you used to ski when you were in Utah?
B:	Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	I only skied once my whole life
B:	But, do you do a lot of skiing there?
A:	Uh, not tons,
A:	but I like to when I get a chance.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then.
A:	Just saving my money for Christmas things and that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So is this your first year in Utah?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	this is actually my third year.
B:	And you're going to school there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yep.
B:	At U of U,
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	at B Y U.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate.
B:	What's your major?
A:	Uh, it was nursing,
A:	but I'm in the process of changing it right now.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	oh.
A:	Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You have to have like a three seven to get in
A:	so, It's really,
B:	That's true.
A:	I'm going to look into some other fields.
A:	I'd like,
A:	all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much
A:	so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's a good idea.
A:	Did you graduate in a certain field
A:	or,
B:	Uh, education.
B:	I got a double major.
A:	In,
B:	Uh, elementary and special ed.
A:	Really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That what my sister did.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	you might know her.
A:	Here name is Lori, Bird.
A:	Maybe not
A:	I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,
A:	but, she got her
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I can't,
B:	there are so many girls in all my classes,
B:	I can't remember how many people.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Because they, since, uh, stopped that program. I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily.
B:	Oh, have they?
B:	Oh.
A:	I mean, it's, it's really,
A:	We're set.
B:	Okay.
A:	What changes do you feel have happened?
B:	Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote.
B:	I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were
B:	and that's probably going to increase. You know.
A:	Right.
A:	Increases each year, doesn't it?
B:	I'm sorry?
A:	It increases each year I think.
B:	It sure does.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.
A:	Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.
B:	Role?
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh,
B:	That's changing
A:	Well, we do to some degree
B:	Right.
A:	but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I agree.
B:	It definitely has changed.
A:	I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.
B:	Well, you know, they've been talking about
B:	and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it,
B:	but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that
B:	and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out,
A:	Right.
B:	but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.
A:	Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave.
A:	Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave.
B:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do,
A:	but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either
A:	and that was the reason
A:	because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
A:	but, So, uh,
B:	Huh, that's interesting.
B:	That's a bummer, though
A:	Yeah
A:	it is.
B:	I mean, You got to take the time off
A:	You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time.
A:	You do.
A:	You have to save all your vacation time
A:	and that's usually how it's, uh, happened,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you see, uh, changing in the future?
B:	I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females.
A:	Right,
A:	and, and  top level.
B:	And we'll
B:	I'm sorry?
A:	Maybe top level.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	upper management,
B:	more women in upper management
B:	and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.
B:	More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that.
A:	That would be kind of nice
B:	Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
B:	And we had a female mayor here in Dallas,
B:	and she just, her term just ended
B:	and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future
A:	Yeah
A:	I think that's probably good.
A:	A little more integration.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
A:	and,
B:	Right, you know,
B:	I mean, and that's fine with me
A:	I think,
B:	but sometimes,
B:	I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means,
B:	but I do,
A:	Right.
B:	there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.
A:	Right.
B:	But, I don't get into the, uh, the real  women libber movement, you know.
A:	No,
A:	I don't either.
A:	I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
B:	Yeah.
A:	We just function differently
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	and they're probably,
A:	I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I've heard of that.
B:	Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that.
B:	But, I mean, I think that is a,
A:	I think that,
B:	Like the cottage industry.
B:	Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes?
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I think it's wonderful
A:	Right.
A:	You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,
B:	Oh, I
B:	By the phone and all that.
A:	so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that
A:	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.
B:	Right.
A:	Think anybody could do it,
A:	but, Anyway,
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	but then you know, there is the process of selection.
A:	Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	and, would be nice, though.
A:	How big is Provo?
B:	Um.
A:	That a little town or, or a bigger city?
B:	Um, it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, um, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller.
B:	Plano, Texas. No *nn
A:	Oh.
A:	I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I forgot the name of the town.
A:	I thought maybe it was you
A:	Oh, well, anyway, we're supposed to talk about education.
A:	I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college.
A:	I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic in grade school,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to,
A:	and it shows up.
A:	That's one idea.
A:	Do you have any?
B:	Um, I don't know,
B:	I'm pretty, I think I'm pretty satisfied with, um,
B:	I I grew up in Plano
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and my dad is actually on the school board there,
B:	so, I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's
A:	Plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years
B:	Yeah.
A:	that's for sure.
A:	It used to be the pits.
A:	And Arlington is excellent now,
A:	but I'm just speaking overall across the country.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Something is definitely wrong.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing,
A:	so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year
A:	and they truly can't read
B:	Right.
A:	so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math.
A:	So, um, that's definitely a problem.
A:	Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.
B:	Right.
A:	But, um,
B:	So do you, what do you think is good about the schools?
A:	That is good about,
A:	well, it depends on where you are.
A:	They're all so different.
A:	That's another thing about the United States.
B:	Yeah.
A:	There's no national curriculum, you know,
A:	I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class
A:	you may have half literature for the whole year,
A:	whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature,
B:	Grammar.
A:	it's up to the teacher, in other words.
A:	So that's kind of you know, that's kind of odd to me.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or is how you end up
A:	Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,
A:	so I guess we lucked out when we moved here.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point,
A:	and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?
A:	I don't know.
A:	I just read about that the other day,
A:	and I had never even thought of it.
A:	Actually it makes sense to a certain extent,
A:	because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh,
A:	they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know. and according to her plan,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know.
B:	Um.
A:	That's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more more citizens percentage wise that can read and write,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.
A:	I don't know.
A:	Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet,
A:	so I probably can't
A:	But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write
A:	because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah *aa
A:	So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades
A:	and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago,
A:	and that's a big jump.
B:	I believe that
A:	Did you go to school in Plano?
B:	I did.
A:	Through high school.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh,
A:	Up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?
B:	We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem.
A:	Do you really?
B:	Our summers are extremely, uh, hazardous
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and during, uh, certain wind directions because we get the, uh, Gary, Indiana Chicago pollution
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh coming up along the lake.
A:	That's horrible.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In the winter it's not as severe.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,
B:	but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, triggering, uh, awareness.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So what's the conditions like in Dallas?
A:	Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver.
A:	I grew up in Denver,
A:	and, and I've lived there most of my life,
A:	and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days.
A:	Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down,
A:	probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.
B:	Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable.
A:	Um.
B:	So, they've, they've tried to do a lot of that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I
B:	you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets,
B:	and we were talking earlier about Madison
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in Wisconsin
A:	Oh, really.
B:	and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there is a, a real promotion of, of biking
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, there are still a lot of people who insist on, on driving their own automobiles uh, to go everywhere.
A:	Right.
B:	I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	it, it becomes, uh,
A:	maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is.
A:	Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be.
B:	Send, send them to Wisconsin,
B:	and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain
A:	Oh really
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they'll, they'll, they may wake up, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here.
A:	Do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles
A:	or does it come mostly from industry up there?
B:	I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the Gary area
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that causes the acid rain.
B:	That I'm a little uncertain of,
B:	but I do know that, uh, it is a problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I had talked with my parents.
A:	I, I grew up, uh, I was born in, uh, Muncie, Indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute,
A:	and I had asked them before, uh,
A:	I went back to visit recently, about a year ago,
A:	and I asked them,
A:	I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was,
A:	I'm sorry, um
B:	That's okay,
B:	I didn't hear.
A:	hobbies.
B:	Okay.
A:	Let me see,
A:	I don't know if that took or not,
A:	I'll do it again.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	What are your hobbies?
A:	I hear you have kids, right?
B:	You heard her in the background
B:	That's babies.
A:	That's your full time, uh, hobby, right?
B:	Takes a lot of time, huh.
B:	I like, uh, most sports.
B:	I like to do that.
B:	I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you like to do?
A:	Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it
B:	Well, I'm sure you probably are.
A:	Well, no,
A:	not really.
B:	You like it,
B:	that's the main .
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, I always try.
A:	I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity.
A:	Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm,
B:	Oh, boy, that's hard sewing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it isn't and it is.
A:	It is, you know,
A:	actually the sewing isn't the hard part,
A:	it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room.
B:	Measure it and get it to,
B:	Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it.
B:	If you get pleats and all kinds of,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've been doing that
A:	and, That,
B:	That's a lot of work.
A:	yeah,
A:	that,
A:	but usually have to do the pleats by hand.
A:	So that, at least I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever
B:	Oh.
A:	but,
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through
A:	but,
B:	That feels really good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it.
B:	To do it,
B:	right.
A:	I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish.
A:	Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby.
B:	Keeping fish .
B:	Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.
A:	Um, yes and no.
A:	It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you.
B:	Oh, no.
B:	How much that bothers you,
B:	and you probably have to clean out the tank too.
A:	That's,
A:	you don't have to do as much as, as I thought.
A:	In fact, my problem,
A:	I had fish as a kid
A:	and they always died immediately,
B:	Oh, no.
A:	and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean
B:	Oh, you're kidding
A:	because you have,
B:	because they need to have a little bit of the,
A:	Right,
A:	you need to let the bacteria build up,
A:	and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.
B:	I see.
A:	And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water
B:	Oh, no.
A:	and it would kill all the bacteria,
A:	and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
B:	And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably.
A:	so.
A:	Right.
A:	That's right.
A:	So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and I don't try and sterilize things
B:	Don't go through the whole nine yards
B:	and they kind of need a little bit of that.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	So you've had fish for a long time.
A:	Well, I've had them,
A:	I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here,
A:	and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank.
A:	But that never worked well. I have fifty-five gallons now. *sd
B:	What size do you have now?
B:	Oh, that's a good size.
A:	It's a lot easier.
B:	Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak.
A:	No
A:	No,
A:	not yet.
B:	Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.
A:	That's right,
A:	I really do.
A:	But, you know.
B:	Do you have all kinds of different fish
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't get into the
B:	Real exotic.
A:	right,
A:	right.
A:	The expensive ones.
B:	Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of
B:	and,
A:	They are.
A:	They're very expensive
A:	and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment.
B:	Yes,
B:	I bet it is.
A:	You lost an investment
A:	so,
B:	Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other?
A:	No,
A:	not really.
A:	Only if there's baby fish.
B:	Right.
A:	You always have to isolate those.
B:	Then you have to,
B:	how do you isolate them?
A:	You get a
B:	A jar or something
B:	or.
A:	well, no,
A:	they have breeders.
B:	Okay.
A:	It's a little plastic things that sort of floats
B:	Okay.
A:	and you put the mother fish in there
A:	and then it's got like a trough underneath her
B:	Okay.
A:	so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough
A:	and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either.
B:	Oh.
A:	And that's, you know,
A:	it kind of works,
A:	but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate
B:	Right.
A:	it'll fit out the slots.
B:	It'll go through the slot.
A:	That's right,
A:	so. But, you know, it works, I guess.
B:	That works all right then.
B:	They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.
A:	Oh, they'll eat them.
B:	They will.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Isn't that odd.
A:	Yes.
B:	You wouldn't think that.
A:	It, and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.
B:	You're kidding.
A:	Oh, no.
A:	All the time,
A:	and, um, I,
A:	and she's supposed to,
A:	her variety, it says they won't eat the babies,
A:	and I've seen her do it.
A:	So.
B:	And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?
A:	Oh, it's
A:	well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different
B:	Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.
A:	We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't,
A:	but you know, that's the way it is for them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's kind of the way they do it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's it.
B:	Survival of the fittest or something.
A:	Yes,
A:	because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide.
B:	Right.
B:	Go hide from them,
B:	well and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that,
A:	So.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.
A:	No,
A:	not really.
A:	I, I try.
A:	I also, I play a couple of instruments.
A:	Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team.
A:	That's pretty easy to say nowadays
A:	Lot easier than it was a couple years ago,
A:	but they had a big win today.
A:	Uh, did you get to watch it?
B:	No,
B:	I didn't.
B:	I, uh, have been at my computer all day
B:	so,
A:	Oh.
A:	Are you a Cowboy fan?
B:	Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan
B:	and, and, uh, I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan.
B:	Being an Okie I just really don't care much, uh,
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	it's, it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They've always been, you know, my favorite.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, and and I guess I still have a soft spot.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So, now have they,
B:	they're in the playoffs, right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they made it to the playoffs finally
A:	like just, you know, two years ago they were one and fifteen.
A:	They won like just one game
A:	and so pretty fast turnaround.
A:	But this year they made it to playoffs
A:	and today was the first game
A:	and they beat the Chicago Bears
A:	so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here.
B:	I'll bet they are.
A:	They're going crazy,
A:	so, so they turned it around,
A:	but, you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh,
A:	I mean, everybody was real upset, you know, when they fired Tom Landry,
A:	but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that.
B:	Uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hit a bad season
B:	and it's, you know, the coach's fault,
B:	let's, let's dump him.
A:	Right.
B:	First good season, the coach can do no wrong.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly. You know.
B:	But they Dallas has always been good ahead, you know, heading good players and both running, running backs and, and defense.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	uh, you know, they have a young team.
A:	It's, you know, a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, you know, players every year and, you know, same coach, same everything,
A:	so, now it's, you know, like a taste of something different.
A:	They're all not, you know, mister nice guys like they used to be.
A:	Now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team
A:	so everybody is really excited.
A:	And,
B:	Who is the competition going to be?
A:	Well, it's supposed to be the Redskins, but you know, we beat them already.
A:	We beat them this year in, in Washington
A:	so, you know, so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl,
A:	but, you know, it's just that we have to play every game away, you know,
A:	it's going to be tough,
A:	but, but
A:	the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year,
A:	so, I mean, Atlanta, they're in it, too,
A:	and we beat them
A:	and, uh, see, Detroit, we play them next week,
A:	but, you know, we should beat them.
A:	Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them
A:	so, it's, so everything's, uh, looking real good.
B:	Course, I think, you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season injuries that heal
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	and, you know it can be a or injuries that, uh, have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well the Cowboys are on a roll.
A:	They've won, like, I think six or seven in a row now,
A:	so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the league going into the playoffs
A:	so,
B:	But, but since you have an O U drop out as a quarterback,
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	Troy Aikman,
A:	he got hurt at O U,
A:	so he transferred to U C L A.
B:	Well, Well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U.
A:	Right.
B:	O U has always been known for their running game.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	More than,
A:	They're playing tonight in fact.
B:	Right.
A:	I'm watching them on T V right now.
A:	But they're doing some stomping on Virginia.
B:	Oh, I tell you,
B:	they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless their little hearts
A:	Really?
A:	Well, they're doing good tonight.
B:	Are they?
A:	Yeah
B:	I haven't been watching.
A:	they're winning. They're winning forty-one to seven.
B:	Well, good for us
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	and, uh, that's right,
A:	Aikman did go to O U.
A:	I forgot about that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they
B:	then he went out to S, to southern Cal.
B:	Is that where he went?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, U C L A.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	But, the Cowboys did good today.
A:	I mean, I was proud.
A:	I thought, I thought they would get beat today because, I mean they're so young, you know,
A:	playoffs,
A:	You bet.
A:	They tell you our topic?
B:	Uh, pets.
A:	You've got it.
B:	Do you have pets?
A:	Yes,
A:	we do.
A:	Uh, my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old,
A:	and we have a, a cat, which is, uh, I guess about five years old.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	How about you guys?
B:	We have three dogs and two birds at this point.
A:	Three dogs.
A:	And two
A:	what kind of birds do you have?
B:	Parakeets.
A:	No, kidding.
A:	enjoy them?
B:	Oh, have a ball with them.
A:	You let them out and let them fly around and everything?
B:	Well, no,
B:	because my dogs chase them.
A:	Okay.
B:	So in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages.
A:	You know, this is like a cruelty joke,
A:	and I apologize if you're a bird lover,
A:	but, uh, we had a parakeet. And, my fault, put up our first electric fan. And never thought about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Knocked that parakeet right out of the air.
B:	Well, we had that happen once, um,
B:	my son had the bird back in his room,
B:	because it's his well, the first one that we had was his bird,
B:	and I had a ceiling fan put up,
B:	and it, the bird got away from him one afternoon,
B:	and I mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall,
B:	I thought, oh so much for the bird.
A:	It killed him?
B:	No,
B:	he's still alive and kicking.
A:	Oh, that's,
A:	well, it killed ours,
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	No,
B:	I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot,
B:	but it threw him up against the wall, you know,
B:	and he slid down the wall. Oh, I hate them. *sd
A:	Well, speaking of pets, I'll tell you, my, my kids are older now,
A:	my, both of them are either in or out of college,
A:	but, but we had for years, about five years I guess, had a, my son had a Burmese boa constrictor,
A:	and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in, in length,
A:	and finally my wife, wife, bless her heart, got rid of it, because I didn't really like it.
A:	We also had a,
A:	one year down in Florida on a vacation, for Father's Day, my kids, years ago, maybe, uh, ten years ago, go, bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop.
A:	It'd be like, it'd been like deactivated as far as smell and everything,
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years,
A:	and, and my son left, went to school,
A:	we finally sold his boa constrictor,
A:	but my son needed some money,
A:	and we, we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars.
B:	You're kidding.
A:	So, when the guy came over, he was infatuated by that skunk,
A:	so I made him a deal,
A:	I said, You take that skunk,
A:	and, he said, I'll sell that snake to you for two fifty.
A:	I said, otherwise I'm going to give it to this other man.
A:	So he took the skunk, too.
A:	And the skunk was a good, a decent pet,
A:	but, you know, does his little jobbies in the litter box,
A:	and is, is.
B:	Oh well, that's pretty good.
A:	And it was sort of a neat,
A:	but, they just stink too much
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	oh, yeah.
A:	That was sort of fun, you know,
A:	I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover.
A:	I use to visualize my wife,
A:	many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa,
A:	and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body  and with his, with his head right on her neck
B:	Oh, you're kidding.
B:	Oh.
A:	and the skunk would be sitting at her feet,
A:	but the cat would be on the back of the sofa,
A:	and a dog would be running around crazy
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	I can not
B:	I just, I don't,
B:	in fact my brother has a, uh, a exotic pet shop out in California,
B:	and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail, you know,
B:	I'm going  don't do that, because they won't come in my house.
A:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Oh, my son bought this snake, uh,
A:	someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school,
A:	and it was just a small thing then,
A:	but it got to be pretty big,
A:	and, you know, you'd feed it, you'd feed it, you put, feed him small mice to big rats and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's just, uh, too much.
A:	That snake used to watch our cat walk around.
A:	I always told my wife,
A:	I says  you know, your friend's going to get our cat one of these days
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	That is wild.
B:	Oh, I just can't do those, and the lizards and the all those those things,
A:	Oh, me neither.
B:	they, they need to stay outside, far away from me.
A:	We're down to a simple dog and cat now,
A:	and that's the way it should be,
A:	and.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Haven't had any parakeets for quite a while,
A:	birds.
A:	Uh, customer of mine has a parrot,
A:	and, uh, gosh, sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot,
A:	and that was just mind boggling.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	they are so expensive.
B:	Well, my son was just dying for a bird,
B:	and I'm really allergic to them,
B:	so I try to stay away from them, except I've gotten real attached to this one,
A:	Are you?
B:	and, and, uh, we went down to Canton one time oh, gosh, two or three years ago now,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he'd saved up his allowance, you know, and picked him out a bird in a bird cage
B:	and, and that stinking bird, when I brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you
A:	Yes.
B:	clamped onto my finger and would not,
B:	I mean, I had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage,
B:	and he has tried to bite me for two years,
B:	and all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends.
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	He gives me kisses,
B:	he talks now
A:	That's neat.
B:	and it's just hysterical.
B:	I'm the only one that pays attention to him.
A:	Why, sure.
B:	And I'm a substitute teacher
B:	and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said, high-pitched like a child's my mom's making me get rid of the bird,
B:	we have too many pets.
B:	I thought, yeah, right come tell me about it, you know.
A:	Come to my menagerie.
B:	They knew the sucker when they saw one.
B:	So now we have two parakeets.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	so you enjoy camping?
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh like you, I haven't done any in quite some time  except for what I call living now which is, which is very close to camping
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	Is it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I, uh, camped in the Boy Scouts
B:	and, you know, my dad and I went out sometimes
B:	but uh, even my first, uh, eight or nine years of working, I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, when you have to have it, you have got to have it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, in those those kinds of situations, uh, room rent which is outrageous.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, my buddy and I, we just camped
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we figured, what the hell,
B:	we did it when we were kids
B:	and we loved it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.
B:	When, when I was in high school,
B:	he is a couple years older than me
B:	and, uh, he graduated and went off to college
B:	and, uh, during the summer we would camp out at the lake.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove
A:	Oh, well Yeah.
B:	You know, I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, well, it was fantastic.
B:	We would get up in the morning, go skiing, uh,
B:	that substituted for a shower
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and then we would go to work and uh, come back to the, uh, you know, boat house at night
B:	and, uh, in the afternoon, you know, it is still four o'clock.
B:	You have got four hours of day light, good skiing left.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it was great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, you know, now all my life is more like camping than not camping really.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have electricity out there.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You've got a phone obviously
B:	Well, actually as a matter of fact, they just ran the phone three years ago.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We didn't have a phone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They didn't have phone lines.
B:	You just couldn't get phones.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, we are at the end of the mail route
A:	Yeah.
B:	Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess so, huh.
B:	But, uh, you know, right now, uh, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed, And, uh, swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm in construction
B:	and, uh, you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here, you know, putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I came home from work one Friday afternoon
B:	and our truck was back.
B:	Everything we had was in boxes
B:	and my wife said, uh, we're moving.
A:	Uh.
B:	And I said where.
B:	And she said out to the trailer.
B:	And I said, oh.
B:	She said yep
B:	and I said okay
A:	Uh.
B:	So, we have been roughing it out here for about three years,
B:	but it is not bad.
B:	I, we have color T V, microwave you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	it is not horrible,
B:	but it's, it's a lot like camping.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I grew up in California, in  in central California right in the valley.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains
A:	and, uh, so my dad loved fishing and camping.
A:	So we would go up.
A:	First, we went up just to, uh, with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our, uh, hot dogs by the fire or whatever.
B:	Sure.
A:	But then later my mom and dad got a camper
A:	so, uh  we have kind of moved up.
B:	Became civilized.
A:	Yeah.
A:	A little bit in the world.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my mom goes camping you know.
B:	She takes her, uh, motor home.
B:	You know, she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning, color T V, microwave oven  you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	She just,
B:	roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. You know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, you know, she has a lot of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And mostly, it is just a way to,
B:	she, she goes to dog shows.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	See, she shows dogs
B:	and, uh, you can sneak a dog into a motel
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.
A:	No
B:	So, she, uh, you know, takes the motor home
B:	And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she,
B:	if he would buy her a motor home
B:	So he did
B:	But as far as camping, my wife and I have plans to, uh, not really camp per se, but to drive up the, uh, you know, Highway One there in California uh, as soon as we get this house finished.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh that's, uh,  That will be pretty.
B:	I am going to need a vacation
A:	That's really pretty out there.
A:	There are a lot of nice places,
A:	Well, what kind of vacations do you like to take? .
B:	Well, we've, uh, we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe
B:	so So, I, I guess those are the types I like
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We've really enjoyed them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Where have you gone there?
B:	We've gone to, um, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and England.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We've been to Germany twice.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	well, I've been over there too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Where have you been?
A:	I even.
A:	Let's see, um,
A:	mostly Germany and France.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I lived in France for a year and a half
A:	so I was able,
B:	Oh, how neat.
A:	but, I, once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because, uh, I've got relatives there
A:	and I just  like it there.
B:	Oh, that's neat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, but, um, Austria, I found really pretty and Switzerland,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	yeah,
A:	and I, I lived in the Alps in France
A:	so I anything in the mountains over there I just love.
B:	Oh, how neat.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Then I finally made it to England, too, uh, on my way home, um,
A:	I lived in Africa, actually,
A:	and on my way home from there.
B:	You lived in Africa?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, my goodness
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, um, and you always have to go out, fly through, or unless you fly from Nairobi, you have to fly through, um, uh, Europe on your way home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I went to England,
A:	and I really liked it there too.
B:	It's so expensive over there
A:	I know,
A:	it's true.
A:	That's the one thing.
B:	It really is.
B:	It just, it's, it's,
B:	I love to go over there,
B:	but it's so darn expensive to go over.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	actually now you can get some really good deals flying over,
A:	but it's
B:	Yeah.
A:	once you're there you still have to spend money Unless you know people, you know
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	just.
B:	Right.
B:	Then you can stay with them,
B:	and  yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That helps a lot.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But.
B:	You know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I'd like to go to Hawaii some time,
B:	and and, uh, we made it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	we've, we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Feel like we've accomplished a little bit here.
A:	I haven't.
A:	I've been, I've,
A:	most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or this summer I went to Colorado
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I'd love to go to the East Coast, during the Fall.
B:	The, oh, the
B:	it's, oh,
B:	I've always wanted to go there.
B:	I've seen pictures,
B:	and, and it looks gorgeous.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We, um, we made a trip up the East Coast.
B:	It was, uh, in the summer
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it really is pretty.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, uh,
B:	both coasts are really pretty
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, um, I love the Carolinas.
B:	It's just gorgeous over there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I haven't been there, anywhere on the East Coast.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and, and go over there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but there's, you know, there's a lot to see here
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I just love going over to Europe because it's so, their way of life is just so different than ours.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, we're so fast paced here,
B:	and over there, you know, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	they're so leisurely over there
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's kind of nice to, to have that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So the type of vacation you'd like, um,
A:	like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week?
B:	Well, usually a bunch of different places.
A:	Yeah,
A:	mainly probably because you want to see everything.
B:	Right,
B:	see as much as you can while you're there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	How did you like Africa?
A:	Well, I liked it.
A:	I was working in Cameroon, Africa
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's not a, it's not a place for tourists,
A:	I mean, they're not used to having tourists there,
A:	so it's,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're kind of roughing it.
A:	But, um, I liked it,
A:	I liked it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The people there are just very, very friendly
A:	and.
B:	What type of work?
A:	Um, I was working with an organization that does Bible translation.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So I was doing linguistic work actually, travelling around, finding out about languages, and uh, what they call survey work.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Find out where the languages are.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	That's neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I enjoyed it.
A:	So.
B:	I've, I've always, um, I've talked to people who have been to Africa,
B:	and they,
B:	and then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my cousin came over while I was there,
A:	and she came to Cameroon
A:	and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know, close to Nairobi in Kenya.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh how neat.
A:	So, she'd always dreamed of doing that too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's great.
A:	So. Yeah.
A:	So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
B:	Uh.
A:	It sounds like we've been to some of the same places.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it does.
A:	Well, uh, I don't know.
A:	I think the budget is really out of hand right now,
A:	and especially in this election year, I think that, uh, there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering, you know, their token little tax cut program, you know, when it's when it's just such a bad time for it.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	and, uh, well, as you said, mostly they are token cuts.
A:	Uh  especially what, for instance, George Bush is offering.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The ninety-seven cents a week
A:	Yeah,
A:	ninety-seven cents a week.
A:	Now what,
A:	that's really not going to do a lot of good, it doesn't seem to me, to your average middle income person, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Another ninety-seven cents,
A:	hell you can buy a coke or something for that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut,
B:	it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, yeah
B:	I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot.
A:	That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Uh, I, I haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either,
A:	especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, you know, in retrospect, um, was it, was it Mondale or Dukakis that said, you know, I'll, I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes?
A:	I believe it was Dukakis
B:	It was Dukakis,
B:	yeah.
A:	but I, I can't.
B:	I have a lot of respect for him
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said, No,
A:	I will not and then, you know, ten months later he said, well, sorry, you know, I, I can't follow through on this.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it seems to me that, uh, that the budget is so out of hand,
A:	and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over
A:	and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of, you know  of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go,
A:	because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace, so-called peace dividend.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's.
A:	I mean, if they could actually put something together and make,
A:	I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste money, also,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I, uh, I, I think that would be a great idea, you know, like the conservation corps, you know where.
A:	Right, Exactly
B:	It it it would help unemployment greatly.
B:	And it.
A:	and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country.
B:	Yeah,
B:	infra structure is in, is in,
B:	I mean, we, we, we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the  cold war.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and  and there's no way that we can ever really recover from, from the state that we're in right now, unless, at least I feel, unless we focus on the infra structure,
A:	and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	I, I agree totally
B:	Um, I mean, this, this, it just seems so, you know, so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen.
B:	Um, I, I'm in college right now,
B:	and.
A:	So am I.
B:	Oh really,
B:	where do you go?
A:	Uh, I U.
B:	Right,
B:	I go to Georgia Tech, um.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, in,
B:	what,
B:	I had you know, the required political science class a couple of years ago.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And one of the things we discussed was, you know, where our, where the budget how the budget situation just got so out of hand.
A:	Right.
B:	And essentially what happened was,
B:	I think it was like in the, um, tax year of eighty-one, um,
B:	Ronald Reagan basically said, you know, I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and, and, created this, this ludicrous budget that he knew, that, that, um, that the Congress would not in their right mind pass
A:	Right.
B:	and Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, you know, bye-bye, you know, bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created, you know, that, that, that, you know, created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	And you just, .
A:	You, you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington.
B:	I mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, well, it's, it's more than a loaded,
A:	it's a loaded cannon.
A:	I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. Uh-huh. *b
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	um, what really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were to say, you know, well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're , we're going to have to do some unpopular things, I mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected.
B:	I mean, it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing, you know where people just want, want to have, you know, whatever will make them feel good, right now, you know.
A:	For, for the moment,
A:	and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It,
B:	I mean, I don't know,
B:	I I don't, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	not at all.
B:	I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.
A:	No.
A:	, how do you feel about crime in the city?
A:	You say you're from Atlanta.
B:	Right,
B:	I, I, I actually I live in the city
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I guess it is a concern of mine, uh, you know, for my own safety.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, do you, do you find crime in Atlanta really
A:	I live in Atlanta also.
B:	Well that's right. Uh, I think it is bad in certain areas, *sv
A:	Uh.
B:	however I think, the area that I live in it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?
B:	Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,
B:	and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .
A:	I probably agree with that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.
B:	They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's probably true.
A:	Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?
B:	Um, well, I've been to,
B:	I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.
B:	Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't think it's as bad as L A either.
B:	No.
A:	We, I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that seems to be true.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	if you've ever been to like New York City
B:	and you can just, you can just, as you walk through the street on a given evening, you can see crimes being committed.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's that obvious.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	You know, walk you know, walk with, you know, with just walk in a confidently,
B:	With a big stick
B:	or.
A:	and, you know, don't, don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are.
B:	Right.
B:	Sure.
B:	Right,
B:	don't, don't walk down a, an alley
B:	or don't get
A:	Yeah.
B:	just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, yeah,
B:	there are times when you can't avoid all that
A:	Uh.
B:	and, and then you're kind of on your own
A:	Yeah.
A:	have you, have you ever, have you ever been mugged in Atlanta?
B:	Uh, no.
B:	The only thing I've ever had, was I've had my wallet lifted
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but that was in a more of a, a setting where there was a number of people around,
B:	and I kind of got,
B:	I was much younger at the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and kind of a couple of people, they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off, so I didn't know who had it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've had that happen,
B:	but that's, that's about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged.
A:	Um.  Yeah,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I think I've only actually seen like one, you know, one actual robbery with a gun
B:	Um.
A:	and that's been about the only, you know, real violent crime where, you know, potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta.
B:	Really,
B:	well, I've had my.
A:	And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've had my car stolen,
B:	so maybe that counts.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, where was, where, where was that?
A:	Was that downtown
A:	or,
B:	Oh no,
B:	that was in the northern um, up near Cumberland Mall area.
A:	Really.
B:	It's actually Cobb County,
B:	but it is Atlanta
A:	Metropolitan,
A:	yeah.
B:	and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've actually, I've known, known some people that have had their cars stolen.
A:	Uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem to, the A P D seems to recover them, you know in various states of disrepair Up on blocks.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah
A:	My friend had a V W Rabbit,
A:	and when he, when he got it back his, um, dashboard was sitting in the front seat
B:	Yeah,
B:	mine was just, it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage,
B:	but they didn't, they didn't strip it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I got it back.
A:	Well, you're probably luckier than.
B:	Yeah,
B:	than most.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, so like does insurance pay for the body damage,
A:	or was that all there was, body.
B:	Right.
B:	It was about three grand to put everything together.
B:	They cracked the steering column of course, to steal the car.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you got to, you crack the steering column
B:	and you pull the,
B:	there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you can start it up, basically pretty easily.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So how do you know this much about, um, stealing cars?
B:	Well, after I found mine I had to, I had this,
A:	So, how you like New Jersey?
B:	Uh, it's pretty good, you know.
B:	You get, uh, closer to the, uh, coast here,
B:	and you do get a good bit of, uh, smog and stuff, especially from all the, uh, fuel cracking towers and chemical plants.
A:	Right,
A:	I guess, uh, I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in, but I guess it's, uh, fairly industrial?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's,
B:	when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial
A:	Right, uh-huh.
B:	but I'm, I'm about, uh, thirty miles west of there
B:	so you have, uh, actually green trees and such that you don't notice that, that other part of New Jersey exists.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	Right.
B:	Actually very,
B:	you know, you go even a few miles out and you got, uh, farms and everything
B:	so you, relatively clear air.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Well, I don't know about you,
A:	but I've always considered automobiles to be, probably the, the prime contributor.
A:	I mean there's a lot of contributors,
A:	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.
B:	Oh, definitely.
B:	It's
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, you know, there are a large number of them on the road.
B:	They're all, you know, going,
B:	and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair.
A:	That's, yeah, that's, that's a big issue is, you know,
A:	a lot of states don't have a, uh, inspection law
A:	so you get, you get a lot of people out there without E T R, emission control systems on their cars and things like that.
B:	Oh, even where you do have the inspections, you know, the inspection is once a year.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's like,
B:	You get the car that's in the accident
B:	and muffler falls off or something
A:	Sure.
B:	and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that.
A:	Right.
A:	I guess, from what I hear, though, uh, next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars.
A:	They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that,
B:	and I think also some of the, uh, car companies are coming out with, uh, gas powered fleets so you,
A:	Yeah.
B:	natural gas powered rather than, uh, gasoline.
A:	Right.
A:	I hope, I, I'm hoping that comes along quick
A:	Uh, I was reading a, an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going
A:	and I guess it's, it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize
A:	and I know that's not due to, uh, it's not due to, to gasoline or to, you know, carbon monoxide so much as the C F C
A:	but,
B:	It, it is coming from cars, though.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I think that's a, that's a contributor definitely.
B:	I mean, the, uh, car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of, uh, the, uh, freon. Which is one of the major fluorocarbons.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess right now what they're, what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and, and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production,
A:	but it,
B:	Well, it, it,
A:	go ahead.
B:	No,
B:	it's, it's the type of thing there that, uh, you know,
B:	the Third World countries are less industrial
B:	and they want to become industrial
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S.
B:	The U S used, you know, all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today.
A:	Right.
A:	And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is, that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if, if that makes any sense.
A:	Uh, in terms of,
B:	Or, or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way, where we got to.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Uh, those of kind of, yeah, those are joining arguments,
A:	but, uh, I don't know,
A:	that's, that's kind of an interesting situation there.
A:	Uh, what they don't realize, those third world countries, what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting.
A:	I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles
A:	and it's, it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it's kind of an interesting situation.
A:	It's not not a real good one actually.
B:	No.
A:	But,
B:	Well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you don't get that, that source of cleansing anymore.
A:	Are, have you been in big cities a long time?
B:	Mostly, I've mostly been in the east coast,
B:	so that's going between Atlanta, D C area,
A:	Okay,
A:	so you've got,
A:	Yeah,
A:	those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard, I would think.
B:	Well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the, uh, major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the  inversion  and Los Angeles and rest of California which is just terrible it sounds.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Denver's definitely
A:	yeah,
A:	that's one of the worst.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Denver's that, that real good that real good, uh, example of sitting in a valley, kind of like Mexico City does, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the, in the world for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I've been pretty lucky,
A:	I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem, although, uh, I'm really kind of based in Orlando, Florida
A:	and there, you can tell that it's getting worse.
A:	I mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver
A:	but you can,
B:	Yeah,
B:	there, it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry, you know, that would be causing it.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And there's not that much in terms of, of public transportation down there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There is,
A:	but it's kind of it's,
A:	what's  your, uh,
B:	Uh.
A:	are you into the Cowboys?
B:	Oh, God, no
B:	Uh, no,
B:	I'm not,
B:	I haven't been,
B:	I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man.
B:	I like Philadelphia Eagles.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that  that's all right.
B:	That's my favorite team,
B:	so.
B:	Uh, now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll be, do a little bit better.
B:	They didn't do too bad last season.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, I hope they can do better.
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	I kind of go back and forth, uh, depending on who's really hot and who's not.
A:	I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, I guess if I have, uh, my druthers, I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks.
B:	Oh,
A:	I kind of like them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's another one of my favorites.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They're kind of,
B:	They're not, they're not my favorite totally.
B:	But I do like them.
B:	I like,
B:	yeah.
B:	Seahawks are good.
B:	They,
B:	now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a little bit for them
B:	but you know, he,
A:	Yeah.
A:	To be honest with you, I, I probably watch, uh, college a little bit more than I do pro.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	I kind of like college actually.
A:	Quite a bit.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's kind of, that's kind of strange.
B:	It's too much running for me in, in college football.
B:	I like  I like the pros.
A:	Is it?
B:	They do, you know,
B:	it's more high tech,
B:	more, you know, players are apt to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That could be.
B:	when you're getting paid millions to do it, you I think they take it to another level.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I can see it's more, you know, grunted out, run the ball type.
B:	College football is a little bit different
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.
B:	who's that?
B:	Notre Dame
A:	No.
A:	I root for Nebraska quite a bit.
B:	Nebraska
B:	Yeah
B:	there's a running team.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That, that, that's boring for me.
B:	I, I'll take the passing teams any day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Well, I can see, I can see definitely how you get into that.
A:	I, to be honest with you, I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well
A:	and.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, it's four yards, three yards eight yards, tackle.
A:	Right.
B:	That's, you know, it gets kind of monotonous.
B:	After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just, just to  juice it up a little bit
A:	Sure.
B:	and but,
A:	Well, I think they're starting to realize that.
A:	A lot of the, like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's high dollar.
B:	You know, it's all, it's all money now.
B:	Even college is all  can we get on T V
A:	Right.
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's, that's,
A:	So, uh, what's
A:	this World League is coming in?
A:	Uh, that's getting ready to start up, right?
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Have you followed that very much
A:	or,
B:	Uh, not really.
B:	I, I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.
B:	I think it's basically, you know, it's, it's an institution.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball.
B:	It's just, I just, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, it, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.
B:	But it's never going to be the next,
A:	Right.
A:	It can take over a small market share
A:	but nothing really,
B:	Yeah.
B:	it's going to take a little bit.
B:	Some people are going to watch it
B:	but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	It's just, it's never going to reach that, that standard
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think I agree with you.
A:	It's, it's kind of interesting to see, uh, to see their claim of, you know, like world football.
A:	But, when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	It's kind of, it's kind of strange.
B:	Uh, I guess we're the only ones, who take it that far.
B:	Everybody else still nuts over soccer
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Actually, uh, I kind of like soccer.
A:	I've  never really played it
B:	Yeah?
A:	but, uh, I like the idea.
A:	It's, it's an interesting game to watch.
A:	That and rugby.
A:	I've like to watch, rugby every now and then.
B:	Yeah
B:	or Australian rules football.
B:	That's,
A:	Yeah,
A:	whatever you want to call it there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's some brutal stuff there.
B:	That's, that's worse than football as far as violence I think.
B:	Golly.
B:	Those guys kill each other out there.
B:	Rugby is something else.
A:	Yeah, .
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's just wild.
B:	That's why it's a a big college thing.
A:	Yeah
B:	Rugby is definitely big in college
B:	because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
A:	Right,
A:	exactly
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	I could see the feel for that.
B:	But it's, it's pretty, it's fun to play.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'll give it that.
B:	It is fun to play. If you don't value your *listen--missing a word? very much.
A:	You've played it then?
B:	But, you know, I don't think rugby will ever be professional
B:	but  it, it's, it's,
A:	No I doubt it, you know.
A:	Not, at  least not in this country anyway.
B:	No.
B:	You can't stay healthy and do that.
B:	That's a rough game.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is.
B:	But, uh, I don't know.
B:	I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year.
B:	So you,
B:	the, the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team.
A:	They really are.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My, my, it's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here, he's, uh, he's lived in Pennock, Minnesota. *two utts?
B:	Do you know where that is?
A:	Uh, no
A:	I don't.
A:	To tell you the truth, I'm,
B:	It, it's a small town.
B:	It's about two hours,
B:	it's in like central Minnesota.
B:	It's a couple of hours, uh, west of Minneapolis.
A:	Okay.
B:	But, uh,
A:	To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.
B:	You just live there now.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm up here for a year on an internship.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well he's,
A:	But I, I actually live in Florida.
B:	Live in Florida.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Like the Seahawks
A:	Well, you know, I  I mean, who, who   who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right
B:	Hey, I, I  I've only been to Philadelphia twice
B:	and I, you know, I, I still like,
B:	Really,
B:	really.
A:	I mean, I guess I could go for Miami
A:	but I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but.
A:	I'm from,
A:	I root for Nebraska
A:	so I'm, I don't have a real love for Miami anyway.
A:	But, I don't know,
A:	I, I guess, I get, into pretty much,
A:	What do you think?
B:	Well, uh, I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago, uh, because I'm not that old yet.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um
A:	I can be,
A:	but go ahead
B:	Uh, I know that, uh,
B:	I mean obviously you look at, at the technological aspect of, of social change.
B:	I mean you didn't have, uh, you didn't have video games.
B:	You didn't have home computers.
B:	You didn't have Xerox machines.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, uh, you, you try to,
B:	you go into a, a business today
B:	and, you, you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper
B:	and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and, and everything have become such, you know, such a, a a part of the way we live.
A:	Right.
A:	We fax  everything.
B:	And ,
B:	Yeah.
A:	We don't even wait for the mail anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah, uh,
B:	a business associate of mine was, was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
B:	and you had to do something,
B:	this was concerning the S E C,
B:	and so if they had business to do, they had to finish it, you know, three days in advance so they could get it through the mail. Because you can get it there, you know *"Because" as connector; sd in, in a matter of minutes you know, through a fax machine
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Right.
B:	and because of that, these quote, unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder.
A:	Right.
B:	Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute.
A:	You're expected to,
A:	exactly.
A:	And I recently read an article on just this, that said stress today is so much worse
A:	It should be less because we have a microwave
A:	and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
A:	and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes
A:	but the more conveniences we have, the more that's expected of us
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we have no down time.
A:	Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So we keep moving.
A:	We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen.
A:	We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing.
A:	So we have no relaxation time in between
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to, to deal with that and get your, your time in between things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that's good.
A:	That's an interesting point.
A:	But I just think our, our family lives have changed drastically.
A:	And I think that's
A:	of course a part of it is technology.
A:	I mean our kids, where would they be without Nintendo and, you know, their T V shows
A:	and
A:	some of that is really bad I think.
A:	But, we have all single families.
A:	So many single families now.
A:	Uh, a lot of working,
A:	both parents are working.
A:	So there's a whole big effect on our kids
A:	and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father.
A:	You know, I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years.
B:	Well, there's that
B:	and there's the fact that, you know, nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen.
B:	I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we, have continuation, large scale immigration into the country.
A:	You're probably right
A:	And I'm an O B nurse
A:	and that's never really occurred to me but that's, that's interesting.
A:	I never really thought about it that way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I saw that, the numbers on that awhile back
B:	and I was like, uh-huh
B:	so
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	When is this good or not good. *listen
B:	Well, uh, In terms of the long term effect, effect on, on America, in terms of the culture and everything, I don't know.
A:	We don't know that yet
B:	Uh,  Most of the, of the next generation is going to be in, or, or an, extremely large part of the next generation is going to be, you know, second generation, uh, from immigrant parents.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know either.
A:	That's true.
B:	And they're going to be really struggling
B:	and I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	I mean, it's no longer the, the, uh, the accomplishment that it, that it once was
B:	and not that many people are really trying I don't think
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's kind of scary.
A:	Huh. Well that's true.
A:	But, I,
A:	it's just very, very different
A:	and I guess every ten years it's just been very different.
B:	Yeah
A:	So. And I don't know what's going to happen.
A:	Uh, I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life  so that they're establishing careers
B:	Yeah,
A:	and they've got their homes
A:	and they've got,
A:	Okay Randall, uh, uh,
A:	do you have any special interest in, uh, space flight?
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Ever since I was a young and, uh, used to watch the old, uh, Apollo missions going off in, uh, classroom T V
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh, I suspect a lot of people, uh, uh, got, uh, turned on by watching, watching those go off.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, very exciting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The, uh, uh,
B:	I've I've always, uh, wanted very much, uh, to, uh, be somehow involved in all that. And, uh, to, uh, meet and, and to see, see it actually happen.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course, I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, that seems rather unlikely at this point, unfortunately.
A:	What do you do now?
B:	Uh, computer programmer
A:	Oh.
B:	Unfortunately, that can be done from the ground
A:	it is.
B:	Maybe that's why they're so slow.
B:	I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it looks really potent stuff.
B:	Yeah
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, it's, yeah, I think it's the greatest stuff in the world, though.
A:	It's, jeez,
A:	they, I make all kinds of things with it.
A:	We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers.
A:	I, I almost want to start a business doing it,
A:	but I don't, I, I'm so, uh, timid when it comes to starting a business.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's a big step,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is, especially with the, being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end.
B:	Yeah, uh,
A:	You know, after a while you make some stuff,
A:	then you start looking at it,
A:	go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly
A:	But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby.
A:	Um, he does it, believe it or not, I wouldn't imagine why, but to get out of the house, away from his wife,
A:	because he's a seasonal worker,
A:	he works in the construction.
A:	And up here it's almost a pattern,
A:	and you see your fathers do it,
A:	then their sons do it.
A:	What they do is they work construction,
A:	then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter.
A:	And, uh, this guy was going nuts,
A:	and his, uh, son built him a garage and got him some, uh, oh, I don't know what the equipment's called, but planers and things and set him up,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	shapers and planers and routers.
A:	and he makes, all kinds of furniture for, um, his kids,
A:	and he makes, uh, uh, like little kids' furniture.
A:	He gets right into it
A:	and, uh,
B:	There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little, little companies of one and two guys, you know, up there,
B:	this particular one, I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire, where out in the, just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in,
B:	they may be the same kind of people you're talking about.
B:	You know, they've, they've got twelve weeks to do something,
B:	and they, they're making furniture and just, you know, things like that during the winter
B:	and then they go off and do other things during the summer.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a, it's a really, good thing because it's keeping him sane,
B:	So, yeah,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and plus it's keeping his marriage
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, and, and plus he's getting on in his years now.
A:	He's, he's not that old,
A:	but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost, to, to do something like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, it's really, it's, it's, uh, hard work.
A:	I couldn't imagine taking lumber, raw lumber and trying to make something out of it.
A:	He He dowels everything.
B:	That would be really you know,
B:	like say the,
B:	Oh, man,
B:	yeah.
A:	And it's all got to line up.
A:	It's,
A:	and, uh, I don't think he goofs too much,
A:	I don't to, see too much scrap around.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, that's something.
B:	Now our temperatures down here, we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties
A:	God , I'm envious
B:	and, uh, so, and, uh, so as far as, you know, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight I just got through, I was planting some, some trees out back tonight,
B:	and, uh, this is, uh, it's really nice, out tonight.
A:	Is it going to be, Is it going to be really dry?
B:	Almost hated to come, you know.
A:	Uh, are you are you,
A:	now I always plant trees in the fall.
A:	I don't know why
A:	so the, the cold weather can kill them
B:	Yeah,
B:	these were, uh, trees that, that wintered.
A:	but I guess,
B:	I don't know where they came from.
B:	They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that.
B:	And they come down here
B:	and they'll sit in the nurseries here
B:	and they'll go ahead and, and, uh, leaf out.
B:	So what I'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's, or trees that are already leafed out.
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	I guess they, they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all .
B:	Yeah.
B:	Mostly, I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall,
B:	let them winter you know, through the fall,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, down here, well, it's done both ways.
B:	It, it just kind of depends on what you're, what you're planting,
B:	but, uh all the shrubs and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, when you have time to do it
B:	Yeah.
A:	My sister does, uh, flower gardens.
A:	She gets right into it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She spends lots of money on them.
A:	And I guess a lot of people do, do do that.
A:	They landscape their whole house with flower gardens.
B:	Yeah .
A:	She's got like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn
B:	Yeah.
B:	Flowers, during the summer down here, the, the normal kind of flowers, there's very few of them that will really do well.
B:	Everything does real well here in the spring until about, oh, first part of June
B:	and then the the heat sets in.
A:	It gets,
B:	And June, July, August are, you know,
B:	most of the, those kind of plants just, are just barely staying alive, let alone make flowers.
A:	Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house
A:	or is it,
B:	Uh, we're in a relatively new area.
B:	We're kind of out of, uh, the natural tree area.
B:	We're kind of up on a, on a higher, on a slope.
A:	So you don't have a lot of tree coverage?
B:	So we don't have,
B:	where we are right now there are very few trees.
A:	Because going to make,
B:	This was, this was, this was pasture land,
B:	but down the, down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are, look like jungles, you know.
B:	They're really,
A:	Yeah.
A:	See, um, uh, where my, uh, well, my grandmother passed away, but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they just shade everything.
B:	Now where is this?
A:	Uh, it's in Georgia.
B:	In Georgia,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's, yeah, it's right outside of Macon,
A:	and, and it's just a,
A:	I like the way that, I like the way that idea of the south is,
A:	but when I think of Texas, I think of nothing but, no trees and just grass
B:	Well, I tell you what,
B:	now, see, East Texas,
B:	there's two parts of Texas, East Texas and North Texas.
B:	Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way, weather and everything.
A:	Yeah.
B:	The two cities are very, very identical,
B:	so if you were familiar with Atlanta, uh,
A:	So it's that dry heat?
B:	Uh, well, no,
B:	it's, it's, uh, not dry at all.
B:	It, it's humid.
A:	Well, where is it,
A:	is it wasn't it Houston's humid?
B:	Houston is awful
A:	Yeah.
B:	Houston is really humid.
B:	No,
A:	It's humid.
A:	Well, ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle.
B:	Gosh.
A:	Yeah
A:	so,
B:	Exercise is not supposed to do that to you.
A:	That's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way, you know, down the hallway.
A:	Do you do anything on a regular basis?
B:	Well, off and on,
B:	off and on.
B:	Right now I've been off
B:	but, I've been going over to the fitness center.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, My husband's a T I in the unit here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	three times,
B:	Well I try to go over there at least three times a week,
B:	and I try to walk, um, at least five times a week.
A:	Do you, when you go to the ,
A:	I have to ask you,
A:	and if this is getting to ,
A:	we're not supposed to get too particular,
A:	but I'm just curious,
A:	when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged, either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek, in terms of, there's so much, it's so much of a weight orientation, weight lifting, et cetera.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, well, I've been going to Spring Creek.
B:	I haven't been to the Dallas one now in, oh, a couple of years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	At least since they've redone it, supposedly redone.
B:	So I don't really,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's not that great,
A:	and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off.
A:	But my husband's working over there
A:	and he just goes to the Dallas one.
A:	But I just don't,
A:	I mean, it's just so much weight lifting.
A:	Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	Or is that what your into
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	No,
B:	well, I've used the Nautilus equipment. And the bikes, and stair climbers, and stuff like that mostly.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't use the free weights
B:	but,
A:	I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like those too.
A:	And the pool when it gets warmer.
B:	And the pool,
B:	yeah.
B:	That's great.
A:	Yeah
A:	I know.
A:	Well, what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas,
A:	and long story short, I hadn't,
A:	this is really a stupid thing that happened,
A:	but they have like the gymnasium flooring
A:	and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand in any class like that I go to.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Instead of having that level, you know they had a chrome strip that wasn't level,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was about four inches deep and then about, oh a seventy degree angle.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it.
B:	Um.
A:	The orthopedist called it a, uh, basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you, and it snapped.
B:	Woo.
A:	I know.
A:	We went to , well whatever in Plano,
A:	and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
A:	And the doctor said, you didn't do anything.
A:	There's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you.
A:	That was Tuesday night,
A:	and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work
A:	and, uh, I was on crutches,
A:	and he said, I think you better call an orthopedist.
A:	So we went to one
A:	and he just put a big old cast on it.
B:	Put a big cast on it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	for about four weeks.
B:	Four weeks,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, I like aerobics,
A:	but I'm not so sure that,
B:	Well not that much, though.
A:	No,
A:	I've never,
A:	I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery I'd had,
A:	but I've never, I'd, you know, I was pretty much in shape walking
A:	and, and, you know, this is one of those things,
A:	like this orthopedist said, he said you'd be surprised how many how many people come in here with things like that because they are active.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I was real embarrassed,
A:	but I felt kind of stupid
B:	Well, those things happen, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they do.
A:	I mean, I guess I'm glad, you know, that, um, nobody really noticed,
A:	I guess you could say.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because I got up and started jumping on it again.
B:	Well that did a lot of good,
B:	I'm sure.
A:	Yeah
A:	really.
A:	I enjoy aerobics,
A:	and I do it because I like it,
A:	I mean, I like the music and that kind of stuff.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I like the music,
B:	but I've been unable to do that, because I hurt my foot about five years ago.
B:	I broke my heel. No,
A:	Oh
A:	that makes my foot,
A:	how'd you do that?
A:	In aerobics?
B:	no,
B:	actually I was up on a ladder, and, uh, fell off. Leaned the wrong way.
A:	Oh goodness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot, but on concrete.
A:	What'd they do for that?
A:	Did they have to cast it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they had, well they had to go in and do surgery.
B:	They put a pin in it.
A:	Oh, so the aerobics, the impact, would not be good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	as I permanently damaged the, the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there.
A:	Oh, goodness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt.
A:	Oh, that makes sense.
A:	So, I mean, are you, in terms of other things, like, like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis, or can you not do stuff like that at all?
B:	Uh, well I haven't tried that.
B:	I don't know.
B:	It's been I bet it's been thirty years since I played tennis.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's been,
B:	Mostly into just walking and stuff like that.
A:	That's probably the safer way
A:	because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro, coronary.
B:	Yeah
A:	And there was my ego when I went ahead
A:	and I went, oh, I can do that
A:	and half the time though I don't jump half as much as,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, like, I'm real tall,
A:	and, you know, I'm not heavy,
A:	but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height, um, I'm five eleven you need just take it easy.
B:	Um.
B:	Sure.
A:	Um, but when I see some
A:	I mean, and I just don't think it's healthy
A:	all that pounding all the time.
B:	It isn't, really, it's not really good for your knees.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	that's the other reason,
A:	and, I don't know,
A:	this was just, I guess, something freak that happened to me,
A:	because I wasn't familiar with the,
B:	Well, the floor was uneven.
A:	Oh, it was completely,
A:	I mean, it literally,
A:	the two dissimilar floor floor coverings were not level.
A:	And at first after it happened I thought, maybe that's a handicap access,
A:	and then I said no,
A:	that's just the way it's constructed.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And my husband being a T I engineer,
A:	I said a few things to him when I got home,
A:	I said, who has engineered that?
B:	Really
A:	But I,
A:	sounds you, like
A:	one thing that I like, like swimming, you like that a lot?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I like swimming.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to?
B:	No,
B:	I like, I liked it because I want to,
B:	it makes me feel better.
A:	That's how I am.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's real funny because if you, you know,
B:	it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired,
B:	but it's the other way around.
A:	Right.
A:	It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff.
B:	Yeah
B:	really.
A:	Yeah
A:	but,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I need all the help I can get.
A:	That gravity factor,
A:	I know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It does get you.
A:	Like that orthopedist said to me, he said, don't worry Diane,
A:	he says, he said, uh, you're at thirty something,
A:	but you're on the upper side.
A:	He said that, don't worry,
A:	he says, even if you weren't doing anything your body would start, that would start to happen to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	thanks a lot.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because I was saying to him, I said, I'm not that heavy,
A:	I'm not heavy, you know,
A:	maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I said, uh, why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more.
A:	And he goes, human nature
A:	And then, you know, you see these little girls in these little bitty things,
A:	and they're all like twenty-one years of age
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele.
B:	That's true,
B:	they do.
A:	Except for the guys that lift the weights.
A:	They do intimidate.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I try to go real late or real early before they get there
A:	Yeah.
A:	There some things I'd like to try,
A:	but, you know, sometime when I ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well that's one thing I like about the Spring Creek place.
B:	At least the fellow that's there, one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And his name is B J.
A:	I don't think I've ever, I think I've,
A:	there was some girl there.
A:	I've been there like, maybe a dozen times.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's terrible.
A:	I don't know if the Dallas location,
A:	it just seems that,
A:	um, sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles bar
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	And I haven't noticed that up at Spring Creek.
A:	No,
A:	I haven't either,
A:	and I just, uh,
A:	it's not that far of a drive
A:	and I'm glad they did that.
A:	Um, you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site.
A:	It's not at all anything worth talking about.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I thought maybe one of these days I'll drive over there and check it out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but if you don't live near there that's not worth,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I live in Richardson,
B:	but it's about half way between the Spring Creek and the, the Dallas site.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's actually where this happened to me, out in, I say Plano,
A:	but it's all the same to me.
A:	Richardson, over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a new recreation center.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.
A:	walked out,
A:	I was one thing,
A:	oh great, I have purple tights on, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they're going yes.
A:	But in general I like to I, I like dance a lot,
A:	so I mean aerobics is something I'd hate to give up.
A:	But he, he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot,
A:	but he just said to me, maybe you ought to try bicycling
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	you probably will for a while, because it's going to be real tender.
A:	He told me eight to twelve weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not anything, you know.
A:	I said, but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks.
A:	He said, yeah,
A:	but that's just,
A:	they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker, because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm.
A:	But I just,
A:	the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed,
A:	I couldn't, you know adjust that.
B:	I know what you mean.
A:	You know more about this stuff than I do, obviously then,
B:	Not fun
A:	No.
A:	Well, you're walking okay now obviously,
A:	and you can,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I have a slight limp from it,
B:	but it matches one if I have one on the other side.
B:	Yeah
A:	Well, anything else about exercise we can talk about.
B:	Well, other than I need to go.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too,
A:	me too.
A:	I need to go actually get something to eat here.
B:	It's great though,
B:	I really do enjoy it.
A:	Okay,
A:	thank you, Sandy.
B:	Sure,
B:	thanks.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	I don't know, um,
A:	do you do a lot of camping?
B:	Well, my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping,
B:	we, but we bought a van last year,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we were hoping, uh, to do some camping in the van, um,
B:	we did go camping in not Arkansas, Oklahoma.
B:	Uh, last year in, we camped in a tent,
B:	and, uh, there were two other couples with us
B:	and there was, uh, state park.
A:	Oh, so ,
B:	And it was really nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, up here some of the state parks are really nice
A:	and some of them aren't,
A:	some of them are pretty rough.
B:	Really?
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	they, they just have like outhouses,
A:	they don't have like a shower room or anything,
A:	yeah ,
A:	but some of them are really nice
A:	they have showers and full bathrooms,
B:	Um.
A:	um, but I don't know,
A:	I, I've been camping a couple times
A:	but I'm not a real avid camper, uh,
A:	a lot of people I know are,
A:	but, um, I don't, I don't .
B:	I, I don't like really camping in the rough.
B:	I like the, the, the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we went, we went once to a lean-to
A:	and it, um,
A:	I mean, there wasn't any electricity on the camp site
A:	but it was all right,
A:	we only spent two nights there.
A:	I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights.
A:	I wouldn't want to go for like a week,
A:	but, um, two nights is good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that would, that would be much.
A:	Um, especially there was a little store close by,
A:	so, it was pretty nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the campsite that we went to was an area that,
B:	it's right on a big lake,
B:	and there's a lot of boating out there,
B:	and we, we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit
B:	but it was still, uh, it was still, too, cold.
A:	Oh, really?
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it was pretty early in the year.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	up here you got to wait until, August, until the water warms up .
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's not that bad
A:	but it's still pretty chilly.
A:	Um, I don't know,
A:	I was, I have a tent
A:	and I fluff out in it, in the backyard and stuff,
A:	but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
A:	and another thing is the thing seems to get,
A:	it's dirty you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, you can't keep the dirt out of the tent.
A:	I don't know
A:	we have a seven year old,
A:	it's pretty funny,
A:	like stay out.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we have, we have a dog
B:	and that's just about as bad as a kid
A:	Yeah,
A:	boy, he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times . And use it as a play, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they like to play in them.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't know how you can really keep, uh, the inside of a tent clean.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know .
B:	Other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt out of it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, what we were doing, we were just going to say, we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, you know, no going in and out, and, or what he wants to do,
A:	we had brought his friend along, was play in the tent.
A:	It was like, no, this is not working,
A:	you can't do that,
A:	you get the tent all dirty.
B:	Did,
A:	Plus you get it all wet,
A:	we were at a beach site, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, did you have another, a big tent, like uh, um, like a, looks like a sitting area type, you know, like a two room type ?
A:	No,
A:	but, you know, I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice
A:	and, um, up here we have, uh, we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	we don't really have a problem with that, um, in these areas, um,
B:	and even, even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs.
B:	And I noticed that,
B:	I know that I said, that's,
B:	I've, I've lived back east before, um, they,
A:	They're terrible,
A:	they're really terrible.
A:	Uh, but, there's this one campsite, that it,
A:	just some of them are known
A:	but there is one that's out in this big lake
A:	and its, its, its, mosquitoes are terrible
A:	and then there's this, there's this other one that's more up in the mountains
A:	but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
A:	and there's no bugs,
A:	that's the whole thing that everyone told me, oh,
A:	I'm, I was going to go to, Little River State Park,
A:	that place is great,
A:	there's no bugs.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, oh,
A:	okay,
A:	because, uh, we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas,
A:	we were really affected bad by it , but really got it, um,
A:	almost destroyed the the tourism in one town, because of the mosquitoes,
A:	they're so, bad.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was, it's a really nice area,
A:	I've been there before
A:	and it's,
A:	I, I couldn't imagine living just sixty miles north of them
A:	but they were plagued, they were plagued with them, with mosquitoes.
A:	And you can go out, outside in the daytime, all right,
A:	but the minute the sun went down, um, that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out.
B:	Huh.
A:	I mean, just the very second,
A:	it's really strange.
A:	They, uh, they must, uh, work on that, you know,
A:	the, it gets cooler when the sun sets
A:	and then they all come out.
B:	Well, have you ever, have you ever taken any of those, um, what do they call this, lights,
B:	have you ever used those?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I never really noticed how effective they were,
A:	but, um, because that wasn't really,
A:	I bought them,
A:	I really didn't get to use them like, oh, there's mosquitoes let's turn them.
A:	We just sort of lit them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes,
A:	so, we didn't really contribute it to that.
A:	But, um, I think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes,
A:	I can't see all this little, uh, smoke buckets I call them,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they work,
A:	but they're suppose to work really well.
B:	Huh.
A:	Oh, I'm in my paperwork here,
A:	that's what I do when I wait for a phone call,
A:	I get in my paperwork Oh, to find my most important parts.
A:	But I don't know, I don't know if I'm going to go,
A:	I wish was an avid camper
A:	and I could really talk about like gardening or something,
A:	you can talk about that a lot,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, I do want to go again.
A:	We just moved to a new into a house,
A:	so, I don't think camping,
A:	maybe in the backyard,
A:	but I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'd, I'd like to go camping cross-country, um,
B:	I just got married less than two years ago,
B:	so, we don't have any, any children yet, um,
A:	So, it's easy for you to go.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, easy to pick up and go, and,
B:	we have a van
B:	and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it.
A:	Um, oh, God
B:	So, it's not really, I guess, camping the way most people picture camping in the tent
B:	but,
A:	I don't know
A:	but that sounds that my, my kind of camping, it really does.
A:	Yeah,
A:	okay, um, well, um,
A:	that is is to have a, a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it, plus your tent.
B:	Yeah,
B:	or, or get,
B:	my brother has a real nice pop-up.
A:	Yep.
B:	And he just, he just tows it behind his truck.
A:	Um,
B:	And he, he's got three kids,
B:	so, his kids will sleep in the truck, in the, in the back of the bed.
B:	Um, and they sleep in the pop-up.
A:	Well, those, they're kind of nice
A:	but they're also, um, flimsy when you really look at them.
A:	But when you get inside they're really nice, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	everything's really,
A:	but then when you look underneath them, it's just got these little wheels and this little axle,
A:	it's like, oh, my
A:	and then a big windstorm it would pick you up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he did have a problem, uh, when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend, Oklahoma, um,
B:	a, a storm came in
B:	and it started raining really heavy
B:	and they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite,
B:	everybody was getting stuck in the mud.
A:	Oh, jeez,
B:	And, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	what do you, what do you do when you get a, I mean, like a really violent storm like a tornado,
A:	just stay in your truck.
A:	I mean, I wouldn't stay in the, um,
B:	Well, theirs was so bad,
B:	and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up,
A:	Oh.
B:	and they had to get out of there.
A:	So, then, were they successful?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, yeah, they were.
A:	But it took them a little while?
B:	But, yeah,
B:	they they decided that, that was enough camping for the weekend.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, did they get stuck?
B:	No,
B:	they ended up getting out.
B:	They ended up helping several other people though that were, that were stuck.
A:	Yeah, huh.
A:	Well, so, they evacuated it
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they, the whole, the whole campsite was evacuated.
A:	Wow.
B:	I mean some, I think some people that had fairly sturdy, um, vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, I think they stayed.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But everybody that was real close to the water ended up,
B:	it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream.
A:	I know I always I like to get right on the water,
A:	yeah,
A:	by the campsite, it's so,
B:	Yeah.
A:	we have lean-tos up here.
A:	I really like them,
A:	like I say, they're kind of, just kind of more sturdy than anything, you know,
A:	just, just,
B:	They have them right at the campsites?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're, they're lean-tos. Yeah, they're pretty nice,
B:	Wow.
A:	they're, they're, uh, it's like a little house except the whole face is open,
A:	and the one time that we went, we got one,
A:	it was overlooking the water
A:	but it was a big embankment,
A:	I wanted to get one right on the water.
A:	we had an electrical storm too,
A:	and it was really, it was neat sitting there watching it,
A:	I mean, it was raining,
A:	when we called home, everybody said, oh, we were worried about you in that storm ...
A:	All right,
A:	well I have a lot of different teams that I like to, to keep in touch with,
A:	of course, Texas Rangers being one of them,
A:	I mean, uh, you know, you can't live in Dallas without, you know,
B:	Well what are the others?
A:	Well, uh, I originally came from Saint Louis,
A:	so, uh, the Saint Louis Cardinals are one, uh,
A:	I moved to Kansas City,
A:	see I have, I have a tendency to, a, adopt teams when I go to a uh, go to a town.
B:	Well it's helpful.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, uh, I lived in Kansas City for a couple years
A:	and I adopted the Royals,
A:	I lived in Houston for two and a half years
A:	so I adopted the, uh, uh, the Houston Astros,
A:	so I mean, you know, I've got quite a few.
B:	Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff?
A:	No,
A:	I don't, I don't get into that too much,
A:	every once in a while, I will keep in, in touch, with maybe, like who's in the top five of hitting, or something like that
A:	but I don't get into, you know, how many errors somebody has or things like that.
B:	Well there's, there's a guy on, that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does, uh, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's essentially trivial statistics
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they've got a
B:	it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games.
A:	I've heard of that one.
B:	And apparently the Rangers last year, won a lot of one run games.
A:	Well I didn't know that,
A:	that's supposed to be a real good statistic, uh.
B:	Well, it, it, it is
B:	but it's the, it's, it's a reverse indicator.
A:	Well that's true,
A:	they don't have the offense to, uh, to get out, or to have the, the more runs,
A:	so.
B:	Well what the, what the argument is
B:	and it, it, it, it's one of these statistical,
B:	gee, how can you draw a conclusion from it,
B:	but they find that, there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's strangely enough, it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year.
A:	Huh.
B:	Which means that if you have a good year winning one one run games that the following year, you'll have a bad year.
B:	And they, they've got, um, they've looked at I think twenty-three teams, uh,
B:	and, and, the, uh, statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three.
B:	It was,
B:	which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year,
B:	I, uh,
A:	Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway, to tell you the truth.
B:	Well, I mean, and it's, uh, uh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	what do you, what do you think of Incaviglia's loss.
A:	I kind of think it was necessary,
A:	I mean, I, I don't, I'm not a, a big, um, pure power hitter anyway.
A:	I mean, I don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time.
A:	I mean, uh, I think that, uh, that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it,
A:	but when you get two strikes on you, you have a you know, you should, you know, shorten your swing a little bit, you know,
A:	if it's a perfect shot, go for it,
A:	but I mean, you know, the strike outs were a big problem for him,
A:	and, uh, plus supposedly what I heard, he was not much of a team player anyway,
A:	so.
B:	Well it, it's an interesting concept, though, when you look at, uh, of, of how baseball, how apparently,
B:	I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him.
B:	And, uh, and the point of, of, I guess,
B:	I don't understand the, the strategy of how baseball works,
B:	but it seems that, you know, they can sign him tomorrow,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he could go in the team the next day,
B:	and, and, and they put him in the lineup
B:	and he hits a home run
B:	and all of a sudden he becomes a hero.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's true.
B:	And, and all he has to do is hit the ball,
B:	I mean, you're not,
B:	and all he has to do is one, you know, hit it once.
B:	It doesn't,
B:	he can, he can he can swing a couple times,
B:	if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can.
A:	Right.
B:	It's an interesting, uh, an interesting concept of, of how they do it.
B:	But I agree with you
B:	I think that, I think that's part of what, uh, baseball needs more of.
B:	I, uh, I, I guess what bothers me is, is that when you go, um, you wait and wait and wait
B:	and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
B:	and that's all the game is.
B:	I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well there's, there's another point to that too.
A:	They said the, that um, that he was horrible at, uh, at batting with, with men on base.
A:	Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you, you know, gives you run, obviously.
B:	Yes.
A:	But I mean if you can't do it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong, um, you know,
A:	you, you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs, you know, to, to be able to, uh, score enough runs to be able to win in these, uh, in this day and age,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well how do you think the Royals are going to do?
A:	I think the Royals will do okay.
A:	They have, they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
A:	and they are, they're these, uh, cycle pitchers,
A:	they, they pitch one year bad, one year good, one beer bad, one year good.
A:	Saberhagen has won, uh, supposedly the Cy,
A:	I think he won Cy year, uh, two out of three years,
A:	and, uh, you know, so he's very much due for a good year.
B:	Well are they going to beat, are they going to beat Oakland?
A:	Well now see that's a good question,
A:	I, that's, I don't know how Oakland's going to react to being, uh, swept in the World Series last year.
A:	They could very easily, uh, take that as a challenge. Which is the way most teams you know, naturally do. Uh, and, and, just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so,
B:	Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time
B:	and I watch, I, I watch their sports up there
B:	and they're, uh, they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	baseball is their, is their life up there like football is down here I think.
B:	did you actually live in Saint Louis?
A:	I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis,
A:	yeah.
B:	everybody does, right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true too,
A:	I think that's all that they have.
B:	I had a friend from college that lives in, uh,
B:	it's well, I should say on the west side,
B:	I mean everything's on the west side.
B:	Manchester?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, out that way,
A:	Um.
B:	and I went and visited him,
B:	but anyway, it is interesting.
B:	Well how are the Cardinals?
B:	Do you still keep up with them, or
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh yeah,
A:	I, I definitely do,
A:	in fact I've got family that still lives up there.
A:	Um, from what I hear from everybody up there, they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go.
A:	But I've been following Spring training
A:	and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.
B:	Well is that a good indicator?
A:	That, well it can be.
A:	It, it really kind of depends on, on, um, what they were, you know, what they were looking for.
A:	In other words, if, if in Spring training they were looking at all their kids, like a lot of them do, um, then it really doesn't give you any indication.
A:	But if they were, uh, playing the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good indication,
A:	so, you know, it's, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just, you know, come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring training and then gone on a, you know, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
A:	so,
B:	You know what I think is remarkable is, uh,
B:	it seems that what you really need to do to win though, is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have, have, have real breakthrough years.
A:	Exactly,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, and the question is how do you forecast that,
A:	You can't.
B:	if you had to, if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series, I mean it would be really tough.
A:	Right,
A:	I think the best thing that you can do is go with, um, the players that are, that have the talent to do the best years. And, um, that they hadn't had these, uh, gigantic, uh, career years yet and, and just kind of assume that, you know, one of them is going to break through eventually,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so. And I, I think they said the Reds, um,
A:	this last year, I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, and, and so they may be even better this year.
B:	Well, well when are the Rangers going to come through
A:	Uh, that's a good question.
A:	I,
A:	the Rangers have a, have a pitching problem
A:	and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question.
A:	They're doing the right thing, though, uh,
A:	they are going with their farm system.
A:	They're letting their farm system, uh, build up and stuff like that
A:	and,
B:	Well is there enough money,
B:	that's part of it,
B:	I, uh,
B:	that was part of Skip Bayless' argument.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know if you read Skip Bayless, but a, a local commentary
A:	No.
B:	and, his argument is that uh, the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to, to bring in the big dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, that's probably true.
B:	Would you, would you agree with that?
A:	Well considering what I've seen in the last, uh, you know, two seasons, I'm beginning to agree with that,
A:	yeah.
A:	But I mean, you don't have to spend the big money, as far as I'm concerned to, uh, to win.
A:	You just have to spend it if it's necessary.
B:	Uh.
A:	In other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team, then keep him there.
A:	Don't let him go away.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I think that's really what's been hurting, uh, the, uh, Rangers.
B:	Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff .
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	they, they spent more money, last year than any other team in the, in the league
A:	and they were, you know, toward the bottom of the league.
A:	Uh, so it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you, uh, winning a pennant.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It really doesn't,
A:	so.
B:	Well and that, I think that's maybe part of it that, that the, um,
B:	and it, you know,
B:	if I owned the team. I think you'd like them to do well
B:	but the question of losing big, big money that what, did, did, did Steinbrenner actually make money on the,
A:	Uh, you got me.
A:	I, you know, I think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go
A:	and once you do that, you lose everything,
A:	I mean.
B:	Well it's, it, it, yeah, it's a little bit like any other sport, you know.
B:	When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, I mean, I, I guess as we get older, you're probably going,
B:	if, if you, if you compare to go to a, a sport, a, a
B:	say you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	if, you know,
B:	but how, how often do you do that.
A:	Right.
B:	An
B:	I, I, I would, I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there, you know, several times a,
A:	That, that's the whole point.
A:	There are so many games in, in a year that they've got to have repeat customers.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They can't afford not to,
A:	and, you know, that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done, um,
A:	I mean,
A:	their, you know, their ticket prices are, you know, I guess as high as anybody else's
A:	but what, somehow or another they, attract, uh, so many people from,
A:	I mean they're a, it's a small market
A:	and yet they attract as many if not more than most, uh, uh, most, other cities,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but don't you think there's a, there, there are older fans there.
B:	I, I don't mean older, um, you know,
B:	the fact that, that it's, it's a better established and that the, the city is, is, is more, of a ...
A:	Okay, um,
A:	what baseball team are you familiar with?
B:	Well, I'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while,
A:	Really?
B:	and, um, and that's,
A:	Oh, now come on,
A:	no Texas Rangers?
B:	after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.
A:	Really?
A:	I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later
A:	but, um, I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers.
A:	I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground
A:	and that, um,
A:	yeah ,
A:	I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system,
A:	and, uh, the radio's kind of cruel,
A:	I mean, think, the, he, this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground,
A:	I mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man.
A:	I don't care if you're President.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far
B:	I couldn't do it.
A:	I know
A:	but he's a man
A:	come on,
A:	men know how to do that, right?
B:	Right,
B:	he's supposed to be able to do that.
A:	I know so,
A:	I felt kind of sorry for him.
A:	that must have been hard on him because he's just a person
A:	but, um, I never ,
A:	a major owner of our of the team here.
B:	Oh, really?
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's like, I thought he was the owner
A:	but it turns out my Mom said that he's part owner
A:	but he must own the biggest chunk
A:	because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, I even know his name because he's on the news a lot,
A:	and I never had to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I've been watching, uh,
B:	my husband's French
B:	and so if I've been watching the French news, when I watch it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's incentive ,
B:	speaking of Bush, we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush, they that had a story where he went to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff.
A:	Oh, I saw that.
B:	Did you see that, where he, the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he said his .
A:	I want to see your driver's
A:	I, I, I don't,
B:	I know
B:	and see a credit card
A:	you're not President Bush.
A:	I know
A:	and he said
A:	yeah,
A:	it does so fast ,
A:	I heard it on the radio.
A:	I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car
A:	but I didn't see it
A:	but,
B:	It was so funny to see,
B:	it was a really cute little kid too.
A:	That's about my extent of, um, about baseball,
A:	I don't know, that much about it.
B:	Well, I can tell you, that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game,
B:	and I couldn't tell you who pitched,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they won,
B:	the Mets won.
A:	Did they?
B:	But, yeah,
B:	not my a lot, *sp? by
B:	and then somebody else lost,
B:	maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees, or New Jersey.
A:	That's so stupid that you all have two teams.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's really stupid.
B:	Well, but it,
B:	then they can have them play against each other.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	I think it's still the New York Yankees, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I thought they were moving to New Jersey
B:	This is how much I know about baseball.
A:	The Texas Rangers, they, they lost, I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I know that last year
A:	we did go to a baseball game last year.
A:	We got free tickets because someone at our church, one of the deacons at church, um, parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the, uh, the places and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he's their head chauffeur,
A:	is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.
B:	Right .
A:	Yeah,
A:	he makes good money too doing that,
A:	you'd be I was shocked,
A:	but anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then the Iranian couldn't,
A:	he didn't want them,
A:	so he gave them to Alan,
A:	and Alan and his Dad had plans that night
A:	so they gave them to us,
A:	so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian, with baseball tickets,
B:	With baseball tickets.
A:	and we ended up with them, right.
A:	And so we were, walking up
B:	Yeah .
A:	and I looked at my husband
A:	and I said, you know what Kyle this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip
A:	I bet these are really good seats
A:	and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,
B:	Wow.
A:	oh, yeah,
A:	we they called us at five
A:	and the game started at seven
A:	so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked
A:	and so we took two kids with us
A:	and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
B:	Because they're fancy seats and stuff.
A:	yeah,
A:	and you just sit down
A:	and all the girls were all dressed up you know,
A:	I just was there, you know,
A:	like I'm loaded,
A:	I'm here, you know,
A:	and, uh, it was just kind of funny
A:	because, you know, but we got to sit by first base
A:	if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.
B:	I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game.
B:	I rarely go
B:	but we went last year
B:	because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if there's a game on, he's watching it.
B:	I mean, that's all there is to it,
A:	Really?
B:	and he's like glued at the T V.
A:	I'm glad my husband's not like that.
B:	Oh, I'm glad my husband's not like that either,
B:	I'd kill him
B:	My brother's like that
B:	and, um, see he goes to a lot of games,
B:	not a real lot,
B:	but he tries to go,
B:	then my father got us some tickets,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so my brother's wife and my husband and I went.
B:	Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd,
B:	it was nice weather and stuff,
B:	it wasn't a real problem,
B:	but you sit there in a crowd,
B:	and you're waiting and waiting and waiting
B:	and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um,
B:	because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,
A:	That's funny.
B:	and, um, so you sit there
B:	and you wait for the longest time really bored,
B:	and then all of a sudden something happens
B:	but you happen to look the other way during the time,
A:	You miss the whole thing.
B:	yeah,
B:	and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
B:	and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of O strip east to west, eastern part,
A:	That's funny.
A:	Where is he from in France?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but that ,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I have a, I had a friend in college from Strasbourg,
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's not that far,
B:	he was sort of in between Strasbourg, and Paris.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Paris.
A:	And my cousin lives in Paris
A:	and she's lived there for like, oh, off and on for twenty years.
B:	Oh, is she still there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because,
A:	Saint Claude is that sound familiar?
B:	Yeah,
B:	Saint Claude,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	we used to,
B:	that's one of the, um, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I exactly where she is.
B:	But, um, we met in Paris.
A:	That's neat.
A:	Yeah,
A:	she married
A:	and they have twelve children.
B:	Twelve children?
A:	She has twelve children.
B:	Oh, my God, the poor woman.
A:	She looks gorgeous,
A:	no
A:	she's gorgeous
A:	and she just liked having kids
A:	and she's thin
A:	and, I mean, four or more children are thin,
B:	Were any of them twins?
A:	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
B:	You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
A:	No,
A:	your,
A:	I have a friend now that has seven.
A:	And, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they're all real young,
A:	they're just raised right
A:	that's what God's told them to do
A:	but they're not condemning you,
A:	if you,
A:	we only have one child, you know,
A:	they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do that,
A:	you get a conviction like that
A:	and you think everyone should have it.
A:	And so I'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't do that at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You go in their bathroom
A:	and there's ten tooth brushes in there.
A:	And I always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
B:	But how do they afford to even have the kids, uh,
B:	we're expecting our first baby, almost any day Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They live lean for one thing
A:	and they tithe
A:	and they
A:	it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole
A:	we don't honor God with this portion
A:	and so they,
A:	I think that helps a lot.
A:	I think that's the key, in he, like his sales last year
A:	he just works a normal job.
A:	He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand,
A:	but last year he made
A:	that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.
A:	He loves God,
A:	I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
B:	Wow.
A:	and he got to do it
A:	and so God just really blesses him in ways like that,
A:	do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a blessing
A:	and, and some people you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,
A:	but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things
A:	but it's a different kind
A:	and a lot times people think, oh, well, I'm not blessed
A:	I have an old car.
A:	But you've got five kids, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,
A:	there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he's, you know,
A:	a lot of wisdom in it.
A:	And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything
A:	but training, and training is different than anything else
A:	in, in psychology doesn't address it.
A:	A lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE
A:	and they don't quote you the proverb out of it,
A:	but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the BIBLE
A:	and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child
A:	so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What I mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing
A:	and so, you know, they do that
A:	and they, they just live lean pretty much
A:	they don't, she doesn't shop at Foley's you know, and stuff like that.
A:	But a lot women die or shop at Foley's
A:	so things ,
B:	I, I don't know what Foley's is
A:	It's like a Macy's, kind of store,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's pretty nice
A:	and everything's pretty expensive
A:	and, you know, you just can't do that
A:	and you don't go to baseball games as much
A:	or you get pictures like we did.
A:	You know what I mean?
B:	Yeah.
A:	You do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways
A:	and I know Manhattan's real expensive
A:	but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that makes a really big difference.
B:	But, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
A:	Well, church softball leagues,
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they're not all boys
A:	and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one
A:	and I just haven't gotten around to doing it.
A:	I keep saying we need to have one.
A:	They go, okay, then start one.
A:	But everybody wants to do it
A:	but, you know, God's sitting on my heart
A:	and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it,
A:	but anyway, so they could really only have four members on the team.
A:	I think they only have four boys .
A:	I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids *listen: this and utt2 as one utt
A:	are the they are so good.
A:	I'm not kidding you
A:	but she does work with them
A:	and it's a commitment
A:	and, that, that's what they're called to do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have a,
A:	most of my friends,
B:	I admire someone that can do that, you know,
B:	I really can.
A:	I know,
A:	I do too,
A:	I, most of my friends have three or four kids
A:	and they feel like, you know, that's really why God
A:	and some of the people in our church use birth control
A:	and some of them don't,
A:	I had my tubes tied
A:	so you,
B:	Well, this is a good subject, isn't it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's, it's something that you can really talk about.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it,
B:	but,  but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,  it's such a big area
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there's so many different problems there.
B:	Uh, what do you want to concentrate on.
A:	It doesn't matter to me.
B:	Well, uh, I'll tell you something,
B:	um, I, I have a sister-in-law from Israel,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.
B:	They, they believe that they, they belong there
B:	and they've belonged there forever,
B:	and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less,
B:	they, they consider them second class.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, they're really quite arrogant about it.
B:	I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.
A:	Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States intervening with Patriot missiles,
A:	did, did they,
B:	Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but, I didn't really talk about that with her.
B:	She, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, Switzerland.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an,
B:	and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them,
B:	and they really treat them like second class citizens.
B:	They, they don't really want them around
B:	but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they, they really do,
B:	they look down on them.
B:	And, I don't know, being,
B:	I, I live in, uh, Vermont
B:	and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black.
B:	We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people
B:	because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know,
B:	it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.
B:	And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals
B:	and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs
B:	and they, they send their kids to school
B:	and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's just a different world.
A:	Well I live in San Antonio
A:	and fifty percent of the population is minority.
B:	Oh, um, I talked to someone about San Antonio,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos,
B:	I don't know,
B:	do they call it the barrio down there.
A:	That's the barrios
A:	but it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city.
A:	It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I heard that San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it it just has a really bad problem.
A:	I grew up outside of Houston
A:	and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.
B:	Yeah,
B:	like say Houston.
B:	Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city.
A:	Houston is not at all.
B:	No, huh,
B:	there's a lot of crime?
A:	Yes
A:	there's quite a bit of crime.
B:	Oh, my, um,
B:	yeah,
B:	like I, we're so protected up here,
B:	it's, it's really strange.
B:	I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're just so protected.
B:	But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians.
B:	You know, the Israelis can do anything they want
B:	but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd.
B:	Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities
B:	and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.
A:	Huh.
B:	So they don't have that.
B:	But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq?
A:	I think it's unfortunate, uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned,
A:	it,
A:	I
B:	It's just what do you do for them,
B:	you want to do something for them,
B:	but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately,
A:	but we've kind of driven these people out.
B:	To do it,
B:	yeah,
B:	but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise.
B:	And that's what they did
B:	and now they're like asking him for help
B:	and he's like, no we can't get involved.
B:	What my husband had very strong feelings,
B:	he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf,
B:	he said, um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job.
A:	Sure.
B:	He should, he should have let them, um, corner the Republican Guards,
A:	Well I think the war ended too soon.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly,
B:	that's what everyone says.
A:	Yeah.
B:	everyone I talk to, they says, you know,
B:	it's real easy to say that.
A:	We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal.
A:	We damaged most of it
A:	but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.
B:	They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us
B:	so we're just going to let them go,
B:	but really we didn't think about the people that he was going,
B:	and I mean, he, he's just,
A:	Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait.
A:	And once that was accomplished it,
B:	They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and right,
B:	what they were going to say.
B:	And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So they were, they were playing it very safe,
B:	but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever.
A:	Yeah.
B:	they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
B:	and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because he had the
B:	he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.
B:	it was going to make such a mess.
B:	I mean I feel really sorry for these people,
B:	these people are middle class people, just like us.
B:	Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you knew this,
B:	these people are going to come
B:	and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you.
B:	Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry
B:	and you're going to run.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.
A:	I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come.
A:	I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.
B:	Well you know what I was hoping?
B:	I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know,
B:	and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know,
B:	but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives,
A:	They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
B:	but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians,
B:	why they didn't go save,
B:	I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish,
B:	I know the Shiites are their people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I don't know,
B:	I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds.
A:	There are some Kurds living in Iran.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think they should have just done more, uh,
B:	and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.
B:	It's, it's just so complicated.
A:	I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	well, you,
B:	knowing them, they're very, um, oh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	almost compare them to a very egotistical man.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You're damn right,
B:	I'm going to protect my family, you know,
B:	so, I, I was amazed too.
B:	I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	I was, I
B:	that part scared me.
B:	That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out
B:	and I just saw atomic bomb,
A:	Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um,
A:	I, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on
A:	and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.
A:	That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about,
A:	because I, because we never went to war.
A:	I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out
A:	and I,  I feel like it went on and on.
B:	Right.
A:	And I, I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what was happening.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman
A:	and I'm not sure that's our role,
A:	but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree with that,
B:	I was, I was fairly young at the time too,
B:	I, I really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, my husband is a Vietnam veteran
B:	and you know, he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on, he,
B:	it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have, from the people or the administration, either one.
A:	of static throughout Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time?
A:	I mean I do think that, it's been too long in coming
A:	but I feel like maybe the American people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that  that those,
B:	Right.
A:	so many people were opposed to the war,
A:	what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it
A:	and those guys were there doing their duty.
B:	That's right,
B:	I mean, they weren't there by choice
B:	and, and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I, I think that we learned from that
A:	and I think it, it's one of those things that you learn the hard way.
A:	It was a tragic mistake,
B:	Right.
A:	the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around. Just now, you know, trying to be rectified
A:	and I'm, and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally,  on so many of the people.
B:	Right.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think you can
B:	and I, I agree with you that I, I think that the, the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in, in, in every aspect of it
B:	and I, I agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.
B:	I mean they're still not settled over there.
A:	No,
A:	they're not.
B:	And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not sooner.
A:	Well I, I appreciate the
A:	I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot.
A:	He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then he has backed out,
A:	he has pulled out.
A:	And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein,
A:	so why aren't you helping us?
A:	And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.
B:	I think it would too.
A:	And I don't think the U S will stand for it.
A:	I don't think he would do that,
B:	No,
A:	uh, I think we learned too much of the effects.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree with that.
A:	Uh, you know whether it was justified or not, I know, that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.
A:	I, I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and,  and beat the communism,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, but I think somewhere that got lost.  You know, in the long term effects of the, of the war
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and,
B:	you have to, you know, you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he, he said that's what we were going there to do
B:	and he did what, what he said
B:	and he did pull out before it got any further than that where,  where it would have turned into more of a police action. Uh, or more of a political action I guess, you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as, as another country.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries
B:	and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address.
A:	That we don't get fixed.
B:	That's right.
A:	I know.
B:	And, and that's what frustrates me more than anything.
A:	And I, I believe that we have to have a military
A:	and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us.
B:	Right.
A:	But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward.
B:	I think there's a lot of waste
B:	and, and they don't, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start addressing some of the other issues,
B:	I think we could take care of everything. And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world,  you know, who just end up using things against us later on anyway.
A:	I know,
A:	I do think that in the Middle East war, um,
A:	I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.
B:	Right.
A:	An, uh, and I think that's good, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's a good,
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of good has come from this one.
A:	I think so too.
B:	And I think, I guess, in, in, uh, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war
B:	because like we, we said earlier, that, you know, the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of, of that war
B:	and and,
A:	And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	So, I, I, I do think that, we've learned from it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, I, I, I wish there weren't war
B:	Yeah,
B:	no kidding.
A:	But, uh, I do think we learned.
B:	And I just, I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid,  for, you know, nothing.
A:	Yes.
B:	I mean, it was, they're, they still don't know what they were there for.
A:	No,
A:	there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal,
A:	no,
B:	No.
A:	we went in
A:	but what did we do.
A:	We lost lives
A:	and, and what were we trying to do.
A:	Who knows.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	And, I, I think you're right,
A:	uh, I think you're right there.
A:	Um, I do remember when it was over.
A:	I remember when they were coming home.
A:	Uh, but, I remember the feeling back then, you know,
A:	like I feel like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	there's a lot of people that aren't for war.
A:	I'm not for war,
B:	Right.
A:	but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right.
A:	I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.
B:	Right.
A:	I just remember,
A:	oh yeah,
A:	our guys are over there
A:	and it's sad
A:	and we shouldn't be fighting a war
A:	but there was no, let's support them, you know.
B:	Right,
B:	the,
B:	when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and, you know,  their, all the demonstrations that were going on.
A:	Yeah.  That's right.
B:	I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity
B:	because those kind of people, I mean, you know, they're the kind of people who are, who've always got to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent.
B:	They've got to have a cause
B:	and,  and, I, you know, nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're, you're supporting the war.
B:	you have to support the people that are there.
A:	That's right.
B:	And for some reason those people don't see that.
A:	They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	they don't
B:	and, you know, they're just real shallow people.
A:	I would agree with you there
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I agree.
A:	Um, and I, and I recall when President Bush said that, you know,
A:	he said look,
A:	I, you know, I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war.
A:	There's a lot of us that are opposed to war
A:	but, uh, you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing.
A:	And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that.
B:	Yeah,
A:	But,
B:	I mean they're not helping anybody.
B:	That's the, that's the whole point,
A:	not.
B:	they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves.
A:	That's true.
B:	And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves. You know.
A:	Uh.
A:	Giving a soapbox to stand on
B:	Yeah
A:	But, well, I just, I, I'm glad we've learned.
A:	I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm especially sorry for the people that are, you know, have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally,
A:	because, you know until the past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that,  for them.
B:	That's true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and I think that's where we as American people really failed, you know, failed them.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, I don't know.
A:	Well, do you have anything else you want to say on this?
B:	No,
B:	I guess not.
A:	I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer
B:	I know,
B:	we get cut off all the time, too
A:	Usually I can talk all day
A:	but this is something to me that's sad
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	So, well have a good day
A:	and I appreciate the conversation.
B:	Thanks,
B:	same here.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	So the general topic is hobbies.
B:	Yes.
A:	Let's hear about your hobbies.
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	what kind of hobbies do I have?
B:	I guess, uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing.
B:	I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Any handicrafts?
B:	Excuse me.
A:	Any handicrafts?
B:	No,
B:	not, not really, um,
B:	no,
B:	I'm really not too creative
B:	well, I, uh, you know, around with my hands and things like that
B:	I leave that more up to my Mom
A:	So, um, I think I'm in handicraft.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I think it will become resume writing.
B:	Oh, well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	I, I hate to think about it
A:	and, and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it,
B:	what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking for the, uh, different shifts up there?
A:	I
A:	who knows.
B:	Is it, uh,
B:	basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,
A:	No,
A:	all means about fifteen to twenty percent,  of, of, oh,
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	I'm sure the number's somewhere classified
A:	but some of the internal news and the news services,
A:	so, it's approximately six fifty,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five
A:	and twenty percent would be one thirty.
B:	Wow,
B:	how about that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's possible.
B:	How about that.
B:	Well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate
B:	is there many other,
B:	are you in the defense?
A:	Oh, yes, .
B:	Is it, uh, many other corporations in the area?
A:	Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring.
B:	Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding
B:	I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?
A:	Yes.
B:	That, uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.
A:	Yeah, uh,
A:	no,
A:	Apple's coming to town
A:	and,  and that has some opportunities
B:	Oh, really?
A:	and, uh, and,
B:	Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs?
A:	Colorado Springs specifically,
A:	yes.
B:	How about that.
A:	And, uh, and, uh, M C I coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death
A:	but,
B:	Well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing?
A:	Uh, I'm a defense worker.
A:	I'm, government tool control specialist.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also.
A:	Are you still employed?
B:	Am I still employed by T I,
B:	no,
B:	I took a leave of, of T I back in November.
A:	Oh.
B:	Actually, December was my first month away from them.
A:	Exempt or ?
B:	Exempt.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.
B:	It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave,
B:	but it was just an opportunity arose
B:	and decided to take it.
A:	Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package.
B:	No.
B:	I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there,
B:	but it was just, I missed it by a couple months.
B:	But, you know, what can one do.
B:	I'm just happy still to have a job.
A:	So, are you happy with what you are doing now?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am kind of happy with it,
B:	it's getting better all the time,
B:	I knew it would be different from the very beginning,
B:	but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system,
B:	so I was in the computer operations
B:	it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar
B:	there's, you know, there's benefits
B:	and there's things that weren't as good,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.
A:	Good,
A:	good.
A:	Well, it hasn't been a long time T I
A:	or I,  I'm significantly shaken by the situation,  but not devastated.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing
B:	and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the the defense area but manufacturing in general.
A:	To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's great.
B:	That's good.
A:	And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time,  just, just to know, what's, possibilities are,  you know, what might happen.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table.
A:	But still in all,  it feels funny.
B:	It may be a blessing in disguise.
B:	I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused
B:	and they're just,
B:	actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.
A:	So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,  I can't seem to get into it right now.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide on a pass ,
A:	Uh, situational.
A:	I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, would you like to be there?
A:	I,
A:	all things being equal, yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, or, or even somewhere better,
B:	Sure.
A:	but, God this is much better than west Texas.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Well, just take the day,
A:	But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.
B:	Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.
A:	I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.
B:	Oh, that's a beautiful place.
A:	Goes to U T.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's just fantastic down there.
B:	Take it more as a,
B:	this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,
B:	pick out where you want to live,
B:	and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.
A:	I see that's the problem.
A:	For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,  and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
A:	And now I feel lost.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's a,
B:	it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it.
A:	Oh, I had job offers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.
A:	And that,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something
B:	if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.
B:	That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,
B:	I'll take a chance,
B:	if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.
A:	Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed?
B:	Five years.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've been with them sixteen.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can imagine, you know, the longer and longer it goes,
A:	Actually, seventeen now,
A:	and, oh, yeah,
A:	momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But so, yeah,
A:	I'm looking as, as a opportunity.
B:	Well, that's good,
B:	you've got a good attitude about it.
A:	And, and I'm looking at it as a change.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.
B:	Right,
B:	there you go.
B:	That's the way to do it.
A:	And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.
B:	There you go,
B:	that's the thing to do.
B:	That's much funner than doing any kind of job.
A:	Ha, how about we end this?
B:	That will work out just fine.
A:	Nice talking to you.
B:	All right,
B:	nice talking to you.
A:	Bye.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	What's the, uh,
A:	in Texas law has a, uh, what does it have, it has a death penalty doesn't it?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	yeah.
B:	They just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within the past few years
B:	You know for quite some time, just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty.
A:	But now it's coming back into favor.
B:	Uh, yes.
B:	Well, they find it is more deterrent.
A:	Well, my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent.
A:	Uh, but now that's just what they said.
A:	Uh, I don't know maybe, maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.
B:	Well, uh, if you, You know, compare the figures, I think that's where they're, uh, they're coming from.
A:	Maybe they've changed their minds.
B:	The, uh,
A:	Maybe that's it.
A:	Maybe that's it,
A:	because that was back in the seventies.
B:	Oh, they're yes. They are.
B:	That was before the, uh, uh, they adopted the death law again
B:	But, uh, I, I myself am in favor of it, uh, particularly for, uh, well I think Texas has a good, good law. Uh, crimes, murders related with, uh, drugs or killing a policemen.
A:	I think,
A:	I agree.
A:	But I think it ought to be expanded to include children.
A:	I, I think they're, they have they're working on, uh, something in Austin now,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'm not sure what it is,
A:	I just remember seeing a, uh, kind of a synopsis of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, why stop at children?
B:	Why not go to adults, too?
A:	Well, uh, I'm, I'm personally very in favor of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or or tried to, or done their very, you know, given their best effort at doing that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep.
A:	I, I don't care to support them.
B:	Well, I don't either
B:	but, uh, uh, but there is something to be said about
B:	or, uh, uh, just for the sake of argument, I'm taking the,  a con,
A:	Sure.
B:	I'm, I'm against it.
B:	Uh, you know yourself how many times have you heard where, uh, uh, a citizen was wrongfully arrested,  and served time at a penitentiary, uh,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh
B:	just recently this, uh, black man served nine years was it,  for robbery.
A:	And then,  there was the black woman that, uh, robbed and shot the furrier.
A:	And she was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But she actually killed the furrier. Or someone,
A:	she was charged with murder
A:	and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something.
A:	I didn't, I don't, I didn't retain all those facts very well.
A:	But I know what you're,
A:	what if we make a mistake.
B:	That's it.
A:	And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I don't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately.
B:	I, like you, say yes
B:	let's have it,  put them all, give them all a shot, get rid of them.
A:	Well,  Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty.
B:	Why should they be sitting in, uh, prison getting their college degree.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now that's tougher.
A:	It's easier to say it on the telephone
A:	and everyone agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way to go,
A:	it's a deterrent to crime,
A:	they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.
A:	But to be the actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me.
B:	Yes,
B:	very true.
B:	I, uh, I agree with you there. Uh-huh.
A:	I think I'd probably do it
A:	but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance.
A:	It, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing to say that, oh, sure I would,
A:	but I don't know
B:	Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that.
B:	Uh, I, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to.
A:	Well, yes,
A:	but, you know, that's what they did.
B:	It,
B:	true.
B:	Very true.
B:	But they, they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason.
A:	Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted.
B:	Yeah Uh-huh
A:	And they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the human life.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
B:	Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,  that it is,  it should be in effect.
A:	Hang them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree it should be in effect.
A:	Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,
A:	so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect
A:	but I want maybe
A:	well, I'd, I, now I have a problem with this, too.
A:	I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.
B:	Oh, that's true.
B:	Well now any, uh, just believe in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal.
A:	That's correct.
A:	It is,
A:	it is.
B:	And, uh, uh, yes,
B:	I'm inclined to agree with you.
B:	I think so,
B:	there should be a limit as to the number of appeals.
A:	Now, there's some,
A:	and maybe, now, I don't remember if this is Texas or not, that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence.
B:	Um, um, well, Not just for dealing in drugs.
A:	Convicted drug dealers.
B:	It, uh,
A:	Is it, what is, what's the
B:	There are certain circumstances,
B:	and I don't remember what they are.
A:	It's something of the they're on the distribution end.
B:	Uh, yes.
A:	They're not selling them,
A:	they're distributing them.
A:	It's for the large dealers is what,  it's reserved for.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they, they are in effect killing people.
B:	Oh, oh, yes,
B:	yes.
B:	I, I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I think that's the way it's worded.
A:	Is that how it's worded?
A:	I knew it was there
A:	but, I, I,
A:	or or is it proposed
A:	or is it passed?
B:	I do believe that's in.
B:	Uh, I wouldn't swear to it myself.
A:	I believe it is,
B:	But I thought it, I thought it was in effect.
A:	I believe you're right, though.
A:	I think it is.
A:	And I have to agree with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I think it certainly should be one of the options.
A:	Uh, I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so far that I know.
A:	I qualify that heavily,
A:	because you never know,
A:	but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet. Well, my children are about in the same age bracket.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, it does.
B:	Uh, I have four sons myself
B:	and the youngest is twenty-eight,
B:	so they are all pretty well grown up
B:	and they all went through it, you know, going through high school and everything
B:	and knock wood that, uh, they have not,
B:	well I won't say they didn't try it, uh,
B:	I wouldn't know,
B:	but, uh, they,
B:	I doubt very much that they're, they're using it now.
B:	In fact I'm sure they don't.
A:	I think, let's see, the oldest is thirty-two
A:	and the youngest is probably twenty-seven, twenty-eight.
B:	Huh.
A:	So, it's the same age bracket.
B:	Yes.
A:	And there's four, two girls and two boys.
A:	And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's usually the way it is.
B:	It, it's just, uh, try it out with their peers
B:	And none of them even smoke.
B:	They don't, uh,
B:	they never,
B:	strangely enough, uh, their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up.
B:	Now, my, my, my wife, my ex-wife, she quit, uh, well, when she was pregnant with the last one
B:	and she never started up again.
B:	And I just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago.
A:	Boy,
A:	that's tough.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
B:	I,
B:	and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by.
A:	My husband hasn't quit, yet.
A:	And he knows he has to
A:	and he knows he should
A:	and he knows
A:	and he knows,
B:	Um.
A:	but he hasn't.
A:	I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me.
A:	He, he's very conscious of, of passive smoking
A:	and he's concerned about it but,  hasn't quite made it yet
B:	Well,  Well, when I was still smoking, I, I felt that way.
B:	If I was in a public restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers I would try to pick a a, a my, seat where the smoke would blow away from them.
B:	Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen all of this,
A:	yeah
B:	And, uh, but, uh, now I'm on, the shoe's on the other foot
B:	Uh, I'm aware of other people smoking now.
A:	Well, Charles will actually, Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own.
B:	Um.
A:	He will get up
A:	and he'll go outside, you know,
A:	and he, he's
A:	so, when we're invited to people's house, he will not smoke in their house. Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very,
B:	Yes.
A:	particularly if they have children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, and he's, you know, he tries his best,
A:	but the actual quitting he hasn't done.
A:	He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like.
A:	He put up all of his ash trays.
A:	He will not smoke in a comfortable position, you know,
A:	but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking
B:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	It's a,  long process.
B:	Well, the,  there's a trick I use.
B:	They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment.
A:	Oh, how neat.
B:	And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one. One at a time.
B:	And, uh, that, that 's, gets to be, uh, a deterrent.
A:	He has his in the kitchen,
A:	It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and, and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful
A:	and we did end up with, uh, I B M, P C which I now would not have chosen
B:	Really?
A:	But that was before the Macintosh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And twenty years ago I was, uh, in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter
B:	Oh, I know it.
A:	So I would say that's one of the largest changes in, at least in my life.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years how much they've uh, increased in use. Or probably eight years,
B:	when I was a freshman in college uh, my degree was in computer, uh, technology originally
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it seemed like it would,
B:	they were just getting out with the, you know, the disks and all that, getting away with the cards,  you know, doing away with the, the programming cards
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	thirty years ago I, I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer
A:	and we had to write code in binary
A:	and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which,  I don't think exists anymore.
B:	I know.
B:	No.
A:	You never see one of those punch cards anymore.
B:	Uh, I think T V has a lot to do with the changes, too. Don't you? In, like, people's attitudes.
A:	Well, very possibly.
A:	Uh, I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before.
A:	Uh, certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes. Even, even the change from black and white to color television.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Thirty years ago I guess there were color T V
A:	but I sure didn't have access to one.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, but, twenty years ago, practically everybody had a color T V,
A:	and now I think they're as, almost as many, well,
A:	there are more T V than households,
A:	so it's close to getting, uh, one T V per person they say
B:	Yeah
B:	And now everybody, uh, has V C R and two or three V C R and that kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Certainly ten years ago, uh, V C R were just coming on the market
A:	so that's made a significant difference in the way I watch television for instance,
A:	because, uh, now I almost never watch a T V program when it's on.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know.
A:	I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient
A:	and that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted.
A:	I can just put it on pause
B:	Yeah,
B:	and you can, you can flip through the commercials
B:	so you don't have to watch the commercials.
A:	Right.
B:	That's always convenient.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	you can watch a program in forty-five minutes instead of an hour
A:	You skip the commercials.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	So, what was our question about, decline in
A:	Wasn't the decline so much.
A:	I think they just said the changes in, uh, social, social changes in the United States.
B:	Yeah.
A:	How was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago.
A:	So,
B:	Well, I can't really remember back that far,
B:	but ten years ago, uh, I don't know. I'd say, like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with A M, what do you call those, little A M radios
A:	Yes.
B:	and now people have jam box with C D players in them, you know.  And,  hand held T V and car phones.
A:	Yes.
A:	That's certainly,  a difference.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's another one,
A:	yeah,
A:	car phones is a good point, and, uh, cellular phones of all types and beepers.
A:	Uh,  ten years ago I was working in a job at a medical center
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I had to carry a beeper around
A:	and they were kind of bulky
A:	and all they did was just, uh, make a beep noise
A:	and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	These days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils
A:	and they fit in your shirt pocket
A:	and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a, a phone number to respond to
A:	and,
B:	Those are cool.
A:	Yeah,
A:	those are pretty neat.
A:	And they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off,  in a theatre or something
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you can still get your messages
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, let's see, social changes, uh, uh,
B:	Where do you think it's, where do you think it's going to go in twenty years?
A:	I haven't the slightest idea.
A:	I was just thinking, though, about a, a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago.
A:	I, I know that because I was writing a paper about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was writing a, a journal article.
A:	Uh, and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything.
A:	And, uh, there was a suspicion,  that it was a virus
B:	Wow.
A:	but nobody had identified it
A:	and they were really just going on epidemiological, uh,  uh, guesswork, uh, because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like, uh, hepatitis
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then,  from, from the spread pattern of hepatitis, they could work backwards to the transmission by, uh, blood and semen.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then I,
B:	I'm curious what was your, uh, graduate study in?
A:	Well, I, I was in English as a matter of fact, and medieval studies,
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, but I went to work as an editor and writer,
A:	so, uh, uh, the, ten years ago I was working in the medical center, uh, publishing a journal and writing about medical topics
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, let's see, twenty years ago, I guess we 're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the, uh, the sex revolution where, uh after the pill
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, uh, freed people up from worries about, uh, illegitimate pregnancy
A:	and, I guess in the seventies is the, the time when that was supposed to have exploded.
A:	Thirty years ago there was no pill.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You think that's caused a lot of pressure on, like younger kids today,  to make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make?
A:	Yes.
A:	I do.
A:	I really do.
A:	I have, uh,  four kids in college right now, children and stepchildren
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I know that the expectation for them was, uh, to have sex and, much earlier,  than the expectation when I was in college.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	In my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be,  sleeping with their boyfriends
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, they certainly didn't expect everybody to
A:	and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in, in the relatively near future.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's kind of scary when I think of what will happen in twenty years, you know, when I have kids and they're grown and uh, just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more
B:	so.
A:	And I guess the answer,  is, is, stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years
B:	Seems like it can't get much worse.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely to be like.
A:	Course, one of them was just a, a, a brand new baby twenty years ago,
A:	so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	And some of the other ones weren't born.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So, sounds like America's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Electronic mail.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just got on that this past, about a year ago
A:	and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things. Even when they're on another continent.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's pretty wild.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Even, you know,
A:	that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten years ago,
A:	but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and nowadays people use Fed Ex, all the time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sure do. Huh.
A:	People do seem to travel more.
A:	It's much more common for people, even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and,  Asia.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I was almost thirty before I got off this continent.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school
B:	Yeah
B:	I know that's what, uh, what my family was talking when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana
B:	and they were like, well, you know, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, especially come home every couple months.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, and,
A:	Okay,
A:	what do you think are some current trends in, uh, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen.
B:	Um, I, I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together.
A:	Yeah
B:	Um, I think, uh, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,
B:	and I've been off doing my thing all day
B:	and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.
A:	Really.
B:	So, uh.
A:	Are you newly married,
A:	or,
B:	Um, two years.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Same, same situation here, I've been married about ten months,
A:	so. Yeah,
A:	I can, I can, I know what you mean.
B:	It's, it's really hard, hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, uh, you both have hobbies that are different.
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,
B:	but my husband and I have different hobbies.
A:	Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector.
A:	That's that's wild.
B:	Um, so he was off today, uh, looking at, at records.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, and I was off, you know, doing, you know, household type things. You know, laundry
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, um, did some shopping and stuff.
A:	Um, from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it,
A:	but, um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more, um, where they could manage their own schedule
A:	and, uh, they could spend more time with their kids
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because they look back
A:	and, you know, they're all like, um, kind of regretful, I think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think, I think that would be the ideal situation,
B:	I think that would be the ideal situation.
B:	I think that a lot of people,
B:	like in my case I, I do shift work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't have that choice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	same here.
B:	Um, I have to be at work at, at X hour, you know, at just, at, at a certain hour
B:	and I can't, it's not flexible.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, it, it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours
B:	and, and maybe after we decide to have kids I, I might find a job that has flexible hours.
B:	I I hope so anyway.
B:	Um, but I would, I don't know.
A:	At T I, is that where you work?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's really kind of sad,
A:	some of the people that I work with they, like when I worked on second shift, um, their their kids go to school during the day
A:	and then they wouldn't see them at night, because they would be in, you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so it was kind of like, they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses.
A:	This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it was really sad, you know that a lot of families, um, have to, well, you know, have to have dual income.
A:	A lot of people choose to, which is fine.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, you know, then the kids kind of suffer.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, ideally, it it would be nice to be able to just have, like, back in the old days, you know, back like when I grew up, you know,
A:	Uh-huh, huh strangely, high
A:	Yeah.
B:	the, the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.
B:	My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that was nice
B:	and I liked that
B:	and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids.
A:	Uh.
B:	But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise,
B:	I don't think it's going to be realistic.
A:	I know.
A:	Unfortunately, that's probably true.
A:	Um, do you think the, the parents spend quality time with their kids
A:	are do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, uh ...
B:	I, yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time.
B:	I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.
A:	Yeah
B:	I think that, um, uh, most, most kids that I see don't really, they don't really value quality time.
A:	Yeah
A:	it's always that way until it's too late.
B:	Until, until they're older
B:	and then they look back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's true, um.
A:	What's, what are some other questions they have,
A:	, I'm not sure.
A:	I know my parents are growing up,
A:	I guess they never spent much time watching T V.
A:	In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the T V,
A:	we didn't really have one .
B:	Oh really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff,
A:	but, you know, my dad had his own business
A:	and it was easier for them to do that,
A:	but, I, I don't know,
A:	it was, I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time.
B:	I, I think kids now a days are raised on T V.
B:	I mean that's, that's almost like a T V a surrogate parent.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good way to put it.
B:	And not a, and not a very good one at that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a pretty good way to put it
A:	If I had kids, well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do? like paper
B:	Um, I, I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong.
B:	I hope, I hope to be able to spend, um, their growing up years, being in the home, you know, not having to work. Um, and being able to do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I, I know a lot of people who, um, um,
B:	I work part-time also,
B:	and I
B:	a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and they, they do a lot of volunteer work
B:	and they're real active in the community
B:	and, um, they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'd, I'd like to be able to do that.
B:	I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids.
A:	Do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff,
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	I hope that happens, in my case.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, I think that's for the, the few and far between.
B:	I think that, uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, um parents out there are, are probably working parents.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Huh
B:	And I, I don't, I don't really see that, that trend changing much,
B:	if anything, I think, there's going to be fewer and fewer, uh, single income families.
A:	I know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids. That may not necessarily be consistent with yours.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly.
B:	See I, I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I, I never went to a day care center,
A:	Yeah
B:	I never, I never had that kind of experience.
A:	Huh. I, well I don't even think we had
A:	I don't even remember them being around when we were little.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I see, it seems like that's, that's a big trend, you know, in the last ten years.
B:	Day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, um, a lot bigger part of, of the kids' lives.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's like a home away from home for a lot of them.
A:	Sure, is, um,
A:	well, I guess we could ring this off since we, we've exhausted all of our ideas,
A:	we seem to agree.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think, yeah I think this is a good closing point.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so,
B:	Well it was really nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you too,
A:	I wish you the best.
B:	Thanks
B:	you too.
A:	Okay
A:	thanks.
B:	Uh, bye,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	do you vote regular?
B:	Yeah,
A:	Every one.
B:	But, uh, that's just since, in the past say about six years.
B:	Before that I really didn't pay any attention at all.
A:	Well see, that's me.
A:	I've never paid any attention to voting.
B:	Oh, you haven't?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I didn't use to,
B:	but now I really,
B:	because I get so angry about what goes on
B:	and then I feel like I can't really complain too much, unless
A:	Unless you have something to do with it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	But the problem is, that I am very liberal politically
B:	and so I hardly ever have anybody that wins that I vote for
A:	Oh, liberal,
A:	by, what do you mean by liberal, um.
B:	Liberal politically,
B:	I'm, you know, like pretty left wing Democrat,
B:	so.
A:	Well see, I don't know anything about politics.
B:	Oh, you don't?
A:	Uh, what's the main, what's the main difference between Republicans and Democrats?
B:	Okay,
B:	well, there's a lot of them, um,
B:	it depends on what issue you're talking about.
B:	But Democrats are, on a lot of issues are more liberal than Republicans,
B:	and well it used to be, it's kind of hard to say now, especially after Desert Storm,
B:	but, um, I think back in the times when, uh, my political opinions were being formed like in during the Vietnam war and stuff, the Republicans were more, you know, what they called Hawks, which is more like aggressive in war and more pro war, and pro aggression
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, the Democrats were the Doves,
B:	they were more for peace.
B:	And I'm not sure how much that holds true anymore,
B:	I think, you know, the issues are,
A:	Okay,
A:	and you vote for the Democrats
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
A:	Usually.
B:	yeah
B:	and Democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and programs to, um,
B:	the big Republican thing is that they don't, they vote for less government,
B:	they want less government involvement, in society
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so they're more, less apt to vote in, you know, more aid to people,
B:	or more, uh, they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things.
A:	Huh, okay.
B:	So,
B:	so have you ever voted at all?
A:	No,
A:	I never have.
B:	You haven't?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	How old are you?
A:	I'm twenty-six.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	I know, I I,
B:	Well.
A:	well, I don't know that much about it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I don't keep up on it
A:	and I don't feel like I have enough knowledge on it to even, you know, to pick the right person.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, Uh-huh.
A:	So that's what they need, well, it, uh, they said something to improve voting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	If they could make it more, oh, easier to find out, you know, what's going on.
A:	Do you know what I mean?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Like, uh, like to me, I don't, I didn't know what would have been wrong with,
A:	I can't even remember who ran for president against Bush.
A:	I think it was, uh, that woman,
A:	wasn't it a woman.
B:	No,
B:	it was Dukakis, from Massachusetts.
A:	Dukakis.
A:	Okay,
A:	didn't he have a woman,
A:	or wasn't, or was that Reagan.
A:	There was a woman that was running for vice president for a while.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	that was,
A:	Ferraro.
B:	yeah
B:	Ferraro.
B:	That was a while ago,
B:	that was a couple elections ago,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's okay.
A:	Well, that's what I mean,
A:	like I didn't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, I didn't know anything about Bush or Dukakis.
B:	So what do you think about, uh, what do you think about what you see on T V about them, like in the news or on the ads,
B:	do you kind of just,
A:	Okay,
A:	I don't remember anything about Dukakis,
B:	You don't?
A:	but, well they're all saying that they're going to do, you know, whatever is best for their campaign anyway.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	That's what I mean,
A:	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know,
A:	like you know, in school they didn't teach you about uh, the government, not really.
B:	Right.
B:	You didn't get any government classes?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's really hard too,
B:	because before they used to have, um, a lot of,
B:	it seems like the stuff that they put out now, it, I mean, I, doesn't just seem like it,
B:	I know for a fact that the, any kind of stuff that if you, wrote and asked for material,
B:	well what do you believe in,
B:	what do you believe in,
B:	they don't take any stands on anything.
B:	They kind of say, well what do you want me to believe.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues.
A:	Well I'm not sure they're,
A:	yeah.
A:	I know how they do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It,
A:	like with the abortion issues and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	they have to kind of take a stand on some things, like abortion and things like that,
B:	so that's kind of, how I judge.
B:	There's a few things where they have to say yes or no, like abortion or gun control,
B:	or let me see,
B:	I try to look at what, if some of the newspaper articles, or the,
B:	I don't trust T V as much,
B:	but newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past
B:	and, but you get, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	it all depends again on who's writing it and who they're for, because they can slant that too.
A:	Right,
A:	and like I said most of the the politicians, I'm ,
A:	also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And everybody's got, you know, stuff they don't want known.
B:	Right,
B:	everybody's got a secret
B:	So,
A:	Well anyway, I'm sorry
A:	I didn't, I didn't have much knowledge.
B:	Well that's okay.
B:	Do you think, do you think, um,
A:	I don't even remember this being on there.
B:	I mean, what would it take,
B:	like, God, this is really good actually, for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted,
B:	I mean, what kind of,
A:	Incentive?
B:	how would it, how, what kind of stuff would they, would you like them to do so that, that you would know more about it.
B:	Like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library
B:	or,
A:	I guess that would be good,
A:	now I'm sure they've got it at the library, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean if I get to the library.
A:	I've got two babies, so, I don't,
A:	yeah,
B:	Oh do you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that will tie you down a little bit.
A:	But I, I don't know.
B:	Or do you just not, do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote
B:	or,
A:	Oh, I know if enough people think like that it, you know, would make a difference, if people stopped thinking like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, well a lot of people, they'll vote the way their family votes, you know, Then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	right.
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	I mean,
B:	Well, not in my family
A:	No.
B:	We're kind of, we're really independent.
A:	All split.
B:	But a lot of families do that.
B:	I know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote.
A:	Right.
B:	And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved
B:	Golly.
A:	I lie. Huh.
B:	But well,
A:	I don't know,
A:	if I did understand politics I probably would vote more,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But like I said if I voted for Bush,
A:	or like when, uh, Gary Hart was running, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking,
B:	Hart?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	not that I think he was good looking,
A:	but, he was young.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But because it,
A:	what,
A:	he had an affair,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and it just threw him out of the whole running.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And a lot of people go by their, uh, personal life when they vote
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life, you're going to let it come into work
A:	but, I'm sure there's a lot of people that have had,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think everybody does,
B:	it just depends on how well you can hide it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, and I,
B:	that's very true,
B:	I, I think that doesn't really have that much to do with, um, unless they've done something really horrible, you know, or something real abnormal.
A:	Well,
A:	Well, criminal or something like that's different,
B:	Yeah,
B:	right,
A:	but, if him and his wife weren't getting along,
B:	but otherwise.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, what is, what effect does that have on him running for president.
A:	Do you know what I mean?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's all so secretive,
A:	see we really don't see the, the true person anyway.
B:	That's right.
B:	I think that's, that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run, is that, um, the, the election, the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that, you know, that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job.
A:	Right.
B:	But see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what, you know, the issues that people really want to know about, because on those issues you have to say yes or no.
B:	And if they don't say yes or no, then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side.
B:	Do you know what I'm saying?
A:	Right.
B:	So they just try and make it a personal thing,
B:	I mean, if you remember any of the T V commercials from the last presidential campaign, in they all had, uh, pictures of Bush with his grandchildren, walking around with his grandchildren
B:	and even from Reagan, it was all just like, looks like a McDonald's commercial, you know.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	That's about what it looked like.
A:	Well what did you think of Reagan as a president?
B:	I just thought he was really inept.
B:	I don't think he did anything at all.
B:	He, they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet
B:	and the people that were,
A:	Do you think he won from Carter because of the, um, the hostages that were held at that time?
B:	Well I think that was part of it,
B:	I think there's a lot of the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the, the recession and stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable,
B:	but he, actually,
B:	all right,
B:	this
B:	I thought he was great.
A:	I thought Carter was good too,
A:	and that was,
A:	yeah,
B:	Did you?
B:	I always liked him,
B:	I thought he was great at the time
B:	and I, I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him.
B:	I, you know, that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out.
A:	But, I think I wasn't,
A:	well let's see,
A:	that's been about ten years ago, right?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	so I was only fifteen or sixteen,
A:	but I remember Carter
A:	and I liked him.
B:	You did?
B:	Have you heard stuff about him lately,
B:	do you know what he's doing?
A:	No,
A:	I sure don't.
B:	Well he is just, he is really active still politically.
B:	He's been overseas.
B:	You remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East, for
A:	Well, what are your,
A:	did you like, do you use credit cards?
B:	Uh, not very often.
B:	I usually, uh,
B:	the ones we use is like Visa
B:	and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	I have, uh, uh, .
A:	So it doesn't get , uh, uh, the credit, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	the interest rate is so high that you're really,
A:	if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy, I think, don't you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Otherwise, you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly, uh, it's not a very good idea.
B:	That's right.
B:	Do you have a lot of credit cards?
A:	Well, I have a lot of them
A:	but I don't use them very much, though.
B:	Right.
A:	I use them mostly for big things, like maybe, sometimes, uh, tuition if it's, you know, if I'm short, to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can.
A:	The other thing, I, I think if you do get overextended a little bit, you need to be sure and pay it off, uh, more than one at a time, because I think you could run forever paying what they require.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Just goes on and on.
B:	Which is what they want.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think a lot of people go in debt because they think, oh, you know, I can just charge it,
B:	but really, I mean, if they don't have the money then, they aren't going to have it in a month,
B:	so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	they, uh, make the mistake of,  pushing all their cards .
A:	There are times,  when it's, when it's very useful,  like, uh, emergency trip, or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Sometimes when you, when you,
A:	the money will be available,
A:	but it's, you know, not immediately handy.
A:	I think, uh, they're very helpful, plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I, you really do need to be very, um, oh, responsible about it
A:	or you end up in deep trouble.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I made that mistake when I first got a job
B:	and that's kind of like,
B:	it took me quite a while to pay them off,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so after that I decided, well, I'm not going to use them at all, and just try to pay cash for everything
B:	and that worked for a while
B:	and then we got married
B:	so we decided to, you know, if we used them we would pay them off as we go.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Right.
A:	That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances.
A:	The other thing about them is too, if you really don't, you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed, and haven't developed a credit thing. It stops you from doing a lot of things.
A:	If you, if you pay for everything by cash, uh, there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or, a car.
B:	Right.
B:	That's true,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, so they, they have become a very vital part of our, of our monetary system  over the last few years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, it's true,
A:	you have to be very careful or you end up, uh, going in the deep end
A:	and, uh, and an awful lot of people are in trouble.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have a boy living with us who works for a credit card, uh, company that,
A:	and he makes calls to people who have problems, you know, credit problems, that are trying to work out
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and, uh, Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night because the world has so many problems of that sort,
B:	Oh.
A:	so it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a really big problem I think, and, um, takes mature people to, to treat it, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so that it's, so that it's a real advantage to you, instead of a disadvantage.
B:	Right.
B:	I think, um, the way the tax system was, they encouraged people to use credit cards, you know, with a big write off at the end of the year.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But now, it's like, it's punch money, because
A:	Right.
A:	It didn't do you any good now, does it?
B:	you cannot,
B:	right.
B:	You cannot write off your interest.
A:	Even before it probably wasn't, though, because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it, you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, well, I'm not,
A:	other than that, I don't have too much on credit cards
A:	but,
A:	It's good to talk to you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You, too.
B:	Thanks for calling.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	bye now
B:	Bye.
A:	So.
B:	Okay,
B:	do you exercise regularly.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I sure do.
B:	What do you do?
A:	Uh, I ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh, work out with free weights
B:	Okay,
B:	I love to ride a bicycle.
A:	I live right near White Rock Lake,
A:	so I used to, I try to ride, about ten to twenty miles a day.
A:	But, I haven't been doing so well this year,
B:	Oh, that's good.
A:	but,
B:	I went an, last year I went an was exercising on a bike for a while
B:	and I, when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day,
B:	the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel.
B:	It was the sweating, not the burn
A:	Oh that's weird .
B:	that was wild
B:	But, I exercise, I don't exercise now,
B:	I just had a baby three months ago,
B:	I haven't really gotten back into exercising.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But I exercised real good for a couple of years.
B:	It was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week
B:	and it was running three nights a week.
A:	So what's your motivation?
B:	What, what's my motivation?
A:	Yeah.
B:	A friend of mine, always pushing me.
B:	This was in Louisiana.
B:	And she would push, you know,
B:	she was, hey,
B:	let's go do it,
B:	and you know, she wouldn't take no for an answer
A:	Was it for health, or, to look good?
B:	Oh, I I just wanted to look good,
B:	yeah,
A:	I was think,
B:	it wasn't really health related.
A:	It was just a side benefit.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	because I'm not , I'm not big or anything,
B:	but I'm not in great shape,
B:	so. But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape.
B:	I didn't build up muscle, though,
B:	I just got real good and toned.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't think women look good with muscles.
A:	Up to a point.
B:	Up to a point,
B:	no,
B:	yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so what was, what was the other question,
A:	let's see, do you do it as a task
A:	or do you enjoy, enjoy working out.
B:	I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think I, uh, I enjoy it sometimes
A:	and there's other times when I just get tired of it
A:	and, and I feel like I'm obligated to do it, because I've been doing it
B:	Yeah.
A:	so I should keep up.
B:	You don't want to lose yourself.
A:	And there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to, to get started.
B:	Well how old are you?
A:	I'm, uh, twenty-seven.
B:	Okay,
B:	so you're still young.
A:	Yeah,
A:	still young, getting older.
B:	We all are,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh,
B:	It's not hard to stay,
B:	well if you keep working out when you're young though, when you get older, you know, your body's not going to look as bad.
B:	I seen an old woman today,
B:	she was about eighty
B:	and she looked so good,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean she was standing just as straight and tall
B:	and she had a small waist
B:	and she didn't have, you know, like,
B:	you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle.
A:	Right.
B:	she didn't have that at all.
B:	She, her lips were a little bit wide,
B:	but a lot of,
B:	back in her time, they liked women with big hips anyway
A:	Right.
B:	so she may be keeping that on purpose,
B:	so
A:	Yeah,
A:	I notice if you, uh, if you stay in shape you don't age as bad,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I think, too.
A:	I was, I go to school, too, at night
A:	and last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot,
A:	and you just,
A:	those kind of things age you more.
B:	Well smoking ages you quick,
A:	Right,
A:	an
B:	it puts those little wrinkles around your lips.
A:	right
A:	an you can't,
A:	and then, you know, it just kind of feeds itself.
A:	You smoke,
A:	and then you don't work out because you,
B:	You get winded.
A:	Right,
A:	and so,
B:	Oh, I smoke a pack a day
B:	an,
A:	I finally quit because, like I just, all I was doing was going down hill fast.
B:	I can't quit smoking,
B:	I've tried.
B:	I was telling a friend of mine that I'd be almost as bad as being an alcoholic,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I can't quit smoking.
B:	I've tried,
B:	I just can't do it.
B:	I quit when I was pregnant with my kids,
B:	but, you know, as soon as I had them, right back to it.
A:	Right back to them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was like, you know,
B:	that was the only reason I quit.
B:	I didn't want to.
A:	Oh that's,
B:	And I don't want to quit smoking,
B:	I enjoy that.
B:	I said I have very few vices,
B:	I'll keep this one thank you
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, uh, did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything?
A:	I went to health club a few years ago,
A:	and now I work out at home, because I don't really, my schedule with school and work, I don't have time to get down to one.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There used to be one that was a twenty-four hour that I used to go to
A:	but, uh, I actually prefer to work out alone.
B:	I like to work out with people,
A:	Really.
B:	I need,
B:	like you,
B:	I, I need competition, is what I need.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I've got to have somebody to compete with,
B:	or I don't want to do anything.
A:	I wouldn't mind having, you know, working out with a friend and, and stuff
A:	but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	are you,
A:	You know, I like to start, get it done and get out of there.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	are you married or anything?
A:	No,
A:	I'm not.
B:	No,
B:	well, get your girlfriend to work out with you.
B:	A lot of women like that.
B:	I'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him.
B:	He doesn't work out very often.
B:	Course, he don't need to.
B:	He's small
B:	and he works as a laborer on the railroad.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know, he's building his muscles up all day,
B:	he doesn't have to do anything.
A:	Right.
B:	He can eat like a horse, too.
B:	And he don't, you know, he don't gain it like I do.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Uh, especially having a kid, I guess, tends to just gain weight because you have to, to, to, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	you have to.
B:	Well you can gain too much weight.
B:	I gained a little bit too much,
B:	but I looked,
B:	with my first little boy, I did gain a lot of weight,
B:	I got, I got about fifty pounds overweight with him
B:	and I didn't loose it until two years ago
B:	and then I got pregnant and, you know, ruined that,
B:	so
A:	Just have to start all over.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, actually, like I say, it ain't as bad this time, because I was in shape when I got pregnant.
A:	Right.
B:	I wasn't out of I wasn't overweight when I got pregnant with him,
B:	I just wasn't in, in shape.
B:	I don't know the difference
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	some people are a little bit fanatical about it.
A:	You know, I,
B:	About weight?
A:	Well yeah,
A:	and about, working out and fitness, you know,
B:	Exercise.
A:	I like to, to work out to look good and stay in shape
A:	and, you know, I know it's good for me,
A:	but people that live for it and, you know, eat a bunch of different pills, and, all that kind of stuff, it gets a little bit obsessive.
B:	Well that's what my friend did.
B:	Well, she was, she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else
B:	and really, we was, you know,
B:	even with her taking all those expensive vitamins and stuff, we stayed right on the same track with each other, you know, developing and everything.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Now there,
B:	you can take those, uh,
B:	what is it?
A:	Steroids.
B:	Steroids,
B:	yeah,
B:	I couldn't think,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's really bad for you.
B:	I was I was trying to say hemorrhoids,
B:	no,
B:	I was trying to say hormones.
A:	hormones.
B:	Yeah,
B:	hormones,
B:	but
B:	yeah,
B:	uh, steroids.
B:	But, I stay from that crap.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's too dangerous.
B:	Oh, I wouldn't, I could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I had a friend whose brother did steroids
A:	and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out.
A:	It all turned to fat
A:	and he just, really looked bad.
B:	Really.
B:	Ugh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I didn't know it did that.
A:	I don't know if it does to everybody,
A:	he was,
A:	it, just that's how it affected him.
A:	And he, I don't know, just,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I've been wanting to get me a bicycle, or a bike.
B:	I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around.
B:	I'm scared to run, for dogs.
B:	Course I know dogs can get you on a bike too,
B:	but, seems like it,
A:	Yeah.
A:	At least you got a chance to out run them that way.
B:	Yeah
A:	I don't like to run myself.
A:	I've thought about it several times
A:	and I just, it, I like to move a little faster and cover more ground.
B:	Well they,
B:	yeah,
B:	they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was.
A:	It's probably, I would think it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's real hard on your legs
B:	and it's hard on women.
B:	And it, it just makes stuff move down.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, but I, I, I like jogging,
B:	I don't mind that.
B:	I can get out and do that, as long as it's not hot.
A:	Uh, I can't.
B:	If it's hot, you can't do that.
B:	But in the rain, oh, I love to run in the rain,
B:	just, you know, be careful not to slide.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you.
A:	No,
A:	you can't,
A:	it's dangerous.
B:	You slide.
A:	At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could
A:	but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires, you slide all over the place.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, I, when I did ride my friend's bike, that one time, I had, uh, I don't know what I was trying to do.
B:	I was trying to make a U turn
B:	and I never could make a U turn in a bike,
B:	I can do it in my car,
B:	but I tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked
B:	and I told her a dog was chasing me
B:	But I wrecked it into the curb.
B:	I didn't hurt it too bad.
B:	I scratched it on the, the oh,
B:	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, I think.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But oh well.
B:	Anyway, it's been nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Well good luck with the, the new kid.
B:	Thank you,
B:	she's, it, she's good.
B:	Anyway, have fun exercising.
A:	All right.
B:	All right,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	All right.
A:	Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there?
B:	Um, we've got quite a few, actually.
B:	What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city.
A:	The, uh,
B:	Um, we've actually had some warnings in, uh, Raleigh uh, on air pollution.
A:	Oh, you mean for like smog and stuff?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	because of there so many cars,
B:	and we have a belt line around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, um, you know, it's still, it's just surrounding the city,
B:	and you can actually see it.
B:	There's a couple of, uh, tall buildings in Raleigh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and you can actually, you know,
B:	they're blurred,
B:	they're even dark,
B:	and what it is is the pollution.
A:	Huh.
A:	What do you think of that, uh, the greenhouse effect that's going on?
B:	Well I guess that's the fluorocarbons
A:	Yeah
B:	and, uh,
A:	that's causing the hole in the ozone.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's very serious.
B:	I mean, we can, we're even feeling the effects of the weather from, uh, uh, the shift in the jet stream.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It, it is scary though, isn't it?
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	I mean, uh, the last two, uh, years, our winters have been absolutely nothing.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean, maybe, one snow.
A:	Well, all right,
A:	North Carolina.
A:	That's up there by Kentucky, isn't it?
B:	Kentucky?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, North Carolina is all the way on the east coast.
A:	Okay.
B:	It's further west than Georgia,
B:	it's, uh, right below Virginia.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, Kentucky's next to Virginia, I'm pretty sure.
A:	Well, I'm from Kentucky,
A:	I should know
A:	but, I don't,
A:	I'm sorry.
A:	But Kentucky, we use to have severe, I mean, just real cold, cold winters
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we'd have three and four feet of snow.
A:	Course here in Texas they don't have snow,
A:	they don't know what snow is.
A:	They freak out when there's snow on the ground
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Originally I'm from Texas
B:	so, I mean Amarillo.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Oh, Amarillo?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that's close to here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	real close.
A:	How long have you been in Raleigh?
B:	Um, I've been out of Texas about ten years.
A:	Well, how old are you?
B:	Oh, twenty, uh, seven.
B:	I almost forgot my age.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, we're the same age.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I forget my age all the time,
A:	so that's okay.
A:	It's, I think it's just something that goes with the territory.
B:	Um
A:	But to me, Texas, see and Kentucky, we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school.
A:	Okay?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	In Texas, I'm serious, if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain, I, I swear they close everything down.
A:	I just laugh.
A:	I mean, I do,
A:	they get, I mean,
A:	and traffic slows down to nothing.
B:	Actually, they've been doing the same thing here.
B:	It's, you know, it's kind of funny,
B:	they, um, I guess northerners are different,
B:	but even, uh, North Carolinians, they don't know how to handle cold weather.
A:	Oh, well, no
A:	I'm from the north,
A:	that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we,
A:	I don't know,
A:	you just get used to the weather,
A:	and of course the people down in south, they they're not used to cold weather and stuff,
A:	and, uh, it just,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I just laugh
A:	every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground everything's closed up.
A:	And you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
B:	That's true.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Do you all have much pollution there?
A:	No,
A:	not really,
A:	I mean, not to see it.
A:	Now of course, there's, you know, T I is here, Oscar Mayer
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there is a few factories,
A:	but I don't see much pollution going on.
B:	Well, you know, what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe.
A:	Well, see, they have that, um, what is it a test, or something like that they call it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,  that's supposed to cut down on it.
B:	Well,
B:	supposedly that's supposed to catch it.
B:	But I'll tell you what,
B:	and even these buses, oh lord, it real bad. These buses in Raleigh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	school buses and the commercial buses,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	I mean, school buses are notorious.
A:	Well, they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, uh, it, it gets bad.
B:	Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that way it gets above, um, other cars on the road
A:	Well, that's a good idea.
B:	and, uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, you know,
B:	even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles,
B:	and, and, you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable.
B:	I would, I'd have to go out to the country to jog.
A:	Well, uh, the, you know, pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes.
B:	No,
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	When I was pregnant with my first little boy, I had read it,
A:	because back then because I was walking back and forth,
A:	well not back and forth,
A:	I was walking home from, uh, the college I was going to in Kentucky.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was having to walk along the highway.
A:	It was just one day a week.
A:	But it was, in,
A:	I, I have no sense of smell,
A:	so I couldn't smell this,
A:	but it would make me sick,
A:	and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway.
B:	Um.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Golly, that's, that's bad.
A:	But,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's,
A:	yeah,
A:	all the exhaust. Uh,
A:	well, that was four years ago, too,
A:	it's probably a lot worse now.
B:	Oh, I'm sure.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, they, um, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,
B:	and if you're older, um, I mean, you can really deplete your oxygen,
B:	and it'll, you know, pass out,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's, you know, it's killed several people.
A:	Do you, uh, smoke?
B:	Um, actually, I'm a very, I just smoke one in the evening if that.
B:	So, I'm a very, very light smoker.
A:	yeah,
A:	it's kind of
B:	It was kind of funny.
B:	They were doing some, uh, ozone testing, and, uh, the E P A
B:	and they were just screening some candidates,
B:	and I don't think I'd ever, you know, do that,
B:	but they, uh, asked me if I was a smoker,
B:	and I didn't fit into the smoker's category,
B:	and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. Um,
B:	it was, you know, I was just one of those
A:	Yeah,
A:	because you do smoke one a day.
B:	yeah,
B:	in between people.
B:	So that kind of threw them off.
A:	Um. Uh,
B:	But they're doing a lot of research here, uh, the E P A
A:	For the air pollution.
B:	For ozone, and oh, yeah, all that.
B:	They're, they're real big into it.
B:	They've got Research Triangle Park here,
B:	and they're, you know, they're just doing a lot of, uh, lot of stuff.
A:	Huh.
A:	But, they,
A:	I don't hear much about it down here.
A:	Course, Texas, we don't have a bunch of pollution.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	But, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And you know it'd blow it up north.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, no
A:	it would seem like it would be the same way in, on the California coastline, wouldn't it?
B:	Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I can't believe they have warnings here, which it, it's mainly just when it gets real, real hot.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially.
B:	Really?
B:	well that's kind of good to know,
B:	because I thought lord, I thought I lived in a halfway decent area.
A:	I think they do that for most everybody.
B:	Um.
A:	especially, it's usually for the young children and the older, the old people older old people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well you ought to come to North Carolina.
B:	It's a big change
A:	It is?
B:	Yeah.
B:	There was no trees where I was from, in Amarillo,
B:	and here they've got the mountains, the beach, the trees, you know,
B:	it's they've got streams, rivers, ponds,
A:	Oh.
B:	it's really pretty here.
A:	Oh, well, this is pretty wooded area down here
A:	so,
B:	Is it?
A:	in a lot of parts,
A:	yeah.
A:	I know Texas is supposed to be flat,
A:	but they've got, you know, down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sherman and Denison,
B:	do you know my grandparents live in Durant?
A:	They do?
B:	Yeah.
A:	They live close then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	real close.
B:	I go there,
A:	In Durant, Oklahoma?
B:	Yeah.
A:	You go where? Uh,
A:	you go to visit them?
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area.
A:	This,
A:	but, but Kentucky's beautiful.
A:	They've got trees,
A:	and trees are supposed to, you know, purify.
A:	You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff?
B:	huh-uh.
A:	It's a philodendron.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	It's supposed to filter the air for you, in your home.
B:	Well, I'm going to have to get some.
A:	I had one.
A:	My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months, four months ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you smoke?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do.
B:	Did you smoke when you, when you were pregnant?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I did.
A:	I couldn't make myself quit.
B:	Well.
A:	I did cut down a lot
B:	I mean I can understand that, actually.
A:	I got, I, I've got one vice
A:	and smoke is, smoking is it.
B:	Well,
A:	I don't, I don't drink,
A:	and I try not to cuss,
A:	and I do, I do very little,
A:	and smoking, I just, I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, one thing I miss is, uh, is the people from Texas, are, are, you know,
B:	I miss their morals, their values and everything.
B:	It's, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're down here at the Bible belt, aren't we?
A:	Uh, I wasn't saved until I got down here,
A:	and people down here are just,
A:	there's so many Christians,
A:	and it's so different from Kentucky
A:	but,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How'd you get involved in this research?
A:	Um, I worked at T I for a while,
A:	but then my brother-in-law works there,
A:	and he got me into it.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	Huh.
A:	How'd you get into it?
B:	Um, I, I was taking a voice I O class and, um, and actually doing some research,
B:	and so they told me about this project.
A:	Well, it's fun,
A:	I like talking to new people.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, half the time, well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl,
A:	I've had to hang up and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I enjoy it.
A:	I talked to people from, well, what, Carolina now up in, uh, Boston, and New York,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well Boston is New York, isn't it?
A:	No.
B:	Uh, no,
B:	Boston's above.
A:	Boston, Massachusetts
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I've talked to people in New York,
A:	but I've talked to a lot of people in Texas,
A:	because I guess, it's because T I down here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've talked to a lot of people in Texas.
B:	I had one call actually from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Virginia, and, um,
B:	I can't remember where all.
B:	From up north, like you said,
B:	I think one was from Boston.
A:	With Boston, I love their accent
A:	I do,
A:	I love the Boston accent.
A:	I met a girl from Boston one time.
A:	My husband was in the service,
A:	so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and his family's down here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We're out of the service now.
B:	Oh, I bet you're glad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he got out of it, his unit, right after Panama.
A:	We went to he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	And, uh, he ...
A:	Well, uh, it seems to me that, uh, that
A:	I do not know whether the jury system, uh,
A:	I, I should not say I do not know.
A:	I do not feel very, uh, stronger that the jury system should be changed.
A:	It seems to have worked, uh, time immemorial.
A:	And when, uh, difficult decisions, uh, are made, uh, uh, uh, they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I know in some cases now in some states, depending on the criminal code, uh, a unanimous verdict is not required.
A:	And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people,
A:	they are down to as little, as small as six people in, I think, in petty, in, in, uh, in, uh, in minor felonies, and, uh, and misdemeanor trials.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing, simply because, uh, there is always, uh, there is, there is always a jury that might be swayed, uh, by the moment, uh, to either to be too lenient or too vengeful, I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	On the other hand, uh, attorney, uh, uh, justices are more apt to, uh, understand, you know, the the prison crowding problems and things like that, and have that sway their decisions one way or the other. You know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, I mean, is not that, uh, is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world?
A:	If, if, if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences, and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons. Or even in, for that matter, uh, repair the, uh, the lack of judges and, and, and other, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think that is what is happening.
B:	I think, uh, the judges are trying to save the people from having to, the cost of new prisons.
A:	Yeah,
B:	They,
A:	yeah,
A:	you know, that might be it.
A:	I mean, they, they certainly,
B:	they are saying, oh, well, you know, the, the people cannot afford it.
A:	I do not, I don't know how it is in Virginia,
A:	but in Florida now, uh, uh, uh, at eighteen years, someone was just sentenced to eighteen years, I heard it on TODAY, uh, without any specific recommendation for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, waving the normal, uh, procedures.
A:	And the eighteen years will, uh, translate into something like, uh, four point seven, if every, if the, if the prisoner is a model prisoner,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and indeed the present overcrowding conditions, uh, prevail.
A:	Plus, I guess, there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial.
B:	Right.
A:	So, uh, yeah,
A:	you might be right about that.
A:	I, I, I do not know,
A:	it just seems to me that only about, uh, from what I read, only about ninety percent of the only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, only about, uh, four or five percent of, uh,
A:	in the, in the very end
A:	or less than, less than half the trials that go to, uh, less than half the cases that go to trial, uh, end up with, uh, with the jury actually making the verdict.
B:	With a conviction?
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	That most of it is plea bargained, uh, half way through
A:	or, or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, uh, how do you feel about the, uh, about the jury system itself?
A:	Do you, do you think that should be changed?
A:	Or do you, do you know in Virginia whether it is, if they have smaller juries
A:	or,
B:	Uh, I do not know exactly what the size of the juries.
B:	I know one of my friends was, uh, uh, brought up for jury duty.
A:	Yeah.
B:	For,
B:	and he only heard very, you know, piddly type cases.
B:	Most of it was, uh, robberies or things like that, you know,
B:	it was not any serious crimes.
B:	So apparently even for the smallest crimes, they give the person the, you know, any felony anyways.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess we,
B:	they give the person the option for a jury.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury.
A:	But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in, in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are, uh, are the result of some sort of a, uh, an action that you are bringing against someone else. You can ask for that to be heard before a jury.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Takes a heck of a long time, I guess, to get there in some states.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I, I do not know, uh,
A:	I should imagine Virginia, from what I read, uh, uh, is like every other state.
A:	It, it is faced with, uh, uh, enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system.
A:	Because I guess, everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Not that they won't appoint them
A:	but there is no budget for them, I guess.
A:	Or, and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk, uh, court clerks.
B:	Huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Whatever.
A:	So it seems, uh,
A:	no,
A:	I, I, I do not think I would change it.
A:	The more I verbalize it, I, I do not think I would want to change the system.
B:	Right,
A:	I do not know what we would replace it with
B:	uh, I do not think I would either.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know,
B:	it, uh, does seem like the, the, the, the purpose of getting people in jail so that, you know, the, the,
B:	I cannot think of the word I am looking for.
B:	Anyway, the deterrent. For people to, to commit the uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.
A:	Yes.
B:	People have,
B:	I do not know,
B:	they just do not care any more.
B:	The benefit, I guess, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is.
A:	Uh, and yet there are, there are so many, there are so many people in prison.
B:	You know, people that,
A:	I mean the prison population, uh, as far as I, I, uh, you know,
A:	my impression of it is that it has, that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty.
B:	Um.
A:	I mean it,
A:	so has our, I guess our population has grown some too.
A:	But there, there definitely is, uh, uh, you know, to me the, one of the worst things that could ever happen, uh, from what I read and see and understand.
A:	I mean I do no think I could handle prison.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean it would be very difficult,
B:	Well, I would be interested in finding out what the, uh, percentage of drug related type things are,
A:	Well, there must be a, a, a, a very great degree of that.
B:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, but there again I, I do not know if the, the jury system itself, uh, comes in to play there.
A:	I would think that,
A:	one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability,
A:	of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here, is the interviewing of jurors after the trial.
A:	I mean that, it seems to me that, that, that when a jury makes a decision, they should not be asked, uh, before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision.
A:	I mean, I do not,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I imagine there is a certain, certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that.
A:	But I, I would think I, if I did anything, I would protect the juror from, from any sort of an inquisition after
B:	Well, I know, uh,
B:	on the other hand though, when, after the Barry trial, up here, you know, the big local trial, as well as national.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, I do a lot of business up in Washington.
A:	I was there during the, during the trial actually,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And the opposite was true of me.
B:	Uh, after the case was over, I was like, somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did, you know
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	It was like, well, a picture is not good enough.
B:	We want to see,
B:	I do not know what they wanted honestly
B:	Did they want the guy to, I do not know. *qy but its' abandoned
B:	I mean, just because you feel like he was being kicked on, which he certainly was, you know.
B:	I think, I,
B:	no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted.
A:	Oh, I felt that way.
A:	I felt, I felt,
B:	But it does not matter.
B:	The guy was obviously guilty
A:	no,
A:	but,
A:	Yeah
A:	I always balanced in the, in the situation.
A:	I remember the jurors, uh,
A:	I thought to myself, how did, how did
A:	they only, I think they only, uh, found him guilty on one count. Which was, uh, not even, which was a class something felony. Which was not even punishable, uh, uh, to the degree that they thought it.
B:	One, one count.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I do not know,
A:	maybe when you are there in the in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody.
A:	And the prosecutors do a lousy job,
A:	or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it.
A:	I mean, I, I am not making excuses for
B:	Yeah.
A:	That might be it.
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	I think we are getting,
A:	I think I am getting a call coming in.
B:	Oh Okay.
A:	All right, nice talking with you.
B:	Well, it has been nice talking to you.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	What you mean, my voice?
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, no
A:	I am from Kentucky. Originally
B:	Oh, well.
A:	So,
B:	Well, the topic today was gardening, and lawn care?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh.
A:	I know,
A:	we are about to hit it in ten, few minutes.
A:	I figured I could make this call and get it over with.
A:	We are going to mow and trim and edge,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that is all we have been doing all weekend.
B:	You know what?
B:	It seems like we are doing it here forever.
B:	We bought a, a large house that was completely unlandscaped.
B:	I mean, it, it was probably was up to your shoulder in, in thistles.
B:	That was all that was there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we hired a professional landscaper to do it.
B:	And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted
B:	or the plants do not make the winter time.
B:	And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year, probably through the Fall too. And, uh, rip up, rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires, uh, more care than I am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, how many kids do you have?
B:	Just two,
A:	Okay.
B:	but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more.
A:	What year, I mean, how old are they?
B:	Four and five.
A:	Four and five.
A:	Goodness.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have got a four year, uh, a four year old and a four month old. And an eight year old stepdaughter.
B:	Oh, well, I have a twenty six year old stepson,
B:	and I do not know if that counts.
A:	Well, you do not have to tend to him.
B:	Well, I did for many years.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, you did.
A:	Okay.
A:	It is over with.
B:	Yeah.
A:	He is gone.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It is over with.
B:	Uh, back to gardening.
B:	Are you one of these, uh, Howard Garrett, organic enthusiasts or a, Neil Sperry, nuke the lawn with chemicals?
A:	If I can just nuke it, I would do it.
A:	But I do not.
A:	I just,
A:	it is like, oh, I will get out there and pull my weeds.
A:	I do not have a real big front yard.
A:	But I do have half of it is a flower bed, just about, all by the porch.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because the porch is pretty big,
A:	I live in town.
A:	But just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts.
A:	I do not like it.
A:	And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff.
A:	And I just plowed through the whole nine yards.
A:	Got up everything.
A:	There was some plants that are just Spring bloomers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I,
A:	the when the blooms died, the leaves were just horrible looking.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I just broke all them off.
A:	It was a hyacinth.
A:	Have you ever seen those?
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, they are pretty in the Spring
A:	But the leaves, I do not like them.
A:	You know, once,
B:	All right,
B:	now are you sure they are hyacinths?
B:	Because that is a bulb.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is a bulb.
B:	Well you should of just ripped the whole thing out.
A:	No,
A:	because I do like the, I like the plant in the Spring.
A:	I love those pink flowers.
A:	They are just pretty.
A:	So I just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. Because I want them to come back up next year.
B:	Have you had,
B:	is this the first year they have been up?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, let me tell you, they do not come back very well at all.
B:	Maybe they will if, up further north.
B:	But down,
B:	and you are not that much further north.
B:	I have probably planted oh, around here, um, maybe six hundred bulbs.
A:	Of hyacinths?
B:	No,
B:	I have probably have done hyacinths.
A:	Oh, of everything.
B:	But I have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming. Because they do not take the heat here.
B:	And if they do come back next year, they are going to look real puny.
A:	Oh, they will?
B:	Yep.
A:	Huh.
B:	About the only bloom, bulb that repeats well in my area is the, uh, uh, daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb.
A:	Okay.
A:	Now I have got some daffodils.
A:	And, everybody down here calls these flags. Uh, the irises I guess, uh,
B:	They call them flags?
A:	That is what they call them down here.
A:	They get, uh, just one bloom on the plant.
A:	I do not, I am not sure what they are called.
B:	When does it, when does it bloom?
A:	But I do not much,
A:	Well, I think they are stopped blooming now, in the Spring.
A:	It has got
B:	And what color?
A:	oh, they come in all different colors.
A:	The blooms are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white. Just all different colors.
B:	And you only get one of them?
A:	Well, I mean, per bulb.
A:	You get one big flower that looks like a lily.
A:	I do not know what they are called.
A:	I have always called them,
A:	well, I do not know what I have called them
A:	But when I come down here, everybody told me they are flags.
B:	You know what I bet you they are?
B:	And I am a pretty, I am a pretty good gardener
B:	because I have killed a lot of things here
B:	and, and I have planted a lot of them.
B:	And, and I work on a, uh, landscape committee for our neighborhood.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And our neighborhood is a planned development with, I think, it is seven hundred and fifty-five families.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we have about sixty acres that we have to plant.
B:	I am going to bet you that is a lily. Because it is,
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is some type of lily.
B:	And I will get, uh,
B:	is it,
B:	what color is, is yours blooming?
A:	I have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue. Which I would not, would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better. And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color. With little purple spots that it, it will fade into a solid purple.
B:	And what does the foliage look like?
B:	Does it fit that,
A:	Green spiky leaves.
A:	Now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a, a lot higher.
B:	Oh,
A:	And it is a bulb.
B:	oh, oh.
B:	Oh, I bet you those are, I bet you what those things are, uh, is a Dutch iris.
A:	Dutch irises.
B:	I bet you it is a Dutch iris.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Does it, does it on its little, on its, on the flower, does it have a beard on it at all? Any kind of fuzzies?
A:	You know, I, I really do not know.
B:	I am going to bet you that,
B:	that has got to be blooming this time of year.
B:	It has,
A:	No,
A:	they are, they have, they're died down. I am sorry, they are dead now.
B:	Well, I was just going to correct myself.
A:	They bloom in the Spring.
B:	Because they would have bloomed pretty early.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well,
A:	They bloomed in the Spring.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right about after the daffodils?
A:	Right about the same time or after.
B:	Okay.
B:	I will bet you those are Dutch iris.
A:	I would took, I took and just mowed over them last year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we have been,
A:	I, I do not much care for them.
A:	After the bloom dies, they are not pretty.
A:	And to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves.
B:	Well,
A:	But I took them out of my front yard,
A:	and I just threw them on the side, intending to transplant them or throw them away or something. And forgot about them through the whole Winter.
B:	Yep.
A:	Well, I went out there this Spring,
A:	and they had took root right where they were, on top of each other.
A:	And they told me that they are the hardest things to, you know, to kill.
B:	Well
A:	But they are real easy to grow.
B:	Ooh.
A:	Does that help?
B:	Well then it is not, it is not a Dutch iris then.
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	I do not, I am not sure what it is.
A:	They said that they are irises.
A:	It is some type of iris though.
B:	Huh.
A:	But they call them flags up here or down here, down here.
B:	Well, I am not so sure that Texans know what, what they have got.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do not know what it is.
A:	I am, I am not on, I am just getting into gardening this year.
B:	Did you just move down here?
A:	Uh, we moved here a year ago
A:	Yeah,
A:	last Spring.
A:	We moved in here May, this house, May of last year.
A:	So it was really too late to do much.
B:	Um. Who, who, who, who.
B:	Because I have got a flower, I have got, I have probably got, do, do, do, do, I do not know how many square feet it is, a big circular driveway.
B:	The whole, uh, perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds.
B:	And I am into that.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it, and it looks quite formal.
B:	I mean it really does,
B:	it looks quite formal.
A:	Well, that is,
B:	But it has been about three or four years of, uh, uh, playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here.
A:	Well, what kind of blue?
A:	I am wanting I want blue and purple and, you know, just different shades of that. Because my, my house is gray,
B:	You want blue?
A:	and blue looks so pretty against it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh, blue is hard, you know.
B:	Do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all Summer?
A:	I bought,
A:	well, I would like to have one that would bloom next year too.
A:	That will come back up.
B:	Okay.
B:	Put in a perennial blue salvia.
B:	Now it is going to grow about, um, the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it will send out a flower spike.
B:	You will see them blooming now.
B:	It is a wildflower here,
B:	but you can get them in the nursery.
A:	I am looking for a pen.
A:	I want to write this down because,
A:	well, that is where I went this year.
A:	Because I waited too late to really plant stuff.
A:	But I did not know that these hyacinths,
A:	like I said, I do not know anything about plants.
A:	I did not know the hyacinths were going to die.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	You are finding out who you are.
A:	But is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and, get homework done,
B:	Well, I think,
A:	and, you know, where do you find the time.
B:	Um. Well, in the first place it's not your homework,
B:	it's your children's homework.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I helped them with exactly what they asked for
B:	and that's all.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's a part of the problem that women have always had
B:	and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities.
A:	That's very true.
B:	They, They,
A:	And then that way, we have not changed in, hundreds of years, have we.
B:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That way husbands are crippled,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they are intellectual cripples,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so are children.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible, for themselves.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I do not know why God made women brilliant
B:	I,
A:	Didn't he though
B:	Yes,
B:	but I do not know
B:	they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems.
B:	They, are all things to all people,
A:	That's very true.
B:	and that's never changed.
A:	That's, that's very true.
A:	I, as a matter of fact I was talking to a friend yesterday, who said she has a new policy in her home
A:	and when her, her family comes to her and says, fix this, you know,
A:	I am having a problem with, you know, another member of the family,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she said I have taken a new stance,
A:	and I say, no,
A:	I will not.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, you work it out for yourself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she said, it's amazing, she said, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	every single person in this family expects me to get,
A:	and they suck me into these arguments and, these conversations
B:	That's right.
A:	and I I am supposed to be the one who is going to fix it all and, and soothe everybody.
A:	And she said I am not doing it anymore.
A:	I, I just,
B:	You know I think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful,
B:	and I think every woman ought to deal with it or, ought to at least be exposed to it,
B:	and that is mediation training.
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we are not talking about strikes or things
B:	we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises, parents and children, husbands and wives, uh, you know, boss and employee. Those kinds of things. Interpersonal mediation,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	because, the mediator is an unbiased bystander who,
A:	We're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis
A:	and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process.
B:	Well, not so much personally
B:	but my, um, husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother, I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such.
B:	They live down in College Station where, his parents do too.
B:	And they put her in a home last year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to, uh, not be able to be in her apartment on her own.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they found a, a place nearby that they put her in last year.
A:	So it was pretty much a physical decision?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	although she is, uh, in pretty good health and she's, doesn't take any medication,
B:	it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.
A:	Um.
B:	Then she was starting to get, uh, you know, lose memory sometimes and, which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh,
A:	My husband's family are reaching that point
A:	but it's, it's so difficult.
A:	Was she in favor of it
A:	or, or was she kind of opposed to it?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	when it finally came down to it, um, she just got to the point after the,
B:	I mean, it wasn't a very, um, strong stroke.
B:	It was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she got kind of fearful of being on her own.
B:	She never really ate very well.
B:	It was one thing.
B:	She hardly  ever took care of herself
A:	Yeah.
B:	and she didn't eat.
B:	She ate very poor
B:	so I think she was, you know, bad, uh, nutrition on top of it.
B:	And, uh, she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore.
B:	So,
A:	So often I think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad.
A:	I work with a lot of elderly people,
A:	I'm a trust officer
B:	Um.
A:	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
B:	Well, she was almost ridiculous.
B:	Like she'd eat ice cream and cookies.
B:	She'd,
A:	Yes.
A:	Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.
B:	Didn't one,
A:	It really is.
B:	Oh really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's too much trouble.
B:	That's too much trouble.
B:	Didn't want to cook.
A:	And the portions,
A:	people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals.
A:	I do that right now,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm not near nursing home age.
B:	Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels,  Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So as a family you all just visited nursing homes
A:	or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think there was. Um,
B:	I know a little bit more from a, a co-worker.
B:	Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, she was ambulatory
B:	and so there was a lesser care.
B:	Uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken
B:	and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory
B:	so they  were almost, you know, to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I remember from her checking around, she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh, a, uh, bathroom. All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	That's a given.
B:	They're always saying that somebody's going to,
B:	and some of them, I think unconsciously do it, you know,  as a just, you know, half
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And sometimes the, the help there does it, I think.
B:	Uh So, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. Very limited space waste
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room  and, and eat some good meals.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial.
B:	Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people
B:	but,
A:	Adapt.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't understand  that, they, they don't want to be with anybody else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business
A:	and I've seen so many elderly people.
A:	Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money
A:	but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and they do group things.
A:	And then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able to take the next steps without so much change
A:	and oh, I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in.
A:	It's really kind of difficult.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have a, um,
B:	my aunt's mother is, uh, gotten ill recently
B:	and, uh, she lives in Pennsylvania,
B:	they live in Alabama.
B:	And they're saying, hey, we need you to be closer
B:	and you have, women like that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't to men,
B:	it seems like the women out just out live their husbands, but, very reluctantly,
B:	that  whole, I mean
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they don't get out of the house,
B:	they don't socialize
B:	but it's my home
B:	and I don't want to leave it.
A:	Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.
B:	Uh.
A:	You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on
A:	and, and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
B:	Um.
A:	They, they became,
A:	in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother.
A:	She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision.
A:	And that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
B:	But it's, it's so lonely,
B:	you know they can't get out and see anyone
B:	and I mean, it's hard for, for someone like me to understand that
A:	Yeah.
B:	because I I think, what do you have there?
B:	It's a house,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's walls
B:	and it's furniture
B:	but  there's nobody there.
A:	Not as independence.
B:	Don't you want to be close to me? I mean, you know  be with other people.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just don't understand why they, so much want to just stay in  that building.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there's no family there,
B:	they don't get to see their grandkids,
B:	they don't get to see their children,
B:	they just there in that house.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And the quality of life really isn't there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh it's tough,
A:	it really is.
B:	That's from the child's standpoint.
B:	The child is going, why don't you want to be close to me and your other family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What does that house got attraction?
A:	Well, they fear being dependent  on somebody.
B:	I know they're really proud of independence.
A:	They, they fear being a burden to, to family members.
B:	Uh.
A:	My husband's mother will have major surgery
A:	and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation.
A:	She'll let something slip
A:	and we'll say, wait a minute.
A:	And, and that's it,
A:	she, just, well
A:	I didn't want to bother you.
A:	She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
B:	Well, when she got home, who took care of her?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, she stayed, she stayed in a temporary nursing home.  Until she was okay.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know, it's just,
A:	but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her.
A:	She's down in Temple
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
B:	Um
A:	So, it's difficult,
A:	it really is
A:	and we're all heading that way
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	my, husband and I, we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station
B:	and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area
B:	and there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
A:	Yeah
A:	Okay.
A:	We're talking about capital punishment.
B:	Right.
A:	How do you feel about that Lenore ?
B:	I am very much for capital punishment.
A:	Well, wonderful.
A:	I am too, one hundred percent.
B:	My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've been raised around prison prisons all my life.
A:	All your life.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime, there's not any deterrent
A:	There's no deterrent.
A:	That's right.
A:	There's just no deterrent.
B:	That's right.
A:	And so many of those kind of people, they got, they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway
A:	so, you know, unless they really make it rough on them that's not a, going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I don't think.
B:	Especially not a federal prison.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I don't know what Oklahoma's laws are
A:	but Texas's I don't know are,
A:	I don't know
A:	it's, it's no one's
A:	I mean it's not the judge's fault I don't think.
A:	It's just the way the law is down here.
A:	Man our our, uh, prisons are so crowded that, uh, they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two.
B:	Well, see we were under, uh, the state's prisons were under a mandate to, uh,
B:	it was over crowded
B:	and the federal came in and said, hey, you know, you have either got to build more prisons or let people go.
A:	Well, that's what ours did, same thing.
B:	And finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said, okay, where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose. Under early bail, you know or early, uh get out.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, we have,
B:	the death penalty is not given often.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But there have been
A:	It's not here either really.
B:	And you know, I,
B:	maybe it should be, uh, well, it should be given, you know, I, I won't say sparingly,
B:	but I do believe it should be befitting the crime.
A:	I do too
A:	and, and you know, but the way the courts are set up they've, they've got so many chances for appeal,
A:	but I think I think it needs to be expedited.
A:	You know if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of, of a crime that's deserving of, of a lethal injection, let's do it and not waste so many years to do it.
B:	Right.
B:	Of course, you know, they're, they're entitled to a speedy trial.
A:	That's right.
B:	But then they're, they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So somehow, you know, it doesn't really balance out too much.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's right.
A:	Somehow it just doesn't,
A:	it works and then again it takes too long for it to work.
B:	And it seems even though, you know, that they got ,
B:	the prisoner himself can come to the point that, hey, I'm tired.
B:	I just want out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I'm tired of fighting it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then the system just keeps on.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it
B:	And at that point you know I, I really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process.
A:	I do too.
A:	I think that needs to,
A:	and I don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably.
A:	But, you know
B:	Well, part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.
A:	that's true.
A:	It is overcrowded because there's so much drug, uh, problem with the people on drugs
A:	because that
A:	they, with the drugs they're, they're robbing and killing
A:	and, uh, that's why it's filled the prisons up so much I think.
B:	Uh, it doesn't, it doesn't help them any at all
A:	No,
A:	it doesn't.
B:	and, of course, your court system when you get into the appeals,
B:	I don't believe criminal is in a court by itself.
B:	And the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	With all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things
A:	but,
B:	We've gotten into a very litigious, uh, type of life.
A:	Boy, haven't that we though.
A:	We really have.
A:	But anyway I'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment.
B:	Well, I just,
A:	I'm, I'm very muchly for it.
A:	Always have been,
A:	always will be.
B:	I just feel like their crime and punishment
B:	and if, if you don't have the punishment, you double your crime.
B:	And the, you know, that is just personal feeling.
B:	It's not going on facts.
B:	I think the facts would probably back it up
A:	It could be supportive.
A:	It, it's it's supported with facts though.
B:	but,
B:	What?
A:	It could very easily be supported with facts.
B:	Well, yes.
B:	I,
A:	Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.
B:	Well, um, I have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever
A:	Okay. where do you go camping at around here?
B:	and, uh, I enjoy camping.
B:	I,
B:	we we have a tent,
B:	and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,
B:	I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death
B:	We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.
B:	Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,
B:	we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April is when we went,
A:	Okay.
B:	and, and it got really cold at night,
B:	and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning,
A:	Sure.
B:	but,
A:	Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?
B:	Oh, we take little nature hikes
B:	and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.
B:	Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that sounds like fun.
A:	I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills
B:	Oh.
A:	and so we used to go camping,
A:	my dad would take us,
A:	there was, there was four of us kids,
A:	we'd, he'd take us,
A:	and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,
A:	and it was always fun, uh,
A:	because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot
A:	and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,
A:	and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,
A:	and hopefully we'd catch our supper,
A:	but we never did
B:	Um.
A:	but it was, it was always fun.
A:	We'd always,
A:	Mom was always prepared
A:	and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,
A:	so we always had, something along to eat,
A:	but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,
A:	and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.
A:	Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,
A:	I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,
A:	and, uh, there's no hills,
A:	it's flat,
A:	and then I was in high school,
A:	and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,
A:	but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,
A:	but, it, it was always fun.
A:	It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, in the hills we, we would do like you you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,
A:	and we always, you know,
A:	in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,
A:	but,
B:	Uh,
A:	Go ahead.
B:	We used to live in Utah
A:	Okay.
B:	and, uh, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff.
B:	That's, that's a great place to go camping,
B:	and the hiking is just really great.
B:	You know, hike up those mountains is just really fantastic. Um.
A:	Sure.
A:	Now is there anything, uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area.
B:	I'm not acquainted with any, you know,
B:	I,
B:	there's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area, you know,
A:	Okay.
B:	there's a Tyler State Park that's, uh, really a nice camping area,
B:	but it, it's just a lot of trees,
B:	it's not,
B:	I don't know of any place in Texas that has, uh, really big, you know, what I call mountains
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I,
B:	The Rocky Mountains are so much, uh, bigger than anything that they've they've got down here that,
A:	Right.
A:	Is the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose?
B:	No,
B:	it's not, well, it's not too bad.
B:	They have, um, screened in areas, you know,
B:	they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say,
B:	I guess they could call them that, but they're, they're more just a screened in, uh, camping area whatever,
A:	Okay.
B:	they're, they're not bad.
A:	Helps, helps keep the, the pests out, I suppose.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	Well, that sounds,
A:	I don't know if I can rate camping,
A:	but, you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to to find a mountain, I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
B:	I, I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area.
A:	No,
A:	we just moved down in, in June.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	Well, you're still, uh, you're just trying to get over the culture shock still
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm still trying to find my way around.
A:	I, if I can get on Central from anywhere, I'm happy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall.
A:	Okay.
B:	It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly,
B:	I mean, there's, there's a lot,
A:	Okay.
A:	What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day?
B:	Um, huh. Well, I don't like it when, uh, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room or when people like look through my things in my bedroom
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's right.
A:	That is really an invasion of privacy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly, the solicitors, and the carpet cleaning companies and,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Does that happen in your part of the country?
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, uh, I come home
B:	Definitely.
A:	and I am trying to get a few things done
A:	and I can't do anything but answer the telephone.
B:	Right
A:	Some evenings are worse than others,
A:	but I wish I could put a stop to it,
A:	but I don't know what to do to stop it.
B:	Right.
B:	Even, uh, we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting,
B:	and they would still come to our door and knock and
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They would think it didn't mean them, I guess.
B:	I guess not,
B:	no.
A:	Everybody but me
B:	Yeah
A:	Oh, goodness.
A:	Are you do you live at home with your parents?
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family.
B:	Yeah,
B:	mostly.
B:	Yeah
A:	Now what can you do to stop that?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
B:	Well, I am used to it now,
B:	but sometimes it sort of gets, gets to me
B:	but there is not much I can really do.
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	Just have to live with it, I guess.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Try to remember to respect their privacy,
A:	and maybe they will respect yours
A:	and,
B:	Well, I don't know
B:	I always,
A:	Do you have brothers?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	yes,
B:	I do,
B:	but they don't live at home.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I was
A:	I had two younger brothers,
A:	and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations
A:	and,
B:	Oh, I used to do that though because I was the youngest,
B:	I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs
B:	But I,
A:	I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me,
A:	and then they would go get on the other extension
B:	Oh.
A:	and I could hear them,
A:	but I couldn't get them to hang up, you know.
B:	Yeah
B:	But I stopped doing that a long time ago,
B:	and they still do it to me.
A:	Even it, in the office I, uh, find that people walk up and, and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy, they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up.
B:	Oh, like,
B:	yeah,
B:	this lady does that to me at work when I'm taking an order or something,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she'll just sit there and listen like I'm doing something wrong,
B:	and she just started
B:	and, she is nice
B:	but.
B:	to someone in the Okay.
B:	But, you know, it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Let's see, I can't think of anything else I'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors.
B:	No
A:	About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so. But,
A:	And I guess that's really the thing that really bugs me the most.
A:	I can't think,
A:	our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me,
A:	but they've all gotten grown up now
B:	Uh,
A:	and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me, since mine are all grown up,
B:	Oh
A:	but. What else would be an annoyance?
A:	Well, I guess traffic could be an annoyance.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Especially when you're in a hurry
A:	Do you have a lot of traffic in your area?
B:	Um, it can get busy,
B:	yeah.
B:	Usually in the week I'm .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some days it's real, real bad here,
A:	and you would like to, feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've traveled quiet a bit,
B:	and I've been through Dallas, Texas.
B:	It's pretty busy
A:	It really is,
A:	and pretty noisy.
B:	Yeah
A:	It really is.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I live right on a main thoroughfare,
A:	so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy
A:	because it, at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night you know, when you go to bed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And every time a, a fire truck or anything went down the road, I would wake up,
A:	but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I suppose you do.
A:	And, uh, I just close it out, I guess, because I don't, I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me
B:	Yeah.
B:	I am a real solid sleeper though
B:	so that probably wouldn't bother me.
B:	I'd sleep right through it
A:	They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It takes a lot.
A:	Let's see. What else is an invasion?
B:	I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time
A:	Oh.
B:	I was mad because those were mine ,
A:	Well, did you have has name all over them?
B:	No
B:	It was a, a letter from a girlfriend of mine.
B:	I, I just, I was upset because those were mine,
B:	and, you know, I thought he,
A:	That was yours.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	I thought he would respect me more than that, to look through my things and not trust me,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so that was upsetting.
B:	I was mad about that and my privacy there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, well, I guess social change takes in a, a big category,
A:	but, uh, I guess the, the one aspect of it that I took in, uh, consideration is more economical.
B:	Um.
A:	I, I know that the amount of, or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has, has greatly changed.
B:	Yes,
B:	I agree.
A:	I know, they, they did a,
A:	it was on a talk show,
A:	they took, uh, the parents and then the, uh, the son,
A:	and they compared income at different points in time when the, when the father was, you know, was a little bit younger and more in his heyday
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, and they compared to the son's, that he was making now.
A:	And even though the son was probably more successful, you know, higher up in the, the management ladder uh, his, he was actually making less money when you when you go by costs of living.
B:	Right.
B:	Um.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	And it's depending on where you live, though, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know just, uh, just with me, ten years ago, I was comparing the,
A:	I think I, I was living better ten years ago than I am now, even though I'm making more money now,
A:	but my dollar went a lot farther.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	Ten years ago I was eleven
B:	Oh. I remember though, like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now. And gas,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I used to hear stories from my Grandpa,
B:	and, you know, he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I, I know gas prices have definitely jumped, uh, from, uh,
A:	I know I used to pay twenty-five cents a gallon
A:	and now it's over a buck.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know what it's, uh, by you.
A:	Around here Minnesota, Wisconsin area it's, uh, it's dropping,
A:	but I think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm from Wisconsin,
B:	yeah, .
A:	Okay.
A:	Well that's, uh, that's
A:	most of the people I talk to are Texas,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I spoke to a person from Texas, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	This is only my second phone call
B:	so I'm waiting for mine.
A:	Oh.
A:	I suppose this will be one of my, towards my last one pretty soon,
A:	so they'll stop me
B:	Um.
A:	but, uh, I'm, uh, I'm pretty much out to the things to say.
B:	Oh, like, like social changes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, um, and I don't think this would have anything to do with it,
B:	but like clothing and styles, lot of those changed.
A:	Okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, I, I don't think they, they consider,
A:	like I say, it's a broad category,
A:	it's just I'm not economical
A:	but uh, even attitudes on, on clothing and stuff, uh, I know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	definitely.
B:	Towards each other.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I know a lot of the things that, that we wear, men wear nowadays were, would have been considered, uh, feminine, uh, many years ago,
A:	but. I know, it's been, it was hard for me at first,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	but now I kind of like, you know, a lot of the bright colors.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, like I used to be more, uh, conservative and just your basic colors,
A:	but now I, I do like some of these, uh, brighter, fluorescent colors.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but they, styles come and go all the time, though.
B:	It's just ridiculous, fads in and out.
B:	And even, um, clothing from the sixties came back.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I see a lot of, um, girls wearing sixties clothes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, I guess the, the best thing I like to see from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course One of the nice things,
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I don't think that there's anything as original,
A:	it's, it's all based on, uh, one of the past styles,
A:	they just, um, make their, uh, circle and come back again.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So if you hang onto your clothes long enough, uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years
B:	Yeah
B:	That's true,
B:	maybe some day I probably won't be alive to see it,
B:	but prices might go down lot more.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know though,
B:	doesn't look good.
A:	Well, I think, thinking back, I think the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I remember that,
B:	I do
A:	I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say God.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I didn't really care for them either
B:	But now I,
A:	I was going to say, my, uh, college is Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota,
A:	and our head football coach, Dennis Muir used to be an assistant coach at B Y U.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	So I thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence.
B:	Huh
B:	So you went to what college?
A:	Uh, Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
B:	And what did you graduate in?
A:	I
A:	in what major or what year?
B:	Yeah,
B:	major
A:	International business.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And you?
B:	I'm going to B Y U,
B:	and I'm going into nursing
A:	Okay.
B:	so.
A:	Well, that sounds interesting.
A:	How long of a program is that?
B:	Forever
B:	Seems like, anyways.
B:	It's about five years,
B:	but it's probably going to take me longer, because I didn't decide to major in that until, uh, about a year and a half after I was already in school,
B:	so.
A:	You know, I read a study once,
A:	and it said that, uh, like thirty-four percent of, uh, college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	That sounds.
A:	It took me, it took me five years.
B:	Yeah
A:	So, you just, you get started
A:	and you change your mind,
A:	or you want to pick up a second major,
A:	if you're management, you, you, thought, I, I'll take that marketing,
A:	it's just only was three more classes you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you, just doesn't happen that you get out in four years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But.
B:	So what is your advice to picking a college.
A:	My advice is is, uh, look for, at the student to faculty ratio, you know,
A:	if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one, I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that, what was yours more like?
A:	Yeah
B:	Was there a,
A:	it was about twenty-six to one.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Which is, you know,
A:	it, it's interesting,
A:	but it, it's
A:	what I thought was nice is you could there was always time to talk to professor, you know,
A:	and, and they knew you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You weren't just in their class, you know,
A:	and so you could, you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time,
A:	and, or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever, you know, you could sit down, talk to them about a problem.
A:	They're always willing to help you out.
A:	So, but I, I's, I, I put that against, uh, my high school where we had, uh, a biology class of three hundred and fifty students
A:	and.
B:	Wow, in high school?
A:	Yeah
B:	Oh.
A:	it was a biology lecture class
B:	Wow.
A:	and, you know, it, it just wasn't the same.
A:	You're sitting there,
A:	and you're taking notes
A:	and, you know, you got a computerized test scores, multiple choice, because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test uh, you know, a three hundred fifty person short answer test.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, it just wasn't the same.
A:	You, you'd run, you'd pass the teacher in high school
A:	and, even in high school you could say high to your teachers, unless you're in that biology class,
A:	and they just, they'd look at you like, do I know you?
A:	or should I know you?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's, it's,
B:	the classes here are pretty big,
B:	so, it's hard to get individual help
B:	It's kind of, you're on your own
A:	Do you get, uh, a lot of tutoring,
A:	or.
B:	No
B:	Very little, I mean,
B:	well, like my,
B:	for example, I have, I'm in a chemistry class right now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there's tons of students in it,
B:	and there's one T A for the whole class.
B:	And he only has certain office hours,
B:	and so there's only certain times you can talk to him,
B:	and.
A:	And you could get there
A:	and his office hours could, I mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him,
A:	and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college?
B:	Oh, man. I think your advice is good.
B:	Um let's see. My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college
A:	That's excellent advice.
B:	because I, I didn't,
B:	and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to,
B:	and, um, I don't know,
B:	I just feel like I'm, it's, it's going to take me a lot longer than,
B:	and not that's always bad,
B:	but it's,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it's frustrating, I guess.
A:	Well, it, it, it does get it.
A:	You know, you get to the point where it's, I'm never going to get done.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, I, I mean, I was taking summer classes
A:	and let me get out of here.
B:	Yep.
A:	But, uh, no,
A:	that's good advice.
A:	Even if you don't have your major decided on, have an idea what you think you might want, you know,
A:	so you don't want management,
A:	but you think you want business,
B:	Yes.
A:	I haven't, uh, talked to anybody outside the Metroplex,
A:	so I didn't even think of saying Arlington, Texas.
A:	This is a real first
B:	Yes.
A:	Are you at work?
B:	Yes,
B:	I am.
A:	I, I, I've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening
A:	and I thought, well, I'm not having any luck,
A:	I'll try the middle of the afternoon.
B:	Well, I'm, I'm happy we got through.
A:	I am, too.
A:	Well, do you have any, uh, opinion on the subject?
B:	Well, I'm, I'm especially interested with what, what's happening in the Soviet Union, uh,
B:	the, the move to, uh the, the, the, Ukraine's vote to, uh, basically to secede and set itself up independently uh, is quite a remarkable, counts,
A:	Democracy.
A:	Oh.
B:	is that, is that reported in the Texas papers?
A:	Oh, sure,
A:	we, uh, we hear a little of the news Uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I have heard about that the last couple of days.
A:	How, how big is the Ukraine, the area,
A:	do you know?
B:	Uh, as an area, it's not,
A:	Or a population or anything,
A:	I'm really uninformed.
B:	I, I'm afraid I don't have the statistics in front of me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a, it's not a tiny area. Uh,
B:	if I was looking at a U S map, I would say it was sort of reminds me of, of a, uh,
B:	it's not as big as California proportionately.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, but, but it's, it's more significant, in the sense of, it's a great agricultural region.
A:	Oh, I see,
A:	oh, I, I didn't really know that,
A:	I know a lot of their, oh, their countries that they had overtaken, or wanted to be independent or several of them, right,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, what about Astonia,
A:	are they,
B:	They're completely out now.
A:	Right,
A:	I thought they were.
B:	Yes,
B:	the three, the three Baltic, uh, republics got out as quickly as they could.
A:	But, but, the, the Ukraine is especially significant because it, of the agriculture?
B:	Right,
B:	it's, it's very important for the economics of the whole, of the Soviet Union.
A:	Uh, so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could.
B:	Right, uh,
B:	except they can't fight
A:	No,
A:	they don't,
B:	It's done democratically, uh,
A:	And Bush has already given his opinion on it, right?
B:	Yes.
A:	Didn't I read that?
B:	Yes.
A:	So, now, uh, not that they may, that may matter,
A:	I don't know, anymore.
A:	I, uh, fear for the Russians from what I read, you know,
A:	I wonder how they're going to get through the winter. Food wise or any wise,
B:	Uh,
A:	sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon, or not that that would do any good,
A:	but I guess people do that when they're desperate.
B:	That, that's true, uh, hasn't happened here for a while,
B:	but it, uh,
A:	Well, that's true,
A:	since the Depression,
A:	I guess when the veterans went to Washington
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and well, you know, the war riots, of course.
A:	Let's just hope we don't get to that point
A:	Things are not so good in Texas job wise.
B:	No,
B:	I've, I've heard they're, I hear you have some problems.
A:	Well, we do.
A:	We have lots and lots of, uh, layoffs here. Lot of companies folding, lot of layoffs
A:	and it's pretty scary.
B:	Do, do you, do you blame the, the government in Washington for this?
A:	Well, I don't understand economics that well.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I, I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so I assume that that has some effect. Or a great effect.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I do, uh, I mean, they said during the way, Reagan-Bush years, the rich got richer,
A:	the poor got poorer,
A:	the statistics prove that
A:	so, uh, I, I guess,
B:	So then, you think it's, it's, you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this
B:	or is it just coincidence it was during this period?
A:	Well, I really don't know.
A:	I think maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.
A:	Maybe they should pay more attention to these trade, or, you know, to the more equalization of the trade.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, if somebody in, in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions, well, I don't know what's going to happen then.
B:	Oh, the Chinese use slave labor, too.
A:	Right.
B:	That's, that's one of the ways they get away with it.
A:	And child labor.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	What do you think has caused our horrible situation?
B:	Uh, I don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing.
A:	One thing.
B:	I mean it's, that's very complicated.
A:	Right,
A:	well, they say, too, that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good.
A:	I mean, I've read that is a theory.
B:	So which one are we going to throw out?
A:	Well, I hate to say it,
A:	but, I, I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	Texas, Texas used to be a democratic state, didn't it?
A:	Oh, I know,
A:	it used to,
A:	right.
A:	Well, you don't want too many democrats anymore
A:	and for a while I kind of deserted the party,
A:	but now it's looking better to me.
B:	I like your governor.
A:	Oh, do you?
A:	Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
B:	She's an impressive woman.
A:	Well, I think so, too.
A:	I, I just, admire her a lot.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I I really hope she does well.
A:	But she's, uh, you know, probably more popular out of the state than she is here, although she did manage to win.
B:	Right
A:	But look who she was running against, you know
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	anybody could beat Claytie in Texas.
A:	He shot himself in the foot so many times
A:	How did you get on this T I thing?
B:	Oh, I, I know some of the people.
A:	Okay,
A:	go ahead.
B:	Well, I, I, uh, we're going to compare notes. Uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh, I  often desire to exercise, often believe I should and rarely do.
A:	Don't do it
A:	Well, I tell you, I, I firmly believe in exercising.
A:	I think it's a,
A:	I do it every day on a regular basis.
A:	I,
B:	What, what, what sort of, of regiment do you have?
A:	Well, I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles,
A:	but this time of year, you can't get much biking in. Uh,
A:	but every morning I use this President's, uh, council of physical fitness
A:	and it really is, uh, uh, it's worth doing,
A:	and you can do it anywhere.
A:	I, I travel quite a bit in my in my business,
B:	Yes.
A:	and you can do it, you know, wherever you're at
A:	and if you do it,
A:	I, I do it every morning after, uh, usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get, you know, dressed going you know, to go to work.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, now what I do,
A:	I mean, I've done this for, you know, like fifteen years,
A:	so you don't start at this kind of regiment, you know.
B:	Yes.
A:	I,
A:	so, what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do
A:	and, and you'll hurt yourself Uh,
A:	every, every, uh,
A:	it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time,
A:	but I, uh, I do twenty-five, uh, uh, where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch right, you know, left and right toe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I do, uh, ten, uh, right and left, uh, trunk twisters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I do, uh, about sixty, uh, bicycle, type, uh, leg thrust type things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I do, uh, twenty, uh, leg lifters on each side. You know when you're laying on the floor.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
B:	Right.
A:	And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups
A:	and, uh, then I do about, uh,
B:	My goodness,
B:	you do all of this in fifteen minutes?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	oh, yeah.
A:	And then, uh, thirty, uh,
A:	now if you did football, like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, prone type things, where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing,
A:	and that takes about, really about, maybe about thirteen minutes, uh in the morning.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Now what, what keeps you doing that.
B:	I mean, I, I sometimes start little, much less, much more modest efforts,
B:	but I give up,
B:	I just find them boring.
B:	Hard to find the time for it on a given day
A:	Well, uh,
B:	and,
A:	Years ago I used to, uh, referee football
B:	Yes.
A:	and, uh, to stay in condition, I did that, uh, just as a normal  basis,
B:	Yes.
A:	and, uh, uh, I tell you just by doing it, uh,
A:	well, example, this summer I, I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be
A:	so I, I increased,
A:	I do three hundred sit ups a day now, but not at that, in the morning,
A:	I do a hundred then
A:	and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
B:	Yes.
A:	and, you know, you can eat anything you want, drink anything you want,
A:	but you don't, you know,
A:	within reason, you know, you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yep.
A:	and, uh, I just, you know,
A:	you're ready to go at a,
A:	I, I, I think it's really important.
B:	Well, I, I, whenever I do it, I feel good. I mean good that I have done, good because it's, it seems right and good because it has good effects.
A:	Good.
B:	But, but it's this maintaining a, a regular habit that I just can't seem to do.
A:	Well, that's why Chuck, I think, uh, if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things, you know, where you can make excuses like,
B:	Yeah.
A:	well, I, I like biking
A:	and during the summer, I'll do, you know, at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but you can't, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	there's excuses, weather
B:	Yep.
A:	or you don't have time or something like that.
A:	But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour. And you get up a half hour earlier
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and once you start getting into that, one, you just feel good
B:	Yes.
A:	and you look a whole lot better.
B:	Yes.
B:	Do you, do you does your wife participate in any of this
B:	or,
A:	Unfortunately not,
A:	and there's no way I can get her to.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's a, like it's something you either just really want to do it
A:	or you can't talk anyone into it.
A:	If you don't like to exercise, you know, it isn't going to happen.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	I, I sure wish she would.
A:	She's, you know, unfortunately overweight,
A:	and, but she's a wonderful woman
A:	and you know, no sense getting in arguments with anybody, about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well I, I, uh, I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me, I, that would be, little bit of peer pressure would help considerably.
A:	Well,
B:	But you seemed to have solved that problem without any, any external help.
A:	No problem at all.
A:	And, uh, if you get one of these mats. You know, go to a store, they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C of physical fitness on them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year
A:	and, uh,
B:	What, what, what, what's on, what's this mat, I mean,
A:	It, it, it's just an exercise mat that rolls up
A:	so you can put it up, you know, just in the corner.
B:	Is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip  and sleep on it.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	you can do that.
B:	I mean, it's that, it's that kind of like  half inch of foam or something.
A:	But, but it doesn't,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a foam thing,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's, it's just about six feet long, rolls up
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I don't take it on trips with me.
A:	I, you could,
A:	but, uh, I don't mind, uh, you know,
A:	if I do like sit ups, I'll throw a, a towel down or something. You know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so you don't have the abrasive,
A:	Okay,
A:	what do you think about, uh, the self insurance business?
B:	Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, uh, General, ex, uh, Surgeon General Koop.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he talked about Canada's system
B:	and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,
B:	but the expensive stuff, heart, uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.
B:	And they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in San Francisco.
B:	So in one city of, in America, there's as many, uh, hospitals that are equipped to do uh, heart operations as in the entire area of Canada,
B:	and that's kind of spooky.
A:	Well, I, uh, I understand what you're saying,
A:	and there's probably some truth to that.
A:	I think that, uh, generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities.
A:	However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession, it eventually leads to that,
A:	and I think the costs and the, uh, the way the medical profession has, every year
A:	I, being in my own business, uh,
A:	in the last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs,
A:	and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think they're asking for it.
A:	I, I think the medical profession is just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over
A:	and, uh,
B:	Do you think that it's just, uh, medical guys?
B:	What about, you know, you know how expensive new equipment and technology is.
B:	That's where I think most of the cost is coming.
A:	Well, I, I think a lot of it is, uh,
A:	I, I don't disagree totally with that,
A:	but, uh, my wife this last summer, uh, when we were on vacation tore up her knee,
A:	and, uh, uh, it was ligaments, uh, in her knee,  as it turned out, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she came back that, uh,
A:	we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened
A:	and, uh, she got home,
A:	and the leading orthopedic man, who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come,
A:	I mean, he knows knee problems okay,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it.
A:	Well, she goes in,
A:	he says, well, I think this is what it is,
A:	but, uh, you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things.
A:	A thousand dollars for this, uh, oh, magnetic, uh, resonance imaging type thing.
A:	And my wife said, well, do I need that?
A:	And he says, well, uh, you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this.
A:	I mean, uh, you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing.
A:	Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital.
A:	Now, a,  thousand, uh, uh, dollars for thirty-five minutes.
B:	Oh, great.
A:	I mean, doctors routinely send people in for anything.
A:	Now, for years they didn't have this
A:	and they solved these problems,
A:	and, you know,
B:	Yeah .
A:	I said to her, well, look, you know, if you feel you got to go, go,
A:	but I, I think a thousand dollars,
A:	these guys,
A:	I don't know what it is,
A:	but there's,  no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day.
B:	Uh-huh .
A:	And even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at, uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, uh, that's ridiculous.
A:	I, I don't care what anyone says.
A:	You know, the costs are not,
A:	it's a picture.
A:	It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that, you know, reasonableness.
A:	But they aren't reasonable.
A:	Fifty, a hundred dollars.
A:	They don't have to pay them back in three months time.
B:	No.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'll have to agree,  with you there,
A:	You know .
B:	but there's another problem,
B:	and that's the, how litigious our society is.
B:	If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court.
A:	Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem,
A:	but that's part of our legalese problem.
A:	And that, the government eventually will address too just, you know, because it's out of control.
A:	I, I agree with you.
A:	You know, uh, I was on a jury
A:	or I, I didn't make the jury,
A:	but there was a, deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like it was three days after it was born,
A:	and he was the one that delivered it.
A:	And they got four attorneys,
A:	one guy out of Houston, he introduced himself as snake so-and-so,
A:	and he says, well, anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars,
A:	and I says, yeah,
A:	I got problems with
A:	I mean, you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back, you know,
A:	I mean, as sorrowful as it is. Uh, you know, if the doctor is wrong, you know, he should be pulled from his license,
A:	but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, you know,
A:	it, it doesn't make logical sense to me,
A:	but, uh,
B:	No,
B:	it doesn't.
A:	Uh, that's,
B:	You think about AIDS research?
A:	Well, AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,
A:	and you die from it.
A:	So I think that, uh, they need to look into it
A:	and it's kind of like cancer.
A:	I don't, you know,
A:	how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think it'll probably be as difficult.
A:	Uh, how about yourself.
B:	Um, well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,
B:	and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.
B:	I think that
B:	because, besides the fact that it's a deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's, um,
B:	although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they say a million people are infected with the H I V virus,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, yeah,
A:	I think,
B:	That's in the world, or in America?
B:	You,
A:	Uh, in the country, America.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah
B:	Um, that's,
A:	and they have millions.
B:	Whose figure is that?
A:	I don't know.
A:	I've just heard it on the radio.
B:	Okay.
A:	Sometimes you hear things that, on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, do you feel like this is,
A:	I, I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you think they should spend more?
B:	Uh, I, I think they should, actually, although perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing,
B:	and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.
B:	I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.
A:	What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?
B:	Um well, I, well, I am sorry that he has the virus.
A:	Magic?
B:	I, um, I don't know,
B:	I don't, I think it's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people.
A:	Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?
B:	Um, well, not, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,
B:	but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.
B:	It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous.
A:	You know, I took advantage of the opportunity when, you know, he came out.
A:	I talked to my kids about it, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's something that I hadn't, hadn't done before.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on, uh, safe sex to abstinence,
A:	or I was glad he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, let's see.
A:	What are some of the other questions.
A:	Uh, you don't, uh,
A:	let's see.
A:	I don't have any friends that have the disease.
A:	I guess you might, might not.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	I do.
B:	My cousin, does, for instance.
A:	Is it pretty nasty?
B:	And, um,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	it is.
B:	He's actually, um,
B:	he had AIDS related complex for a while,
B:	and he is now in full-blown AIDS, really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it sounds awful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's a very nasty thing.
A:	Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly
A:	and,
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,
B:	and the white blood cell count goes down,
B:	which is, that's AIDS Related Complex,
B:	but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS
A:	And,
B:	and in that case, you know, people are prone to getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got before
A:	Oh, really.
B:	and,
B:	yeah,
B:	that sort of thing,
A:	Okay
A:	well,
B:	There we are.
A:	All right. Um, um, well, uh,
A:	tell me about the car that you've got.
B:	Well, I have a Honda, um, hatchback, nineteen eighty-four.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I'll be honest with you.
B:	I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, uh, put together
B:	and it, it does its job.
B:	All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles,
B:	and I, I did have to put two, two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles,
B:	but that car just purrs like the day it was built.
B:	I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town.
B:	It's a five speed straight stick machine.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, I can carry more in that, uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars,
B:	and I have a large, um, Pontiac,
B:	and I have a sixty-nine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old,
B:	but it's in beautiful shape.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other bigger cars.
A:	Well, that's very interesting.
A:	I've had, I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got.
A:	It's a,
A:	and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four
B:	Oh, oh.
A:	and, uh,
B:	L X?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm still here.
A:	Um, I'm sorry what?
B:	It was an L X?
A:	Yes,
A:	it's an L X,
A:	it's not a hatchback,
A:	but it's, um, it's, uh,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yours is a four door.
A:	Four door,
A:	yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and very, very comfortable car.
A:	Big roomy trunk
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, and, uh, and very happy with it,
A:	and I must admit it's, you know,
A:	if, if, if, uh,
A:	my only consideration were, were, you know, buying another car just to tool around town in and make, you know, brief trips and things like that,
A:	I would very, very seriously consider buying one. Uh,
A:	I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars.
B:	Yes,
B:	they are.
A:	Um, my, my real concern with, uh, uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, um, trip down the road about once a month, because I'm divorced
A:	and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina
B:	Um, uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I drive, down Interstate Ninety-five,
A:	and it's just an absolutely wild highway.
B:	Ninety-five is wild in any car.
B:	There's no doubt about that
A:	Yeah
A:	and,
B:	because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to,
B:	I'm retiring the end of this month
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.
A:	And, you, well, you've got it,
A:	and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, that, uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past,
A:	and uh, I've, I've,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service,
A:	but, uh, I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.
A:	Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,
A:	and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, need to be taken care of, and so forth.
A:	And I guess that's one thing that, that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Yes,
B:	it just, just sits there and purrs,
B:	and you, all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.
B:	I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	It's really amazing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	Beautiful, beautiful machine.
A:	Absolutely,
A:	incredible
A:	So, um, yeah,
A:	anyway, I've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,
A:	and I think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about, the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own
B:	Is that right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um,
B:	Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?
A:	Well, certainly some of the top end ones.
A:	You can still get, get, uh, even the, the low end wagons, um, for less than twenty thousand dollars
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we get, you know,
A:	in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here
B:	Um, uh-huh.
A:	so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any week,
A:	and I sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth
A:	and so, um, anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that I've, I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life,
A:	and I've tended to, um, to, uh, buy cars that are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.
A:	This Honda that I have I bought used,
A:	and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.
A:	I've just rolled seventy thousand miles,
A:	and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.
A:	So
B:	Well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where my mother lives, and things like that,
B:	and I drive it,
B:	about the weather
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	very appropriate, I guess.
A:	Uh, you ready for this?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay, John,
A:	just a moment.
A:	Well, guess what,
A:	we get to talk about the weather
B:	The weather is, uh, this time of year has actually been kind of unusual.
B:	I haven't expected it to be colder until, you know
B:	like we've gotten the last couple of days.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I fly for a living,
B:	and I've, uh,
B:	the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been.
A:	Oh, you do
B:	Yeah.
A:	so you, you, you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather.
B:	Well, it was around here last night,
B:	I'll tell you that
A:	Well, actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, uh, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, uh, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirty-two.
B:	No kidding.
A:	So, yeah
B:	Um.
A:	If it keeps on raining like this,
A:	and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night.
B:	Saturday or Sunday they were saying,
B:	yeah.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know the systems have been real strong out.
B:	I went through, uh, Phoenix on, twice on, uh, Wednesday morning
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, approaches to low minimum both, both times
A:	Wow.
B:	and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather
B:	so,
A:	And so are you an airline pilot?
B:	Yes,
B:	I am
A:	Oh, great.
B:	for Southwest,
B:	yeah.
A:	For Southwest,
A:	fantastic.
A:	I have a brother, I have a brother that's a pilot, also, with American.
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Yeah.
A:	So I imagine you, uh, oh, with all this kind of weather it, uh, makes it kind of dangerous for you.
B:	Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.
B:	This is, uh, this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in.
B:	This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime.
A:	Oh, I guess so,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the, the air systems are reasonably calm.
B:	We don't have, uh, the turbulence have a, uh, little bit of chop,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's not like it is in the spring time.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Well, we moved actually down here from another location,
A:	and it's spectacular the, the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain.
B:	Spectacular is the right word for them.
A:	Pardon me?
B:	Spectacular is a good word for them
A:	I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas.
B:	It's amazing.
A:	Lights up the whole sky and even on a, on a,
A:	actually I've, I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky,
A:	it's a cloudless night,
A:	and the rain isn't falling,
A:	but you can see the thunder, and, excuse me, see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth, and what a light show.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	It's, it's fabulous.
B:	cloud to cloud it can be real, really sensational here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	Where are you from originally?
A:	I'm from, uh, northern Utah,
A:	and that's a very arid climate, from, uh, Salt Lake City area
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there's always a lot of snow.
A:	In fact, where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to, uh, twelve different major ski resorts,
A:	and so there was an awful lot of snow,
B:	Oh.
A:	and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and, and sleigh riding and everything else.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, we had a great time.
B:	Were you near, near the Park Cities area.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	in, uh in Snowbird and Solitude and and Brighton and yes, all those areas.
B:	Beautiful area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I imagine, have you skied before?
B:	Well, we've skied,
B:	I have not skied that area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've driven through it several times.
B:	Uh, I skied, we skied California a bunch when we lived out there,
B:	and and, uh, um, and, of course, grew, we grew up in Minnesota,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we do some skiing there lot of cross country skiing there.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	Yeah,
A:	great.
A:	Well, do you think this, the, the weather is typical for this time of the year?
B:	Well, not really,
B:	I, you know,
B:	Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow, um,
B:	the, um, uh,
B:	we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already I think
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today, you know, that moved in last night.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's been, it's been cold.
A:	There was a time, though, in the, uh, middle part of November that got really cool, really, really unseasonably cool
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes,
B:	it did.
A:	and then it warmed right back up,
A:	and I thought, great
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's, that's a fun
A:	yeah,
A:	my wife was just listening here
A:	and she said, yeah,
A:	it froze in fact.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was, it was real cold.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but that was very unseasonable for us down here.
A:	And, uh, but, uh, I've really enjoyed the weather down here, too,
A:	because, uh, two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather,
A:	and it's not as severe, I should say as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that's, that's real true.
B:	Same with us from Minnesota.
B:	It's, it's, uh,
B:	in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, uh, New Year's Day one year.
A:	Down here?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Not in Minnesota
B:	No
B:	no,
B:	no
B:	no.
A:	I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota
A:	and they say, boy, six months out of the year it's bitter cold, and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything.
B:	Oh, it is,
B:	it is.
B:	Well, and they've had, uh, you know,
B:	usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and February,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they're up over sixty-five or
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess tonight's subject is, uh, woodworking.
B:	What  kind of woodworking do you do?
A:	Do you, uh,
A:	Well, kind of, mainly the woodworking I've done lately is, uh, made like, uh, for example a little nativity scene. Uh, not the, uh, the whole figurines and so forth, but mainly the stable, put some shelves in and, and some odd stuff around the house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I, I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking
A:	and I do it out of hobby more than, uh, you know, something I have to do.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Uh, well, I like to think of it as a hobby, but I, I guess also, partly out of necessity. Just repairing things around the house.
B:	Uh, a few years ago, uh, we needed, uh, they needed some book shelves
B:	and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves
B:	and, uh, it actually worked pretty well
B:	and over the years I've, I've refined those plans.
B:	I got myself a router
B:	and I'm, I'm very good at making book shelves.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, it's also a way of relieving stress.
B:	My wife kind of laughs, at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves.
A:	Well, I'll have to come and see them
A:	That sounds like a good idea.
A:	I, you know,
A:	and that's, that is right,
A:	it is out of necessity
A:	because lot of the things that, uh, well, we can't be able to afford,
A:	but also I, I sometimes think that, uh, I enjoy doing that
A:	and I like to get out and, and, uh, to work with my hands
A:	and, uh, sounds like you got some real nice tools, too.
A:	Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools?
B:	Uh, well, yeah,
B:	I mean, little by little, I, I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, gotten a, a good belt sander
B:	and, and, the router, uh, helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The latest project that I've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a, a cabinet to, to put a T V in.
A:	Oh, a entertainment type center?
B:	Right.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it, that's works well because you can design it to, to suit whatever equipment you have
B:	so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the, the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And, uh, that's worked pretty well.
B:	Uh, with, uh, with the router you can make nice, uh,
B:	I guess dado joints is what it's called.
A:	Right,
A:	or yes,
A:	I,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm aware of that.
B:	Uh, And it's, uh,
A:	And also with a router, you can, uh, make ornamental facings, too better than a just straight wood edge. And, Uh, And, uh, casings and so forth that are, that are real nice,
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
B:	So,
A:	so that's, that's good.
A:	That's good.
B:	But what I need next is a good table saw.
A:	Yeah
B:	And I, I debate whether it's better to get a, uh, just a straight table saw or to get one of these, uh, rotary arm saws.
A:	Oh.
B:	Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it seems to me the radial arm saw is, is better,
B:	well, it, it takes up less room.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, you, you set the wood down
B:	and you move the saw.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw.
A:	Well and with a radial arm saw, if you do have a, a big piece of wood that you need to rip, like you say, or cut, you wouldn't be able to do that.
A:	Uh, but, uh, yeah,
A:	a table saw does take a lot of time, excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And,
B:	Uh, that, that's partly my problem now.
B:	I don't have room for this.
B:	I, uh, I,
B:	where, uh, where we lived before up north, uh basements were, were common
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, I used to put all the stuff in my basement,
B:	but not so here in Texas.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No,
A:	they don't have basements.
A:	Well, I'm from up north also
A:	and, and, uh, no
A:	there's no basements down here
A:	and it's kind of, uh, hard to get, uh, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	lot of the equipment, too, that I've, I've used in the past, uh, I you know, I've used in school
A:	and, uh, I would,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I'd, I'd kind of like to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a table saw and some of those things that would make, uh, some pretty nice, uh, pieces of, uh, well, wood, for, for different things for tables, for, for, uh, chairs, for, you know, decks and so forth
A:	so, I don't know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I just enjoy woodworking
A:	and I think the, the main thing is, like you say, it's a, it's a good out.
A:	It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day
A:	and it's a great stress, stress reliever.
B:	Have you ever used a lathe?
A:	Yes,
A:	I have, in school I have
A:	and I've made, uh, uh, different things, uh, uh, tables for chairs
A:	and I've made, uh, bowls,
A:	and, uh, and, uh,
A:	Did you hear our topic?
A:	It's in regards to discussing homes.
B:	Homes,
B:	yes, sir,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	What are, are you settled in a place?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm settled in a place.
A:	I've been in it for twelve years, since nineteen, uh, actually thirteen years, since nineteen seventy-eight
A:	and it's in Richardson, Texas, which is north Texas or north Dallas.
B:	Right
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we've lived in two houses in Richardson.
A:	We moved here in seventy-four and, uh, changed locations in seventy-eight.
B:	Okay.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Well, we, uh, left here in seventy-six.
B:	Uh, we were here for a few years,
B:	then we, uh, have come back just this summer.
B:	Right now we're looking for housing, uh, somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area.
B:	Are you familiar with that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a nice area.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	The kids are in school here in Duncanville.
B:	We're in a temporary place right now
B:	and, uh, so they've enjoyed the school,
B:	so we're kind of trying to stay here
B:	but,
A:	Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want
A:	or,
B:	Well, what, the problem we got is that we've got five children
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	and so, uh, we really want four or five bedroom house
B:	and, uh, you know, everybody says, you know, how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing
A:	right.
B:	so we, uh, we look at the paper,
B:	we look at our, talk to our realtor
B:	and you can cut, you know, the listings, uh, in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms you know, or five.
A:	Sure.
B:	Are you looking
B:	or you settled,
B:	I mean,
A:	No,
A:	we're settled
A:	and, uh we're, uh,
B:	having,
A:	I'm probably older than you,
A:	I'm fifty-two,
A:	but anyway, I, my youngest is getting married this year graduating college,
B:	Oh, great.
A:	so I can board up their rooms, and look forward to retirement maybe.
B:	That empty nest syndrome is going to set in, I guess.
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	so, we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere. Closer, closer to our families.
B:	Great.
B:	Okay.
B:	Okay,
B:	you, are you from Florida originally?
A:	No,
A:	from West Virginia
A:	but everyone's, uh, my wife's parents are from the New York, New Jersey area
B:	Yeah
A:	so, but everyone seems, uh, has seem to relocated down that area.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Seems like a nice place to go
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	We've got five
B:	and the oldest is, uh, ninth grade
B:	and the youngest is second grade
B:	and I think they're going to be, uh, with us forever.
B:	I don't know if that's true,
B:	but it's sure, you know, we're not anywhere near looking to, uh, uh, cut down in size.
B:	We're, we're trying to find,
A:	Oh, I understand.
A:	You need very minimum four and probably five.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	In fact, six would be real good.
A:	Right.
B:	My wife and I can share a bedroom
A:	It's tough to find a five and six room, bedroom house, isn't it?
B:	Either,
B:	Oh, I don't think it's possible unless you, you know, multimillionaire, something like that.
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	Uh,
A:	Seems like you get in that category, you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever
A:	and it's that's an awful lot, you know
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, we're having,
B:	actually, if we find something for, uh, I'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand, we'll be doing all right, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	That's, uh,
B:	but I think the thing's out there,
B:	it's just a matter of, uh you know, looking you know finding the right place, uh,
A:	Just, Matter of looking,
A:	right.
A:	Lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something.
A:	I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school
A:	and she had, uh, there were seven kids in her family.
B:	Wow.
A:	And they converted the dining room and, did this and that,
A:	but they always seemed to get along fine, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I think once we get into a place, it will be just fine,
B:	but you know, it's until then, it's, uh, oh, a little stressful, you know, just looking all the time and that sort of thing.
A:	Oh, sure.
A:	Oh, I know
A:	and it's, there's nothing harder than that.
A:	I always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore,
A:	then I would let her narrow it down to three or four,
A:	then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Maybe that's the case.
B:	At least she's got more opinions, you know,
B:	there's, uh, seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about. You know, openness, uh, the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and, maybe even ignore, you know.
A:	Yes.
A:	Why, certainly.
A:	I  understand that.
B:	So.  What kind of business are you in?
A:	I'm in the, uh, sporting goods business.
A:	I'm a manufacturer's rep.
A:	I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	great.
A:	What, who are you with?
B:	Uh, we're with an organization called, uh, Wycliff Bible Translators.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a, a missions organization and, uh, doing, uh, translation, linguistics, that sort of thing.
A:	Well, great.
B:	Uh, it's got an office down here in, uh, in, near Duncanville
B:	and we just moved down to be on staff down here
B:	so.
A:	How, how was the, uh,
A:	you say you lived in the Denver area before?
B:	Right.
A:	How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices?
B:	Uh, we were, uh, really surprised to find that they're higher here. Uh,
A:	No kidding.
B:	When we moved from Louisiana to Denver, it was astounding, you know, to find that prices were, oh, I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected.
B:	And then, uh, to come down here, we thought things would be lower,
B:	and they're not.
B:	I guess, uh, really, prices for housing are just,
A:	Okay,
A:	should begin. *listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"
B:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	Uh, I can begin this, um,
A:	basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the, the benefit program we have here is really quite good.
A:	I'm, I'm pretty pleased with it.
A:	They cover, uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, you name it,
A:	and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much,
A:	so I'm pretty satisfied myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, what's your situation?
B:	I work for the University of New Hampshire,
B:	and uh, our benefits package isn't, uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. Uh, you know,
A:	Oh.
B:	overall I'm satisfied with it.
B:	We don't have the vision care,
B:	we do have the health care and the, uh, and the or the dental.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh.
A:	Are you a professor there?
B:	No,
B:	I work in, I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,
B:	and I, effectively I run the telephone switch at, uh, at the University of New Hampshire.
A:	Oh, I see,
A:	okay.
B:	Uh, so the, uh, the benefits,
B:	uh, probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.
A:	Oh, no doubt
B:	We get fifteen days a year sick time,
B:	and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is, uh,
A:	I used to work with the Army Research Institute,
A:	and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.
B:	Right.
A:	But here you don't get that.
A:	You maybe get two or three a year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it's really,
A:	unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that's, that's kind of a drawback I think.
A:	But, uh. I don't know.
A:	What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of, of the different benefits?
B:	Well, I think, uh, the, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, uh you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm, I'm a little disturbed about that,
B:	but I think that's a national trend,
B:	and I don't know that, uh, I don't know what the solution is to it.
B:	It's bigger than just the benefits part.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night,
A:	they, uh, they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward, uh, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	It's kind of an interesting plan.
A:	It's kind of cold though.
A:	They've essentially made up a list of, uh, oh, all the different, uh, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by, by, uh, subsidized health care,
A:	and the ones above would.
B:	Um.
A:	So it's kind of like drawing this line
A:	and, and if you have it great,
A:	if you don't, you're kind of out of luck
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, it was kind of an interesting show.
B:	Um.
A:	I think you're right,
A:	I think health care is probably the, the most pressing uh, the pressing one,
B:	Right.
A:	but I'll tell you, I, I don't mind having dental, you know,
A:	sometimes dental costs can be, um, just about as expensive, if not more,
A:	and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I'm not sure that's, that's widely followed any more.
A:	I'm not sure,
A:	how, how does, uh, University of New Hampshire handle it?
B:	Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, uh, depending,
B:	and, and the cost between them is very, is very little.
B:	I think it costs me something like five dollars a, a month for the dental plan.
A:	Um.
B:	But it pays, uh, a substantial amount.
B:	I mean, the examinations and, and, uh, checkups every year, or every six months are free
A:	Great.
B:	and, uh, it, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.
A:	Is that, uh, let me interrupt, is that the same for both, uh, professors and, and also staff and administration,
A:	is that generally across the board, do you think
A:	or,
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	it is.
B:	The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff, which I belong to
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the main,
B:	I think the, the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.
B:	But the main difference is in the, uh, the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh, for the operating staff it's on a seniority, it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.
A:	Right.
B:	That determines how much, uh, vacation time they get.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm kind of interested because I'm actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to, uh, is to teach in a university.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
B:	Oh.
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's interesting.
A:	That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would, uh, they would cover and things like that.
B:	College programs belong to this T I A A, uh, C R E F retirement fund.
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Right,
B:	and in the case of the University of New Hampshire, uh,
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	What's your view.
B:	Huh?
A:	What's your view?
B:	Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	I mean,
A:	You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, you know,
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	I don't know.
A:	Coming from Texas you're probably,
A:	I don't know
A:	I shouldn't make stereo types,
A:	but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It is,
B:	but I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas,
B:	I just live down here now.
B:	I've  I've lived down here a couple years.
A:	Oh, you're just live down there?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm originally from Colorado,
B:	but yeah
A:	Oh well.
B:	there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I know how you feel.
A:	I'm, uh, I grew up in Nebraska
A:	and, and we always use to go out and hunt all the time, you know
A:	and man, there's no way. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's just,
A:	I don't know.
B:	I just think, I think it's ridiculous.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean,
A:	It doesn't sit with me very well.
A:	I don't know, I, anymore
A:	I keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I just about all,
A:	well I live in Minneapolis
A:	and I,
A:	well actually I live in Florida,
A:	but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year
A:	and you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and it's just, you never know who is out there.
B:	Right.
A:	You know it's just for self protection purposes
A:	and then of course there's the hunting issue,
A:	so
B:	Sure.
A:	yeah
A:	that's good.
A:	What do you do, Jeff?
B:	Uh, I, I'm in, uh, program control for a company up here.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	All right.
B:	We do schedules, for programs, schedule programs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	What do you do?
A:	I'm, uh, researcher of Honeywell up here.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, uh,
A:	yeah.
A:	You guys uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
A:	or,
B:	Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.
B:	I don't own a shotgun,
B:	but I'd like to go bird hunting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know  that's something I miss quite a bit.
B:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you, you know, quite a bit
A:	Yeah.
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	All right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit,
A:	but I don't know.
A:	I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, uh, for a complete,
B:	One for a total ban and, uh,
A:	That's right.
A:	I guess I am about eight or nine
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree with you there
A:	Yeah,
A:	no doubt about it
A:	but, uh,
B:	I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, you know, I'm not  for it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if there's  if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know that
A:	they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they actually, uh,
A:	I know it's this way in Florida.
A:	They have a waiting period where you buy one
A:	and that's a week
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.
A:	I think that's a pretty good idea.
A:	Uh, and that's,
A:	I don't know,
A:	that's not a bad idea,
A:	but then again you can always get around that.
A:	You could go through the black market like you say.
A:	You know, you always be able to get around
A:	but, uh,
B:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's one of things
A:	but, uh, I don't know.
A:	I guess, I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't either
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm just not,
A:	I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned altogether anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I
A:	There,
B:	fully auto,
B:	but, even well, I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's,
A:	It kind of takes the sport out of hunting
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.
B:	Sure.
A:	You know, you might do the same thing.
B:	Right.
A:	And so it's like, I don't know. It does.
A:	It takes the sport out of it.
A:	For me I would much rather have a bow anytime
B:	Oh, really.
A:	I, I like bows.
A:	You know, I have done some bow hunting
A:	and I, uh, I get into it
A:	and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I don't know.
A:	I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.
B:	Sure.
A:	But, uh, I don't know.
A:	Anyway, that's about where I stand
B:	Me too.
A:	You, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am about the same way.
A:	And you, uh, have you eaten yet or whatever.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is it seven o'clock there?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	it's about seven fifteen.
A:	You guys central?
B:	How is the weather up there?
A:	Oh, it's not too good.
A:	It's kind of rainy actually.
B:	Is it?
A:	Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees
B:	Right.
A:	and it's been up around forty.
A:	So people are, people are whining about the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature.
A:	Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I am just up here for the year
A:	and it's kind of shocking.
A:	Wendy, I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if, uh, if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	let me ask you the question,
A:	do you have a, uh, budget, or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to?
B:	Right now I'm in college
B:	and I'm on work study
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so my budget comes from my dad's help.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He helps me out a lot
B:	and I get paid monthly,
B:	so that's kind of hard to have a budget.
B:	My mother, uh, doesn't get paid much money,
B:	so her budget is, uh, just, uh, planning for I R A's.
A:	I see,
A:	I see.
A:	Well, good,
A:	I'm kind of in a different situation,
A:	but I, I, I went through that, too, when I was in school,
A:	but, uh, I was, I was working to get through college and, and, uh, trying to make it through that,
A:	but, uh, I'm married and have, uh, a, a couple of children
A:	and we have to, uh, pretty much stick to a budget.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm on a salary
A:	so I don't get any overtime or anything like that
A:	but, We have a fixed income
B:	Oh.
A:	and we have to make sure that, uh, every dollar we have will, is spent accordingly
A:	and, uh, what we try and do to, to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we have the insurance premiums, uh, utilities and so forth
A:	and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside,
A:	and we also try and set aside money for savings, set aside money for the the kids' education college education, the future and, uh, set aside money for bonds
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and we also set aside an emergency fund
A:	because we've, uh, we've been married for about ten years
B:	That sounds good.
A:	and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on, there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house, that you have to have money for and, uh, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, uh, you have to have money for.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, then we have, you know,
A:	whatever's left over is disposable disposable, yeah, discretionary income, that we use for the rest of the month,
A:	so, and it's worked out very well.
A:	It's, uh, it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too long on the month and too short on the money and uh, try and stick with that
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	and, nice thing about it, I, my wife is, is excellent in that we both work together,
A:	we both have a budget,
A:	and we stick to it
B:	Well, good.
A:	and there's no surprises in that
B:	With two kids, that could be hard.
A:	Well, actually I have four kids.
B:	Four!
A:	So,
A:	yeah,
A:	I said a couple of kids,
A:	I, I guess I should have specified,
A:	I have four four little boys,
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	yeah.
B:	Four boys.
A:	You bet.
B:	Oh, my
A:	You bet.
B:	It's just me and my sister.
A:	All right
B:	And my parents divorced three years ago
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my sister had gotten through college,
B:	but I was still in high school,
B:	and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together
A:	Yes.
B:	and then, uh, before the divorce she had saved for my college.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, when we had the divorce, she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house.
A:	Oh.
B:	So now my dad's paying for all of my college of
A:	Well, good,
A:	good.
B:	And financial aid and scholarships.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm a music major,
B:	so I have auditions coming up.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, what year are you in in college?
B:	I'm a sophomore.
A:	You're a sophomore,
A:	so you have a few more years.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	I'll, I'll probably have about, two, two and a half years left.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, good for you.
A:	Good for you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I imagine it, uh, is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that, during school and so it forth.
B:	Oh, it sure is.
B:	I, I know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks
A:	Yes
B:	and I, and I don't spend over that
A:	Well, great,
A:	great.
A:	And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and, and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on, too.
B:	Oh, sure,
B:	there's, there's always music  books to buy.
A:	Lab fees and all,
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	oh, yes.
A:	Well, you're not a starving artist, yet, are you?
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no,
B:	no.
A:	Good.
B:	I don't plan on being a starving artist
A:	Well, good.
B:	That's why I'm in college
A:	there's enough of those in the world, huh?
B:	Right
A:	Good,
A:	good,
A:	I'm glad to hear that, Wendy.
B:	That's usually because they're not real educated.
B:	They can't afford to have a really good job.
A:	Who's, who's not very well educated?
B:	The starving ones.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	yes.
B:	There's enough out there that if you have, if you're educated enough, then you can make money.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true.
A:	I found that out.
A:	So that's why I'm planning and, and preparing for the, uh, education of my children, also try and set that money aside.
B:	Right.
B:	What did you major in?
A:	I majored in business administration.
B:	Well, good,
B:	you know plenty about planning a a budget.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh, once again,
B:	Not very good
B:	it's not been a good day
A:	I went, I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn
B:	so I hope she's turned it in.
A:	Are you eating?
B:	Uh, I
B:	go ahead,
B:	I'll stop eating.
B:	I just barely got  home from the university.
A:	No it's,
A:	Say what?
B:	I just barely got home from the university.
A:	Tell you what we can do is, uh, I can punch the, uh, one,
A:	and then after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want
B:	Okay,
B:	go ahead,
B:	fire away.
A:	Uh, I love the irony of, uh, talking about this subject on April the, fifteenth
A:	But, uh, I'm afraid I'm, I'm probably in the minority.
A:	I, I actually don't think that we, uh, pay too much in this country. Uh uh, particularly, uh, in this part of the country
B:	I agree with you
A:	uh, I guess I do have a, a bone to pick with, uh, uh, the way taxes are distributed
A:	Uh, I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
B:	Huh.
A:	and the sales tax can't.
A:	I think that's regressive
A:	and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb.
B:	I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax.
B:	But, on the other hand, I don't mind that it's only on, you know, things that aren't like groceries and that,
B:	it's not on that.
A:	Well, I mean, nobody taxes groceries.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	they do.
A:	Where?
B:	In Arizona.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we have a pretty low income I mean pretty low tax rate here.
B:	Oh, I think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it.
A:	Right.
B:	But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes.
A:	Right
A:	But I guess when I hear, when I see the comparison between the United States and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,
A:	if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.
A:	there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are.
B:	Well and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay for it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
B:	Well, I mean, I think,
B:	I was in Germany, you know, for several years
A:	Right.
B:	and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.
A:	Oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Higher taxes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I suppose that's true,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh, probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever
A:	but,
B:	Still's that way to some extent.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.
A:	Right.
B:	But I look, for example,
B:	and you're not quite in the same situation
B:	but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world.
A:	Right.
B:	I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	since, uh, I send my kids to parochial school, that .
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that's probably a little tougher on you
A:	It's not, it's not quite the bargain that .
A:	But, I mean, I pay them gladly.
A:	That's a decision,
A:	I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money.
A:	But, uh, I mean, that's, that's the way Americans want to interpret it,
A:	I guess that's all right
A:	But,
A:	yeah.
A:	I,
A:	and if I were, uh,
A:	when I was single and again when I'm retired, I will not mind paying, uh, what it takes to keep the schools good.
A:	That's always been a high priority
B:	No,
B:	I think that's just you though.
A:	I do,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	I think in places,  I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, uh, uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, uh, just looking for fun, people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,  there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done.
A:	That seems a, a, like a cultural lapse.
A:	I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.
A:	They,
B:	Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	People would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them.
A:	But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted.
B:	Or build roads.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well,
A:	Okay.
B:	Wonderful touch tone telephone there.
A:	Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?
B:	Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies,
B:	therefore, my, my reading pleasures are quite wide.
B:	Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS HIGHWAY, which is, uh, very colorful, and, uh, not being a native of Texas, but being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the different areas of the of the, of the state by reading it.
A:	Oh.
A:	Right,
A:	I've read that one too.
A:	I only had a subscription once,
A:	but my mother always gave me hers
A:	and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.
B:	It's pretty, pretty neat.
B:	Um, oh, I like photography, um, magazines.
B:	I don't take a subscription or anything like that.
B:	Um, things, oh,
B:	being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
B:	and, and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it,
B:	but, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Well, um, I have an interest in art,
A:	so I, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.
A:	Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's fairly interesting.
B:	I bet that would be, rather interesting.
B:	Uh, that's, uh, self improvement,
B:	that's, that's well, that's kind of a hobby
B:	but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
A:	How about you?
B:	Um, well I hate to,
B:	yes,
B:	I do
B:	We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes
B:	and, and they give you books
B:	and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht .
B:	It talks about, uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
B:	and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.
B:	You're my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all, you know, betters yourself.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean they are
A:	but I don't label it as such.
B:	Like what for example.
A:	Well, I don't know, um,
A:	I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,
A:	but, uh, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know getting your, yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big,
B:	okay.
A:	Yes.
B:	So those are self improvements.
A:	Sure.
B:	Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L it
A:	Um.
B:	and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.
B:	And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers
B:	So it's, it's it's interesting,
B:	here again it's, it's casual reading
B:	and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff
B:	and it's really excellent fast reading
B:	and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, you know,
B:	I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King.
A:	That's a little, little heavy for me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting
B:	and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,
B:	but, uh, it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I have a hard time finishing books.
A:	Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways .
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
A:	but, uh, I think sometimes the word is a little over used
B:	Exactly, exactly right.
A:	but,
B:	Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.
B:	I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
B:	and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, any other comments.
B:	Uh, not that I can think of.
B:	Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit.
B:	I need to probably make a phone call or two
A:	Well we just started,
A:	right.
B:	Uh, this is true.
B:	I've enjoyed it.
A:	Well you too,
A:	and uh, good-bye.
B:	Have a good day.
A:	Good-bye.
B:	Bye-bye
A:	Okay, um,
A:	I don't know about you
A:	but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work
A:	and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next
A:	It's pretty bad,
A:	but it's true, you know, in
A:	they tend to try to be, you know, real lax
A:	and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people
A:	and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know.
A:	We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want.
A:	And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.
B:	Well, I'm kind of that way too.
B:	I work in the legal department
B:	and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,
B:	it always seems like I'm doing that
B:	and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around,
B:	so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down.
B:	But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, we're kind of that way too.
A:	I try to,
A:	I'm the same way you are,
A:	I kind of try to judge from day to day.
A:	I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers
A:	and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
A:	and, and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if I know they're not, you know,
A:	I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	It is
A:	and so,
B:	As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story
B:	when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes.
B:	We had them in the warehouse,
A:	Uh.
B:	and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road
B:	and it wasn't air conditioned,
B:	and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer,
B:	it's unair-conditioned,
B:	it was dusty and dirty, uh,
B:	there was like a fan at the very end of the row
B:	and that was it.
B:	And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to,
B:	we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we wore shorts.
B:	We didn't know that was a big no, no.
A:	Oh no.
B:	And the supervisor from another area came up to us
B:	and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there,
B:	and he, he knew who worked there,
B:	he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there.
B:	And he came up to us
B:	and he just said, who's your supervisor.
B:	Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor,
B:	and it went up all the way to the head of facilities, complaining that we were wearing shorts.
A:	Oh no in
B:	He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.
B:	That could have alleviated a big problem.
B:	We ended up getting called out on it.
A:	Oh, how awful.
A:	It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I don't care,
A:	you can call them split skirts
A:	and you can call them culottes all you want
A:	but these were shorts.
A:	That's all they were.
A:	I don't care what else you call them, you know,
A:	if they're below the knee, okay,
A:	maybe you can call them split skirts.
A:	If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know.
A:	And these weren't even really full ones.
A:	I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know,
A:	and these weren't even those.
A:	These were like pretty short, black,
A:	and they were very dressy,
A:	the were black velvet shorts
A:	and she had on black hose and black heels
A:	and she looked very, very nice.
B:	Um.
A:	But, you don't wear shorts to work.
A:	You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation
A:	and nobody says anything to them.
A:	It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.
B:	Um.
A:	You know, if they just, you know,
A:	the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no,
A:	this is wear we're going to draw the line.
A:	This is shorts, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,
B:	Um.
A:	so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too.
A:	It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,
A:	but.
B:	Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they have said no
A:	Yeah
A:	and then during the week you see these women, in the you know,
A:	just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,
A:	I mean they always have hose on,
A:	but still, it's, they're shorts,
A:	I don't care what you say,
A:	they're shorts.
A:	Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.
B:	I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,
B:	I had a friend,
A:	Oh do they really?
B:	Oh definitely.
B:	I had a friend who worked there for a year or so
B:	and they spell it out.
B:	For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes.
A:	Oh, my God.
B:	Oh, it is definitely lined out.
B:	Women are not allowed to wear slacks,
B:	you wear coordinated suits.
A:	I I couldn't afford to work there.
B:	And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,
B:	oh it is spelled out.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it told about the dress code
B:	and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.
A:	T I says no shorts and no halters
A:	I know, that's it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,
A:	Wow.
B:	I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.
A:	I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.
A:	I mean, I see,
A:	I, I am more,
A:	I don't know about anybody else,
A:	and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,
A:	but I am more productive when I'm in pants.
A:	I, I am.
A:	I work faster,
A:	I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know,
A:	I,
A:	and it's weird
A:	but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.
B:	Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.
B:	And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
B:	but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.
A:	Right.
B:	And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.
B:	We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know,
B:	you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.
B:	And she And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.
A:	You can't do that in a skirt poor soul.
A:	Oh yuck.
B:	She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants
B:	but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's terrible,
A:	that's terrible
A:	gosh.
A:	Well I don't know,
A:	I just figure, you know, yeah,
A:	sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants,
A:	and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know.
A:	But I'll go in in pants.
A:	I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.
A:	And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on,
A:	but, you know, I don't know if they do or not.
A:	You know, I see a lot of the managers
A:	and they're in jeans,
A:	so, you know.
B:	Some of our people in the legal department,
B:	we have, um, assistants to the general counsel
B:	and it's funny
B:	because, there's one that always wears a suit.
B:	A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.
A:	Really, wow.
B:	And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish
B:	and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
B:	and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.
B:	So that's just,
A:	Isn't that funny.
B:	With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on
B:	so. We've, we've kind of had a variety there
A:	That's great.
B:	but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with,
B:	or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If they're just going to be meeting with T I like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
B:	and they're usually casual.
A:	That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It really is, because your making, you know,
A:	if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know,
A:	or it would me, you know.
B:	It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	look at this slick guy,
A:	I wonder what kind of money does he make,
A:	uh-huh
A:	I can see it now.
A:	Well it was good to talk to you.
A:	It was really enjoyable.
B:	Yeah,
B:	this is, this is kind of a fun project.
A:	It really is.
B:	I've done some of the other speech programs,
B:	but we've never got to talk to another person,
B:	it was always just talking to the computer.
A:	Oh, yuck,
A:	yeah.
B:	So this is a little different.
A:	Well it's kind of enjoyable,
A:	I'm really looking forward to it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well thanks a lot.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	The question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service.
B:	I think it would be a great idea.
B:	I'm not sure about requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.
B:	I don't know,
B:	but I think it would be a great idea.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of, you know, what they want to be or do
B:	or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time
B:	and we, sure, our country, all countries sure need help
B:	so,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a local, uh,
A:	my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while, and, uh, in San Salvador, in El Salvador,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	For instance, everybody had what they called there social year, that they had to put in
B:	Oh, really.
A:	and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and most of them joined the Red Cross
A:	and it was done internally.
A:	I just,
A:	there was very little external.
A:	I think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps, Type things where we're sending people off shore.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think that would be real interesting for people to do,
B:	but, I guess, my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and, but, I don't know.
B:	If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really, you know, send children to do that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I didn't know.
A:	I don't, I don't know how the Peace Corps works,
A:	I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in, and all that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was too.
B:	I thought seriously about joining at that time,
B:	I thought it was a fantastic idea.
A:	Did you ever get any information on it like,
B:	I sent off for stuff on it,
B:	but I don't remember that much. about it.
B:	I know that they trained you in the language
B:	and, um,
A:	That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually,
B:	You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps,
B:	it wasn't much,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I guess, they, you could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and,
A:	Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think so,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink
A:	Where they couldn't do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you might end up with a revolution.
A:	I don't know which end though.
B:	Really
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way to do it,
A:	because from what I understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,
B:	Public hanging.
A:	yeah.
A:	Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know,
A:	so you don't have just a whole lot of, what we consider street crimes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I've heard that like in China and stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered, you know, on the, you know, street
B:	so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, I guess, is a little, anyway,
A:	the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again
A:	I, I, I guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought, you know, Um, I, I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,
A:	but when you do that then it becomes almost, uh, a ,
A:	or it can be,
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, there have,
A:	people will kind of set up their own little club,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	And, uh, but if, you know,
B:	People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Might not go if it was voluntary,
B:	but I don't know how they'd enforce it,
B:	if it was,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Shoot them.
A:	Put them in jail
B:	I don't know.
B:	Send them over to Iraq
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	Have a vacation in Iraq for a year
A:	I know my dad always talked about, uh,
A:	he was in C C C during, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And he was, uh, a rock rib Iowa type republican
A:	and the only good thing he could ever say about, uh, the whole Roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	because he was in it.
A:	He thought that was great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The rest of it was all hog wash,
A:	but that was great.
B:	Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.
B:	It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled that way.
B:	I, I,
B:	it would take quite a few people.
B:	I think it might build jobs for people, you know, that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,
B:	so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah
A:	the only,
B:	Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
A:	Well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,
A:	what would you have, who, who, who would determine what these people do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know, if, uh, you know, if it's run by the individual state.
A:	You know like C C C was run by the army
A:	and in effect,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And, uh, when the politics get real confusing,
B:	Yeah,
B:	really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that were really fair and you know, in a legal way or something,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they could send all the people over to, uh, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported,
B:	or,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well,
A:	We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, if, well, if the racial make up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know, That kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That could be a complicated too, couldn't it.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction oriented
A:	and they went and they, they built, uh, can't think of a good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know,
A:	and one, you can, you can only build it in one place, you know,
A:	and know matter where you build it, somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	Unfair or something,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think, uh,
A:	oh, boy
A:	It's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great idea.
A:	It's like a joke I heard once about, uh, elephant foot soup, you know,
A:	it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.
A:	It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, gets you going.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Really.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it seems like there's, there's a lot,
B:	you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting to do anything good or anything like that,
B:	but you know, I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing.
B:	I just, I saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting a,
B:	I guess now she's practically a teenager,
A:	Yeah.
B:	She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,
B:	and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas,
B:	there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a, um, minority, you know,
B:	I think it was in a Hispanic area,
B:	they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers, instead of, they said, all these gangs kids could join to belong.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so they were trying to start that out,
B:	so if there's people out there that are willing to, you know, kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy. Gosh, we ought to use them. You know. If their willing to do it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's , it's just the, you know,
A:	here you are to the logistics of the thing again, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Who's going to run it, you know,
A:	what,
A:	how,
A:	oh, it's just so many
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like, like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America.
A:	My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and they have situations like, like that down there. Where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	if you want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go to school in Cornell, Iowa, of all places,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and when they came back, they'd have to serve this, this year,
A:	and it turned out to be kind of a joke,
A:	the ones I knew, you know, always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural, and you know, Really good stuff,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very slim.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so,
B:	Well, we, um, belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is like the Mormon church.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And, um, there, there is men and also women,
B:	women aren't nearly as frequent,
B:	and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left, that can volunteer to go on a mission
B:	and, um, they're all over the world.
B:	And, its incredible logistics,
B:	I mean, they have a training center where they teach them,
B:	it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah,
B:	and they have, to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then they, um, you know, go and actually live in that country for the, the, uh,
B:	young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months.
A:	Okay.
A:	Then that's, uh, kind of a private organization,
B:	Right.
A:	you know, I'm, I'm familiar with,
A:	my instructor pilot was a Mormon,
A:	he was, he was a good construction, uh, you know, instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible,
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	He had a direct connection somewhere, uh
A:	Yeah,
A:	right
A:	He felt that he really had an in
A:	so, You know, things he would do with an airplane,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but any rate that's off the subject,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I,
B:	They, they don't get paid for it,
B:	and, um, but there is funding that comes,
B:	they're supposedly saving up on their own
B:	and the church helps them out some,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.
A:	I see how they were organized in, Central and South America
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, it's, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
A:	I'll let you start first, okay?
B:	Okay.
B:	We, um, I'm presently living in a house, uh,
B:	first time, uh,
B:	we had the house built
B:	and so this is our, our fifth year in it I guess,
B:	and, uh, um, it was a real excitement to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one made and built
B:	and like you wanted it, we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses.
B:	And, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home,
B:	and they're good for about five years or four years
B:	and after that they start falling apart.
B:	So, I would, uh, not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in, uh, because they're overpriced, uh,
B:	but they're a cheap house.
B:	If you can't afford something good, you know,
B:	they're good for that,
B:	and, um, you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head,
B:	but as far as the costs for what your getting, uh, the longevity of the house is not, uh, is not worth it.
B:	How about in your case?
A:	Well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter,
A:	but, in fact, he's in electronics,
A:	but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it.
A:	So it took him about two and a half years,
A:	but, uh, he built us a house,
A:	it's, uh,
A:	we have thirty-two hundred square feet,
A:	and it's a brick house,
A:	and price-wise, it was great because he did it all himself, you know,
A:	so that way he could, we could kind of control, in, control it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, we live in kind of a small town,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I mean it's nothing fancy, you know,
A:	it's, it's a house,
A:	it's nice,
A:	and it's real pretty
A:	and we're all comfortable in it.
B:	Well, that's great,
B:	that's great,
B:	that's, uh,
B:	I've heard,
B:	I have another gentleman, friend of mine, who, uh, who had a house built
B:	as a matter of fact another guy is building one now,
B:	he's been doing it for three years
B:	and the city's a little upset with him,
B:	but I understand you save a lot of money off, uh, by doing that,
B:	and, uh,
A:	Oh, you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else.
B:	Nothing wrong with that,
A:	You know.
B:	uh, I'll vouch for that.
B:	Um,
A:	But, uh, of course, my husband did everything except
A:	my brother's a trim carpenter,
A:	and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us,
A:	and that helped.
B:	That was a big savings.
A:	And, uh,
A:	yes,
A:	and, uh, we had to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else, nothing, you know,
B:	Well, that's great.
B:	uh, have you been in it long?
B:	Oh, really,
B:	well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?
A:	no,
A:	we're,
A:	well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now,
A:	and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,
A:	but he will not build a second one himself. Because he says age-wise he'll never be able to handle that again
B:	I see,
B:	well,
B:	First one is always a bear.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	We're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us
B:	and that can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any you know,
B:	so that's kind of, we just got with him and told him what all we wanted,
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
B:	and he's certified, and registered
B:	so at least we know we're, it's not going to fall in or something if it's built.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh.
B:	But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right,
B:	you can actually go out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things
B:	and, and that's kind of the plan I have
B:	so, I'm, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	everyone I talk to, uh, I file in my little book and do other things with it .
B:	That's great,
B:	that's great.
A:	But, uh, like I said otherwise, you know, the expense,
A:	but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.
B:	Sure,
B:	I can imagine.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that,
A:	but, you know, it's ours.
B:	If your happy with it, that's all that counts.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
B:	That's all,
B:	you only have to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.
A:	apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high
B:	Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell, I guess.
A:	Isn't it?
A:	It really is
A:	because I, I'm always shocked at about, you know, what they have it appraised at,
A:	I think, oh my goodness.
B:	Well that's great.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I guess that about does it.
A:	Okay,
A:	and it was nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking with you, too.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States.
B:	Okay.
A:	How do you feel about that.
B:	I don't really,
B:	I more,
B:	I don't know about the government as much as, uh,
B:	the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all
B:	and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.
B:	I'm, I'm worried about them.
B:	They're in a very, uh, tumultuous state right now with the kinds of, uh, adaptations that they're attempting to go through, uh.
A:	I'm concerned about them not as a military threat, but as a burden.
A:	They're very large
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they can become very quickly a large financial burden, as, as one more stepchild we have to carry around.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's, that's a real important aspect
B:	and that, uh, as the, the the most, the
B:	let's see, the more that we do, that we do or that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming, uh, you know, a reality.
B:	I know that, uh, this last winter was very hard on, uh, several areas in the, in the, the Ukraine, particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia, uh,
B:	the people there have money,
B:	that's not their problem,
B:	but there's no food for them to buy,
B:	and its,
B:	you can't eat money.
A:	And they have, a, a problem, their, their whole attitude, uh,
A:	I, I'm not sure which crop it was,
A:	but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that. Make the government do that, that's not my job.
B:	Right,
B:	they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now,
B:	and, uh, they've been, they've been under, under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms
B:	but they don't know how to act yet.
B:	They don't understand that to make that work,
B:	they've got to take some responsibility for themselves.
B:	It's not just the government's responsibility anymore.
B:	You can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well.
A:	Absolutely,
A:	and, and I think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back.
A:	People only go forward
A:	and I think that that is giving them,
A:	I'm expecting a call
A:	and unfortunately, I think it's come through.
A:	I've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Okay.
A:	Thank you,
A:	bye,
B:	All right,
B:	bye-bye.
B:	Real problem the last few days, one of their, uh, young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season,
B:	it was a catcher.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they really don't have an excess of catchers
B:	and it's really kind of, kind of late to, you know, to start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They're not the highest paying ball team around.
A:	Oh no,
A:	no,
A:	they're not, are they.
B:	But I, you know, I would, I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you.
A:	Oh, goodness,
A:	I would too,
A:	even the bench warmer, I would.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
B:	I really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years.
B:	I used to go, take my son, you know,
B:	when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'll have to admit I kind, I kind of went more to see, to see the other team a lot of times than I did the, did the Rangers,
A:	Uh, yeah.
B:	But, I think they're doing better.
A:	Well, I do to, uh,
A:	I have boys, you know, like eight and eleven
A:	and we go quite often, to watch the Rangers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can imagine.
B:	I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh yes,
A:	we're heavy into that too.
B:	I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.
A:	Oh, I do too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I think, uh, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, you know,
A:	yes.
B:	Oh of course,
B:	of course.
B:	As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning,
B:	he just pitched his first, uh, exhibition game a day or so ago,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he pitched five, uh, yeah, five full innings.
B:	That was almost unheard of for a pitcher to, you know, to start out that strong.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	no big deal, you know,
B:	it's just part of a day's work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know it,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	He's something else,
B:	he really is.
A:	He really is an, you know,
A:	as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.
B:	They could do very well,
B:	they sure could.
A:	They because
A:	I don't know
A:	but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	I really do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they've got, uh, I guess all,
B:	well all their players are signed now.
B:	Some of them are not too happy about it
B:	but there, there's no hold outs.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	at least, that should help,
B:	So that should help.
A:	it sure should.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it should, uh-huh.
A:	But in a way, I really do,
A:	and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	sure.
A:	Like Oakland A's and the Giants
A:	I really do.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	Cincinnati.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there sure are.
A:	I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	that's right.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I've never seen the Astros play.
A:	Oh you haven't?
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Oh, I have a few times.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, they're a good ball team.
B:	That's right.
A:	They really are.
B:	They sure are.
B:	Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between the Rangers and the Astros.
A:	Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it though
B:	Boy,
B:	I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.
A:	Wouldn't it.
B:	It sure would.
A:	Oh my goodness,
A:	we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.
B:	That's right,
B:	wouldn't that be something.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It sure would.
A:	That's something you dream about.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	But there are a lot of Ranger fans around.
A:	Oh, there sure is
A:	and, uh, that, I mean they really are.
A:	Uh, now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him
A:	but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and, be on top.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	boy,
B:	he's a bull, isn't he?
A:	Isn't he though,
B:	He really is gosh.
A:	he sure is.
A:	He either hits home run or strike out.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's right.
A:	There is not ever a in between for him.
B:	That's right,
B:	it's kind of like Babe Ruth.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though.
B:	Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year
B:	and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again.
A:	To sign him again,
A:	yeah.
A:	Huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, you know, may or may not happen.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh you never know.
B:	That's right,
B:	it's a long way away.
A:	That's sure
A:	if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right,
B:	unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	no, like that Joe Hosago you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	I mean, oh.
B:	Is there going to be a ticket increase this year, price, do you know.
A:	I hadn't heard.
B:	I haven't either,
A:	I, I really haven't, uh,
B:	The, uh, those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	But I didn't know,
B:	I, I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers,
B:	or I don't remember it if I have.
A:	Well I hadn't either,
B:	Yeah.
A:	We hadn't, you know,
A:	like I said, we,
A:	I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess it's too early.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because we usually get one.
A:	We usually order our tickets way in advance.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it's a good idea,
B:	yeah.
A:	We, we try to go so often.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah
B:	if you have young, young children, you know, they, they get a kick out of it.
A:	Oh, they do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Well you too Lori
A:	And, we'll hopefully we'll get to talk again.
B:	Right,
B:	you take care.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	okay.
B:	What, what is,
B:	do you have a favorite recipe?
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe,
A:	well, it says, why would you, what you would have for a dinner party.
A:	Um, this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin.
B:	Oh.
A:	Okay,
A:	maybe, maybe we're all set.
A:	Okay,
A:	we'll talk for five minutes,
A:	they interrupt at the end.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	it says what you would have for a dinner party,
A:	I just happen to plan one out for Saturday
A:	I'll tell you, what I'm going to have. Um, if I can find it.
B:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well, I have this new fondue pot
A:	and I was going to do basic cheese fondue,
A:	and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham
A:	and I was going to try something weird which, you know,
A:	when you have fish au gratin,
A:	I was going to make some, uh, like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue.
A:	I don't know if it will come out.
B:	That's,
B:	what kind of fondue, the cheese dip or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	the cheese fondue I make,
A:	some people like swiss, um,
A:	I prefer cheddar.
A:	And I'll mix,
A:	I won't make, I won't have a sharp cheddar because it, for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp, cheddar.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then I was going to make other things like potato skins.
B:	Oh, that sounds good.
A:	see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff.
A:	And, um, I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a, a vegetable.
B:	That's always a good thing.
B:	Vegetable trays always go over so well, because I think people get tired of eating junk.
B:	I mean, I think they like to have healthy stuff too,
B:	you know it's,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party.
B:	Oh, definitely.
B:	I think better even than, than other kinds of food
A:	Yeah,
A:	instead of something greasy or,
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	my, uh, girlfriends do catering
A:	and they always, about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray.
A:	I think they try and suggest it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something, I make, uh, food kabobs.
A:	You take little toothpicks and cut up, uh, pineapple and strawberry, and even banana if you can do it just before you leave.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yes.
B:	Right.
A:	It stays nice and fresh.
B:	Right,
B:	that's true.
B:	Or even have you ever seen where they, they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out, and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like those
B:	Yep.
A:	Um, they, they made a couple of those, uh,
A:	they made one for my, uh, bridal shower
A:	and I was pretty pleased.
A:	I never made one for myself though.
A:	But they look easy enough to make
A:	it's not,
B:	Oh, I think it would, it would be a lot of work
B:	but, um, you know, because it's, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff
B:	but, but I think they're really neat
B:	and, you know, I think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because, you know, when you scrape it, it makes the water.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, something I do is a fruit,
A:	is, I'll get, um, make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have two nieces
A:	and they, they they go melt some chocolate chips,
A:	Go buy me some strawberries.
B:	Is that, is that good?
B:	You know, I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate
B:	but I've never tried it,
B:	are they really good?
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know, if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better,
A:	but if you get a sour strawberry,
B:	Oh, I bet it doesn't mix well, does it?
A:	Huh. Yeah,
A:	no,
A:	they, um, the strawberries are coming in season now from ,
A:	they're, they're coming up from Florida, of course.
A:	I live in Vermont,
A:	so. But they're really reasonably priced,
A:	they're coming up from Florida,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, well, that's good
B:	because I know they've been really expensive lately. Because they weren't in season,
A:	Yeah.
B:	of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think the, uh, actually I think they get, um, some of them from South America.
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Yep,
A:	they,
A:	a lot of, um, of a, um, winter produce comes from South America.
B:	Oh, I .
A:	Of course, their seasons are switched.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	So, um, do you want to discuss the recipe?
B:	Well,
A:	I have a recipe if you want
B:	Okay,
B:	sure,
A:	Um, it filled ,
A:	a lot of people try to stay away from this
A:	but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding.
B:	Is that right?
B:	I've never heard of that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, and it if you, um, well,
A:	first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk
A:	and I put it in a two quart saucepan
A:	and you put it on a really low heat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it, it ends up burning,
A:	I mean, no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't let that worry me.
A:	And I get the milk lukewarm
A:	and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
A:	and I have this thing
A:	it's called the slender blender,
A:	it, it makes the, uh, it makes, uh, a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough.
A:	It's, uh, I don't know,
A:	they're called moo goo leaves or something
A:	they're
B:	I think I know what you're
B:	is it like a hand held?
A:	Yeah.
A:	They're real neat.
B:	The,
B:	yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	I think they're real reasonably priced,
A:	some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars
A:	and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
A:	but I didn't get that one,
A:	I got the Black and Decker kind.
A:	But, uh, it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord
A:	and you beat this cornstarch right into the the milk, you know,
A:	and it does an excellent job,
A:	or just hand beat it.
A:	I guess you could use a hand mixer
A:	but I don't think it I don't think it gets it good enough.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh.
A:	And then before the milk gets too hot, um, I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good. And then about a half a cup of sugar
A:	and I let it pretty much,
A:	I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
A:	and it's, it starts thickening,
A:	when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little, I don't know,
A:	it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch,
A:	and you just keep beating it in.
A:	And it's the,
A:	the trick is, is to have this blender,
A:	so, if you were,
A:	you'd have to probably almost go out
A:	and someone who's just going to make it first time, it's,
A:	you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders.
A:	And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
A:	or after it's thickened I cook it for a good,
A:	once it starts boiling, I just, I cook it for a good seven minutes, seven to ten minutes
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you can make chocolate
A:	or you can take it off and let it cool
A:	you put, um, really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
A:	and that makes french vanilla, um, custard.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	That is really interesting.
B:	Are you saying to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,
A:	A chocolate powder.
B:	unsweetened?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened.
A:	It comes in like a real dark can,
B:	Yeah.
A:	our mothers used to use it.
A:	And then,
B:	I have some
A:	Yeah,
A:	we all used to,
B:	I just want to,
A:	yeah
A:	, it's the unsweetened kind
A:	it's not like Nestles Quik.
B:	Right.
B:	Okay.
A:	I suppose you could use that.
B:	Cooking chocolate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, um,
B:	That's really interesting,
B:	I've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat.
A:	Well, I used to make the regular pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
A:	and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day, where you cut the pie, it would soak into the pie shell
A:	and it was like red,
A:	and I'm like, oh,
A:	this is kind of groedy .
B:	Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
A:	Um, actually I found it in one of my mother's, um, homemade cookbooks,
A:	I mean, something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.
B:	Is that right?
B:	Oh, neat,
A:	So,
B:	that is just really neat.
B:	Because I,
A:	I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater
A:	but, um,
B:	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I still think a beater would do it good enough, um,
A:	the trick is to get the cornstarch,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, yeah
A:	, right in the, in the lukewarm milk.
A:	Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
A:	and I would put it in the sink
A:	and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good.
A:	It seems to be better than putting the, the cornstarch into the liquid
A:	it, once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
B:	So you put the milk in the cornstarch?
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I'll do this, uh,
A:	sometimes I'll put my after I pour that into my, back into my saucepan.
A:	I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg.
A:	So,
B:	And then put that back in the saucepan?
A:	Yep.
A:	And then, you know, if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to. The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more.
B:	Huh that's,
A:	Because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the,
A:	sometimes the cocoa is
A:	like, my husband really likes it thick
A:	he says, I can stick the spoon right in this.
B:	Oh.
A:	Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know,
A:	when you cook a package, it's, it's a little less,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I put it in a nice glass bowl
A:	and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding
A:	so you can put, uh, Saran Wrap over the top.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap,
A:	so, when you pull the Saran Wrap back, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap
A:	and I might put it back on.
A:	But, um,
B:	Do do you put it in the refrigerator then
B:	or
A:	Yeah,
A:	after, well when it starts steaming a lot, uh, I definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, I,
A:	my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.
B:	Right,
B:	that's true.
B:	I knew that.
A:	That's ,
A:	yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, that's why I do that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, well, I don't know
A:	that's my, my great hard recipe.
A:	Okay,
A:	have you ever served as a juror?
B:	Never.
B:	I've never been served on the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I never have either.
B:	You haven't, huh.
B:	If you were, uh, what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers?
A:	Well, I think it's a good idea.
A:	I think our justice system needs a major overhaul,
A:	and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it.
A:	But I think they've got a lot of problems.
B:	I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial.
A:	True.
B:	And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or, or what,
B:	but, uh. Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined,
B:	and they're too easily swayed by their emotion.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's true.
B:	Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES, T V shows.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do, would you prefer all trials by a judge?
B:	No,
B:	I think there are certain things that, uh, the jury can determine as far as, uh, guilty or not guilty,
B:	but as far as the affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature, I don't know if that is best left up to the jury to to award, you know.
B:	Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing, you know, it's true that, you know, this may be sad and all that thing,
B:	but, uh, the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination of guilt and innocence, but not the award of, of penalties and fines and punishment.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would agree with that.
A:	I think you're
A:	I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company,
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's true.
B:	But, uh, I do like the idea of the jury being the, the people who decide in the matter of, uh, if it's a jail term versus life and death you know, the death penalty and such.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	If they give them all the information.
A:	I don't know,
A:	when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if a guy, if the person has a previous record and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sometimes it seems like during the trial part, the jury's not, you know, misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave,
A:	and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it, it, it's kind of difficult,
B:	and I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, uh, some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in, in jail although you still hear about those occasionally.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury?
B:	Um, I don't know.
B:	I, you know, I heard a very interesting,
B:	and maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching,
B:	they were going through a trial,
B:	and I think it was like on one of the, the documentary T V shows where they ask for the, the verdict by the jury
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they went by each one, saying guilty or innocent, guilty or innocent.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they took it more as just like a majority.
A:	Oh.
B:	So I, I,
A:	Some of them disagree,
A:	I mean, some of them said one way and some the other.
B:	Exactly,
B:	but they took, you know, whatever the majority was.
B:	So I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is.
B:	I always thought it had to be unanimous.
A:	I think it does have to be unanimous.
B:	But, uh. Rather interesting.
A:	I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was,
A:	but I thought that they all had to agree
A:	or else they, it was a hung jury.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	I did, I did also.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I I don't know how I feel about that.
A:	I think maybe, uh, majority might be sufficient.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's hard to say though.
B:	What about in international trials.
B:	Do you think they should have a jury there?
A:	Oh.
B:	I think that would be kind of interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I hadn't thought about international trials at all.
B:	I guess the, the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like, you know, the old day with the rack.
A:	Right.
B:	We, they're going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars.
B:	Well, whose going to really make them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Nobody.
A:	Yeah,
B:	So. But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, you know, people from different countries, uh, in as international law also.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street for something like that because of the cultural differences. Things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	I don't know how, what it would take to be, come up with a true perfect system, or if one exists.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, is that the crime
B:	and it's already, some chart and determine the punishment,
B:	or.
A:	Yeah,
A:	like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years.
A:	It's not a discretionary thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think there should be a core minimum that they get
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, uh,
B:	if you sentence someone to life, life is only forty-nine years, something like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I,
B:	And I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole, even though you're in for life.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and sometimes those people are, are young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble.
B:	Yeah,
B:	although I guess it's, you, you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't believe that very often happens.
B:	No.
B:	Because uh, inside the jail there, I don't think there's no real rehabilitation.
A:	I don't think so either.
A:	In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's another war zone.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, who knows.
A:	I think, I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some, some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, you know.
B:	I agree,
B:	get them out there,
A:	Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, you know, world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them,
A:	and,
B:	Sure,
B:	they should have them go out and doing stuff. Cleaning up, or picking up dirt, or weeds, or who knows what. Something for the, for the state,
A:	Yeah.
B:	since the state is paying for them, they should get some kind of, kind of work out of them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Trading their lives for cigarettes those kinds of things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well good.
A:	Well, I think that covers it.
B:	I think so.
A:	Nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you also.
A:	Bye.
B:	Have a wonderful Easter.
A:	You, too.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Well, how many credit cards do you have?
B:	Um, I've only, I've got about four maybe.
B:	I try to limit them because I, well one, I don't use them too much.
B:	And I use my Visa just for for about everything,
B:	and I pay it all off.
B:	So I try not to,
B:	I just use it for free money for thirty days basically.
A:	Sounds like we have no conflict.
A:	We had,
A:	for a while I was carrying one card
A:	and my wife was carrying a different one.
A:	And since the slips all look alike, uh, you commingle them
A:	and then you get the statement
A:	and you try to sort them out, uh,
A:	and it, uh, it caused more confusion about it.
A:	I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time.
A:	And then when A T and T came along and offered a free one, uh, I accepted that,
A:	and we've been using that one.
A:	Uh, the interesting thing is, is that, uh, the amount of money you can can run up on them.
A:	I don't know,
A:	do you know any people that run up big, big bills?
B:	I'm, I'm you know, I'm in the age group you get out of college,
B:	and I think a lot of these people have them maxed out.
A:	Well, did, um, were you able to get one while you're in college?
B:	Um, I don't think I ever tried.
A:	Just curious, because I have a son that's a senior this year,
A:	and he's heading off, with any kind of luck,
A:	but there has been,
A:	I've had a couple of ads for, for, for to provide a card for a college student.
A:	Uh, what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that?
B:	Um, well,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I, you know,
B:	it's, you know, feasible,
B:	I mean, I know a lot of college kids who have them, you know, who had them, but just depends.
A:	Well, that, that, that, I guess from the, from the card issuer, uh, that
A:	since, since it's, it's in, the parent gets it for them, that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible,
A:	but it's,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so basically if you want to take the risk
A:	Yes,
A:	it's whether the parent wants to take the risk.
B:	It's your risk,
B:	do you trust, your, your son,
A:	Yeah,
A:	to, to go run up a big bill
A:	and, the thing is, there some advantages, if he got off some place and stranded.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I'm, I'm leaning towards doing it for, for a convenience,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'd say, you know, have one with, you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the idea that, you know, if he got in trouble, there's some, some ways of getting out, and that he doesn't have to carry cash.
A:	The, uh,
A:	I, I like the idea of credit cards that, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't carry cash around, and, and, uh, I don't even carry checks around.
A:	I let my wife take the checkbook,
A:	and she writes the checks,
A:	and I record them.
A:	So it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, but it's interesting that, uh, the people that can, that can, uh, the amounts of money you can run up on, on credit cards,
A:	and, uh, I, I had recently had some dealings with a fellow that
A:	they had run up, he was making, oh, considered a modest salary for an engineer,
A:	and he had run up, uh, more than a years salary in, in various debts to,
A:	and he wound up declaring bankruptcy
A:	but there,
A:	it, it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty, thirty thousand dollars of, uh,
A:	well, it was a combination of things he had,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	there were, there were several credit cards,
A:	and then there were several other businesses,
B:	The, the extended loan payment for your car.
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I saw that.
A:	The interesting thing about that is, is that, uh, that, that they're encouraging you to incur more, incur more debt,
A:	and,
B:	Well, it's, it's, it's business,
B:	and they're making money off that.
A:	And they make more money if you extend your loan.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, and it's, so it's business,
B:	so, and you notice that they're, they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old.
A:	Yes.
B:	And so they've already shifted the risk.
B:	If they assume that car, then they just have to sell it themselves,
B:	and they'll recover the loan,
A:	And they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service *listen; can't be right transcription
A:	they're not going to keep on if the car were older.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The interesting thing about it is is that from a, uh, uh, an economy standpoint or in economics,
A:	I, I thinks it's, I think it's poor, poor, uh, economics to, to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so. It's interesting that, that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible,
A:	and this year it's ten percent or so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh.
A:	It's, uh, it's interesting that, that, uh, they encourage us to do things,
B:	What, now what's ten percent, we can deduct,
A:	I think ten percent,
A:	yes.
B:	I didn't know that.
A:	Of your, of your consumer credit.
A:	Oh, if you had a thousand dollars, that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you.
B:	I didn't think you could,
B:	any thing on a loan or, I mean a mortgage I know you can,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's on, uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	on the, the,
A:	there's, there's, there's a place for consumer debt
A:	and then you take ten percent of it,
A:	on the,
B:	Oh, I've never itemized yet.
A:	Oh, okay,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And uh, one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if, if you could believe a lawyer or if a,  lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the guy said, Well, can you share it with us what you, what you find so funny?
A:	He says, Well, I already told you my sons a lawyer.
A:	He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine there in Houston.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He told him, Dad, you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you?
A:	His lips are moving.
B:	Oh, my gosh
B:	Oh.
A:	And ninety percent of all politicians,  and lawyers,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have a lawyer background,
B:	yeah.
B:	Have a law background,
B:	you're right.
A:	So by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars.
A:	The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi?
A:	Are we going to lose more lives there?
B:	See, and I don't know, I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it.
B:	I mean I thought the war was going to go on and on.
B:	I really was surprised when it ended so quickly
B:	and,
A:	Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years, the last three years of Vietnam.
B:	I know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume there's nothing they can do about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We were there,
A:	the Brits were there.
B:	Right.
A:	The French were there.
A:	This is with U N backing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and to some level even Russia was behind.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	they were.
A:	So honestly if there is, was a well perceived war, world wide this was it.
B:	Oh, sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight, wouldn't fight.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's not their job to fight for their own land.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is very it's very strange.
B:	Uh, and yet, you know, see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans,
B:	their culture is so much different than ours, you know,
B:	I've heard from many people that we could not even begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
B:	and, um, they just don't think the same way we do.
B:	Their culture is completely different and almost opposite.
A:	And really from all I can from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	that's true.
A:	And the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country.
A:	The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything.
A:	They won't work.
B:	Uh, I didn't realize that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was on the news last night.
B:	Oh, my word.
A:	The, uh, U S Army is doing it all.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	See and that's another question you have to ask, is this our job?
B:	Is, are we, should we still be there even, you know?
B:	I don't know the answers to those questions.
B:	I think they're tough
B:	and I think, you know, it's,
B:	I don't know that anybody knows the answers.
B:	I think they know what they believe
B:	but I'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure.
A:	Well, they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper.
B:	You're kidding.
B:	That's unreal.
A:	And, do you have a housekeeper?
B:	No
B:	No,
B:	and don't plan on having one either, ever.
A:	Well, I wouldn't mind having one.
B:	Oh, I'd love to have one
B:	but, you know.
A:	But, you know, I'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	It, it astound,
A:	you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man, woman, and child money.
B:	Uh, no.
B:	I wasn't, I didn't, wasn't aware of that,
B:	no.
A:	For nothing.
B:	For doing nothing,
B:	yeah.
A:	For for, for doing nothing.
A:	For sitting on there kiesters.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it?
A:	Uh, they do nothing.
A:	They hand them money each year
A:	and they're part of,
A:	I'll let you go first.
B:	Well I think, I don't know how your schools work back there
B:	but we support our schools here with property taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax.
B:	So if you're renting a house or doing anything else, you're not actually contributing to the education of your children.
B:	And I think that's wrong,
B:	I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system.
B:	So, as it turns out, we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, uh, I spent a couple, uh, years down in, uh, Plano, Texas.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death, for the, uh, Plano, uh, school system.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I, you know, I know that Texas doesn't have a state tax,
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	and so all the things come out of the, the property taxes,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I was, uh, really shocked at the amount of taxes I ended up paying.
A:	I was, I was better off paying a state tax back in Maryland, where,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	you would be.
A:	than I was, uh, paying the, uh, property tax down there.
A:	Uh, what they did in Maryland to get around that is they, uh, they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services, that the renters were getting including the, uh, educational services.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, the tax was administered by, uh, the, uh, rental company that actually was managing the apartments
A:	so when, uh, long, long time ago, when I used to live in apartments, I would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month.
B:	Oh.
B:	Gee.
A:	And the tax payment went to pay for the services that I was getting as a, a resident of that particular county.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, that's the way it worked.
A:	Here in Maryland we have, uh, a certain portion of your, your property taxes, uh, goes to education,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in, to pay for the educational system.
B:	Oh, well that's pretty good.
A:	And so it, it works out nice,
A:	it, it, it makes it so that the, uh, whole county now,
A:	I, I know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland, uh,
A:	like Collin County, uh, would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County, here in Maryland.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I mean the, the counties are much larger.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, in the, the whole state of Maryland I believe there's only like, uh, fifteen counties.
B:	Gee whiz.
A:	And, so, uh, you know each county has their own school system an, and it works out real nice.
A:	Um, the, the flip side to this is, are we getting what we're paying for,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I don't believe so, um.
A:	A lot of things have come to head recently
A:	and I heard a report because, of, uh, uh, the emphasis that the President was putting on education, you know, uh, him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education,
A:	in other words, they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, then, at the end of, uh, school year they would be tested
A:	and then they go into the fourth grade
A:	and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So when they came up with these, this nationwide system of public schools, uh, they gave some figures out
A:	and since it's inception, uh, they've, the price has gone up per the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent.
B:	Yow.
A:	And so they're actually spending thirty-three percent,
A:	and that's real dollars, you know, adjusting it back to, to the days, you know, when it started, uh, probably, you know, seventy years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education.
B:	No,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	We've actually gone backwards.
B:	Well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation.
B:	That our high school graduates can't even match the national average.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know, our school system down here is no where near perfect
B:	but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they, they've been having some problems, uh, even here in, uh, like Baltimore City which is, a, a, pretty good good sized city.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, they've been putting a lot of, uh, stress on it
A:	and of course, speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to, you know, do everything they're supposed to do
A:	and of course they've, uh, been cutting the teachers salaries, because they say we don't have the money to do it
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, all the services are costing more money and, and everything, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but uh, a lot of now is being put on, you know, when children used to be taught, you know, like, uh, uh, each child is individual,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you know, they're not all the same
A:	and some students do horrible until like eighth grade,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they need to take things at their own speed.
A:	some do horrible, you know, until they get to like tenth grade,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then all of a sudden everything clicks in, you know.
A:	And then there are some students that, you know, read well at five years old, and, you know, seem to excel.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so that, the, you know, one of the things I heard proposed on, uh, one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed. Some
B:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they can't keep force feeding things to each other and, or, you know, at the kids.
A:	And, and, uh, and on top of that they, they make the child feel inferior, because he's not as good as another kid his same age.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	because he can't do it.
A:	I mean, it's like, you know, that's ridiculous.
B:	And it's not that he can't do it,
B:	he just can't do it quite as fast,
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, you know, I have, uh, I, I have five children total,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I've got two out of the house already
A:	and I I have two that are in, uh, eighth grade this year.
B:	All right.
A:	And prior to their, um,
A:	when I, when they were in elementary school they were identified as being slow.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And so they put them into special programs
A:	and then we actually held them back in fourth grade.
B:	Um.
A:	And it wasn't until the last two years, um,
A:	last year my, uh,
A:	they're they're a set of twins, um, a boy and a girl.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Last year the, the, uh, boy twin started doing real well.
B:	All right.
A:	And it, it, everything started to click in for him
A:	and he knew what he needed to do.
A:	Um, and this year it, it happened for, uh, for the daughter.
B:	Um, all right.
A:	She just has been, really doing great this year
B:	Jumped on out there.
A:	and she has the right attitude towards school and everything.
B:	That's good.
A:	And I think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path.
A:	I remember when I was in school, I did horrible up until about, yeah, about the seventh, eighth grade
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did too, up until ninth or tenth grade.
A:	I, I, I started to, to come around and realize
A:	an, and basically I got interested in math, and, uh, never really did well in english
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and see when I was a kid growing up and going to high school if I wanted to take a little electronics course, I had a electronics course I could take,
B:	but we lived out in the country,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we didn't have all that fancy stuff to worry about, you know,
B:	we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop
B:	and, and, you know, we had just about every thing that we needed
A:	Yeah.
B:	but they don't have it anymore.
B:	There's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore.
B:	our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here
B:	and they go to school four and half days a week,
B:	so. That's pretty weird.
A:	Gee.
A:	Yeah
A:	it is, um,
A:	my children had a, uh, real culture shock, uh, when we lived in Plano,
A:	I guess, I don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district,
A:	but. they're uh, they really stress academics there.
B:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, God, if your child is not an honor student, well then, you're, something wrong with you as a parent.
B:	Gee.
A:	And that's kind of the way they are there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, when we moved back to Maryland, um, I moved to a, uh, a, Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's basically a rural county, once you get above about the half way point.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we lived, you know, in the northern part of the county.
A:	Uh, we went from a, uh, middle school in Texas that served fifty-five square blocks to a, uh, middle school in Maryland that served fifty-five square miles.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it was just a complete culture shock, because I mean, they, they're riding on the bus in the morning with, uh, other kids that, you know, are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores
B:	I can imagine.
A:	and, they you know,
B:	Yeah
B:	that would be quite a shock.
A:	it's,
A:	and they had, uh, ag,
A:	they had an ag course, uh,
A:	I forget what it was called, uh,
A:	but it goes along the, the lines of industrial arts,
A:	but it's, agricultural.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And where they had to raise a small animal.
B:	Oh, like, Four H then.
A:	Had to learn how to drive a tractor.
B:	All right.
A:	They actually had to take a driving test on the tractor,
A:	I mean, they just couldn't believe this
A:	and it was great.
A:	They loved it.
B:	All right.
A:	I mean they really enjoyed the courses, um,
A:	and it, you know, it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain, a drain.
B:	Yeah,
B:	just something you do everyday.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it was, you know.
A:	It was like, kind of like the way we feel about going to work
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	just something I have to do everyday.
A:	But, uh, up here they seem to have made it, uh, a lot of fun for them
A:	and they, they seem to really enjoy it.
B:	That's good,
B:	our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice ...
A:	All right, uh,
A:	you have pets, I understand, a couple of them.
B:	I, I, Well I have, uh, these,
A:	What are they?
B:	well I don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore.
B:	They actually, you know, sort of take over the place
B:	an, and we're kind of their pets.
A:	Pets get like that don't they,
A:	they think they own you
B:	Don't they really?
B:	They own the place
B:	and naturally these are cats,
B:	so.
A:	Okay,
A:	these are cats.
A:	I remember one time, uh, I used to get a chuckle out of, out of Pogo.
A:	That dates me quite a bit,
A:	you probably don't know
B:	Oh, Pogo,
B:	sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he,
A:	when Beauregard was talking he was the dog, remember.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he used to say, pets can be most as much trouble as as kids, if they work at it a little bit, and even more when they work at it a little bit
B:	I agree,
A:	And I think that's true,
B:	I, don't know,
B:	I, I, I think that, um,
B:	my husband and I are in such a situation that, uh, um, I'm kind of, um, not able to do a lot,
B:	I'm, I'm kind of in a wheelchair,
B:	I mean I kind of am,
A:	Oh, uh-huh. just good company, huh, that's neat.
B:	but, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I've got these two cats that hang around with me all day,
B:	and I don't what I'd do without them.
B:	It is
B:	and,
A:	You know it's funny how pets get to be so, uh,
A:	they really, you really do mourn them after, when things happen.
A:	Now we don't actually have a pet right now.
B:	okay.
A:	But, uh, but we have had some
A:	and, and I I
A:	it's always hard for me to believe how close I've gotten to them.
A:	We had a little, uh, uh, oh, dog,
A:	it was a little, uh,
A:	I got it so it wouldn't, wouldn't shed, one of these, French Poodle, a little French Poodle.
B:	Oh my.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, he used to, I used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him, you know,
A:	and I'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping
A:	and he would just dance around the floor
A:	and I just got,
A:	and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car,
B:	Oh!
A:	but I cannot believe the whole family just, he just got in to us so quickly,
B:	Oh!
A:	I could not believe it.
B:	That,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's,
A:	I, I have to tell you about our most interesting pet, though.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, we had an iguana living with us for about, uh, about two years, two and a half years I guess.
B:	Oh, uh, by choice?
A:	It was about, uh, oh, three feet long, about three feet long.
A:	It was a beautiful animal,
A:	name was Clyde.
B:	Clyde the iguana.
A:	Clyde the iguana.
A:	And, uh, my son Dan went to, uh, to, uh, Hawaii for the summer
A:	and when he came home, uh, he didn't bring the iguana with him
A:	but for some reason or other he had a thing for them.
A:	I don't know whether he'd,
A:	I think there was one in the school, uh, zoology department, you know, or biology department, one or the other, anyway, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and anyway, he just, he went and found this guy in, in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in, I guess in in Mexico,
A:	I don't know where.
A:	But anyway he brought this home
A:	and I looked at him
A:	and I said you've got to be kidding, I'm not going to live with a lizard
B:	Yuck!
A:	But you know I visualize that animal racing about,
A:	and you know, like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that.
A:	They're very much like, uh,
A:	well, the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there
A:	and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes.
B:	Did you have him in a cage?
A:	No,
B:	Oh no,
A:	he had full run of the house.
B:	Oh no,
B:	oh no.
A:	He just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the air, the heat came up out of the dryer, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was, he was really a neat pet
A:	and though I, you know,
A:	he'd
A:	when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes
B:	Oh!
A:	And it, it was a long time before I could really pet him
A:	and, but I fed him
A:	and he, he knew how to get me to feed him.
A:	He'd come out to the kitchen, just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator.
B:	Uh.
B:	Oh no,
B:	I mean you don't argue with an iguana, do you.
A:	But he was really a neat animal.
A:	He, he'd lay in Dan's lap, you know,
A:	and just, uh, when he'd pet him, he'd just stretch
A:	and, you know, you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does.
B:	Oh no.
A:	It was kind of interesting.
A:	But he did a lot of interesting things
A:	and, uh, Dan carried him around
A:	and he liked to ride on the back of his, up on his head, you know, with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off, an, and scare everybody to death
A:	and kids loved him,
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	kids just loved him.
A:	Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him
A:	and, and he tolerated them, you know.
A:	He'd even tolerate him petting though,
A:	he didn't like them too well at first,
A:	but he, he got tame, you know,
A:	so that, uh, people could go in there.
A:	And Dan was a drummer,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he didn't, he, the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming.
B:	Was the drumming.
A:	When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up, you know
A:	like he was trying to protect himself,
B:	And cover his ears.
A:	and then he'd leave the room
B:	Isn't that funny the way we put, you know, um, human characteristics on an animal like that
B:	an, an, it's,
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	they really are, they're interesting,
A:	well they take on human characteristics like, uh, our other animal,
B:	I guess they do.
A:	the next year our, our son Ken went to Hawaii
A:	and well, while Dan was in Hawaii, Ken decided he wanted a dog
A:	and he, and he looked around a long while
A:	and he found a Norwegian elkhound
A:	and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound an, home
B:	Oh.
A:	and he was so funny.
A:	Uh, for a while they built a, a run for him out to the side of the house, you know.
A:	He'd been on the patio
A:	but they put the run out there,
A:	and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by
A:	and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him.
A:	And one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him
A:	and, and Hal and I were in bed
A:	and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house
A:	and, and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air And then bark and march around, you know,
B:	He used a classic illusion .
A:	and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water.
B:	I forgot to ask you, did the iguana catch flies for you?
A:	Did what?
B:	Did the iguana catch flies for you?
A:	No,
A:	he didn't eat flies.
B:	He didn't eat flies.
A:	No,
A:	they eat, uh, they eat greens.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce, you know,
A:	I'd get lettuce at the store
A:	and he'd eat the outside leaves.
B:	Oh.
A:	And then in the summertime you could put him out
A:	and he'd eat outside except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up, you know.
B:	I bet
A:	It was really it was s really a of things that were fresh sprigs, you know,
A:	he liked that.
B:	Well can we ask you whatever happened to Clyde?
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	when, uh, when Dan went up to college up at Ricksun , Idaho he took him with him,
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, everybody was used to him
A:	and they just loved him and what not
A:	and this his roommate put him out one day
A:	and Dan didn't know it
A:	and it got dark
A:	and he didn't get him in again.
A:	And they searched and searched and searched for him
A:	but, uh, uh, it got too cold up there
A:	and he, he died in a tree.
A:	they found him the next day in a tree,
A:	but.
B:	Oh, oh my.
A:	So you you have to be pretty tender with them,
A:	we had a, he had his own heat lamp and, uh, and, uh, hot pad he laid on, you know.
A:	That was another funny thing,
A:	he had a hot pad
A:	and it, it burned up one time
A:	and boy, it was, that was funny too, watching him kind of burned up
A:	but anyway.
B:	Uh.
A:	An we got him a new one,
A:	he had a blue one before
A:	and when we got him a new one it was brown
A:	and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers.
B:	Oh, really,
A:	No,
A:	he wouldn't lay on it.
B:	because that was like what he was used to.
A:	so they really are, they really pick up things.
A:	He was, he was a clean animal, uh,
A:	we, he went to the bathroom in the bathroom.
B:	How did he do that?
A:	well we put some papers on the floor, underneath the john
B:	Okay.
A:	and he went there to go to the bathroom.
A:	You had to be sure you left the doors open, you know,
A:	he didn't like to go anywhere else,
A:	he'd, he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door, if you happened to close it on him or something, you know,
A:	but, but even when he went, when he had an accident or something, uh,
B:	Oh, no.
A:	if you just let it dry, it dries kind of like, uh,
A:	especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce, it dried up a little bit like ashes
A:	and you could just vacuum it up.
B:	Oh my goodness.
A:	In the winter time there was no smell at all, no odor at all to it.
A:	And in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But, uh.
B:	But that, that's incredible.
B:	It's a different little things,
A:	Yeah,
A:	he is, he was a really interesting animal.
B:	Oh, that's,
A:	I, I just, uh we just really
A:	and you know, to this day I still miss him
A:	and that's been years ago.
B:	Well see, I guess it's because you lived with, you know, him an, and overcame some fears to get used to him.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he was just,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think, I guess so.
A:	But it's, it was interesting.
B:	Yeah
A:	Well, what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them
B:	Oh, my goodness, these guys, they, well actually they're my husband's pets.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Oh, and you just kind of took them, over, huh.
B:	Well, well actually it's like he's the cat person you know,
B:	and I've, I was always kind of nondescript in that category because I always liked dogs.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And they've kind of taken over
B:	and, and, uh, you know.
A:	A little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country, though isn't it,
A:	uh. I think,
B:	Maybe it is,
B:	I,
B:	they're so independent,
B:	well I'm glad we have two of them, otherwise, I think they get neurotic if there just one of them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that could be, could be.
B:	They get real crazy.
B:	But there, brother and sister from the same litter.
B:	They look totally different,
B:	they are, they are, well they are Siamese cats,
A:	Oh, pretty ones.
B:	but one is, one is, uh, um,
B:	they're both registered, you know,
B:	one's a seal point,
B:	she's the little girl
B:	and then, uh, Newhart is the, uh, the, the,
A:	Newhart,
B:	he is something.
B:	He's like a dog,
B:	he really, he just he just wants his belly scratched
B:	and that's it, you know.
B:	And he's just the warmest thing in the wintertime,
A:	Yeah,
B:	he just sits on your lap, sits on your lap,
B:	but they're like seven ...
A:	Tell me what books you read.
B:	Oh, boy
B:	Well, um, I haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately.
B:	I read, uh, one book a friend recommended to me.
B:	I can't even remember the guy's name.
B:	It was a science fiction, Dean Cole, or something like that.
B:	And it was so frightening
B:	and it had so much violence in it
B:	I just  could hardly stand it
A:	Um.
A:	I try to avoid the,
B:	Yeah
B:	I didn't think it was so great.
B:	She thought it was riveting, you know,
B:	but, I couldn't deal with that.
B:	But, um, mostly I read,
B:	I'm a marriage and family counselor
B:	and mostly I read things to do with raising kids,
B:	and now I have two little kids,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or co-dependency, or, you know, fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on, uh, THE FAMILY and HOMECOMING and INNER CHILD, and so
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I read usually that kind of stuff.
B:	If,
B:	and right now I'm reading, um, Judith Viorst's book called NECESSARY LOSSES, where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and so,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	in in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old  I, I read
A:	That does cut into your,  reading time a lot.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's really changed my reading habits, because I used to read so much, especially when I was in school.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, but, gosh it's, uh, it's getting pathetic now
B:	If,  I get through a magazine, I've been,
A:	Well my,  my kids are up, and out of the house now.
A:	So, you know, I will, uh, encourage you that you do get a little more time to yourself later on
B:	Yeah.
A:	I,  won't say what.
B:	Later you're,  probably looking for your kids
B:	so you can talk to them when they're out running around with friends
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What do you read?
A:	Oh, uh, well, I read for a living.
A:	Uh,  I'm an editor.
B:	You do?
B:	Who,
B:	Oh, well how interesting.
A:	And  so, I, I'm at the
B:	What kind of books?
A:	Center for Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences and therefore, I read, uh, psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, philosophy, linguistics, history, uh,
B:	Um.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	yeah,
A:	and you name it.
A:	I've read some of it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well that sounds like a fascinating job.
A:	It really is.
A:	It's,  it's a great place to be
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the, uh,
A:	it's nice to work with people uh, who are not required to use your services, and so therefore, are grateful and not arguing with you about them.
A:	If they don't, want an editor, they don't come
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's true.
B:	Well, you probably,
B:	I, I seem to remember that, uh, little byline on a lot of things I've read.
A:	Um.
B:	Um, is, is, is that, um,
B:	do they have a mail kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the,  social,
A:	No.
A:	We, don't.
B:	No?
A:	Uh, normally we don't publish, uh, things under our own imprint.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, we have books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different, uh, commercial and academic publishers and university presses.
B:	That sounds so familiar.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, I end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through, sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I also get, of course, lots of references to neat stuff to read about.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I'm, uh, I was just thinking when they told me the topic, I should just, I should read the, uh, titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that I'm in the middle of.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh,  that sounds interesting.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh
A:	it causes the, uh, uh  Saint Anthony's Fire Disease, where,  people fell into fits
B:	I thought that was going to be
B:	Oh.
A:	and, There is a, a theory, at least, that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of erga.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Huh.
A:	And a book called JOB CUES, GENDER CUES, which explains, uh, how certain professions and vocations get, uh, flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other,
A:	like uh, nursing,  started out all men and then in the nineteenth century, began to have women.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Nursing
B:	or,
A:	And now it's practically all women.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that, uh ,
B:	Secretaries.
B:	I bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business.
A:	That's right.
A:	And the,  thing that changed that was the manual typewriter.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It then it became, you see, just sort of a clerical task.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	When you wrote it out in long hand you were a,
B:	Then you were important
A:	Yes.
A:	You were a confidential assistant to the, person.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Like the scribes who did the old documents, you know, for churches and,
A:	Right.
B:	yeah
A:	And then, I've got a book called FASHIONS IN SCIENCE, which is a sociology that explains, uh, why certain theories get to be popular in, uh, sociology. And, uh, how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers
B:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I have one novel that's called FIRST LIGHT,
A:	that's about, uh, archaeology  the British novel.
B:	Um.
A:	So, it's really quite interesting.
A:	I haven't,  got too, far into it yet.
B:	Gosh.
B:	Really.
B:	So, are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts,  that have not been
A:	Uh, those are,  all books that are out, uh, published and bound now.
A:	But, they're just things, that, , pertain to various things I'm working on or were, uh, mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity.
B:	Huh.
A:	So I got them out of the library and decided I'd read some more in them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My goodness.
B:	Well, that's fascinating.
B:	Gosh.
A:	So, I read a lot of history and, uh, a few novels, occasional mystery stories, just,  for fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	I never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff.
B:	My husband reads a lot of the, um,
B:	well, he did before we had kids  the STAR TREK, and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of, things, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, he's got a, quite a collection of those.
B:	But, uh, my stuff uh, revolves around, uh, one one let's see,
B:	I've got one called ONE THOUSAND PRACTICAL PARENTING TIPS,  which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces, in your kid's shoes
A:	Oh, hey.
A:	That's, a nifty idea.
B:	Hey,
B:	I've done that to every pair my three year old has.
A:	Great.
B:	You know, really.
A:	Oh, I think the,  the boom to parents and the, the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs
B:	And, uh,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's incredibly .
B:	but there's a surprising number that are still around that aren't, that don't have those,
B:	so that's an alternate means of dealing with
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, I'm trying to think of what else I've got.
B:	Uh, since I'm, um, a therapist and all, I've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups.
B:	So, I've got all the different alcoholics, what they call the blue, the blue book, the big book, and all the O A literature and all the CODA literature,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I'm trying to get more familiarized with that because I refer clients and different groups
B:	and, uh, well, let's see I'm trying to think of the,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think is, the most promising, or practical book, uh, of that kind you've read recently?
B:	Um, Oh, I I have a love affair with John Bradshaw.
B:	I just have found everything I've read of his to be fabulous,  um,
A:	Um.
B:	he started out with one called THE FAMILY, which does the family systems and people's roles in the family.
B:	And then he did, uh, HEALING THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU, about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then the third one that he came out with is now called HOMECOMING
B:	Uh, and, uh, there's a subtitle to it,
B:	I never can remember what it is.
B:	It's something like, um, A JOURNEY IN, IN YOUR INNER, CHILD or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I knew, his literary agent in Houston when she was just, uh, convincing him to write all this down.
A:	He was  teaching,
B:	Oh,  he's just great.
B:	And now he's had the, the first, the first one and the third one put into a ten session, uh, P B S series.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I I saw one of those episodes on P B S.
A:	Uh,  from time to time out here, we have four different P B S channels that we can get on the cable
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, they'll have all ten of those shown back to back, in the middle of the night for people can video tape them.
B:	Oh.
B:	I know
B:	Yeah,
B:	so people can just tape them I guess,  you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, I definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately
B:	He's just probably been one of the most,
B:	there's an author that's in, um, that's in, uh, Arizona, who used to be in Dallas.
B:	It seems like we have a lot of these that have been in  Texas, called P M Melody, who does a lot of writing on co-dependency.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and, uh, a workbook called BREAKING FREE, and just some real, uh, helpful, practical things for co-dependency.
A:	Huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's been another one that I've thought was real helpful. But, other than that, uh, my reading centers on PADDINGTON BEAR, and WINNIE THE POOH,  and   DOCTOR SEUSS
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, I really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more, uh, new things out that, you know,
B:	I, I'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids,
B:	but there's such cute things,  out for kids.
A:	Oh, there's some,  absolutely wonderful illustrated,  children's books.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	And I just go to the library because I just, they're expensive,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, it,
B:	and they go through them so fast,  you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I just, I really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out
B:	and they just love to sit and read.
B:	And now finally the littlest one is oldest to, to sit, you know, and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying,  to rip the pages out.
A:	right.
A:	Uh , well,
B:	So, that, that has been fun to do do that you,  know, go through the children's literature,  and, uh  uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I read,  THE PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY, uh, which lists all the upcoming books, forthcoming books,
A:	and,  uh, there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I was tickled to see that some publisher is, uh, reprinting the, the James Thurber books for children. THE,  WONDERFUL O and THE THIRTEEN CLOCKS, that have been out of print for about, oh, I think about twenty years.
B:	Oh, wonderful.
B:	Gosh.
B:	Really?
B:	Well, I'm going to have to,  look for those.
A:	Well,  I had those for my kids
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they really did, enjoy them.
B:	Oh.
A:	Oh, but they were, old copies then.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't buy them when my kids were little.
A:	And so, they probably were out of print all of, already when my kids were small.
A:	But, um, I, was really happy to see that,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah,
A:	I guess it's in honor of his hundredth,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I
A:	I mean, what thoughts do you have on the subject?
B:	Uh, you know, we even lived there for a, a while when my husband was in the Navy.
A:	Oh, you did?
B:	In fact the first year we were married, he was already over there, had been there two years when we got married
B:	and so our,  we had a one year honeymoon.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, Uh, it was very nice, um.
A:	That's wonderful.
A:	Well do you have, you probably have a different sense than I have.
A:	I went to an inner city high school in Chicago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and that's not where I am originally from.
A:	It was a divorce situation of my parents.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it was a, a cultural shock to me.  Uh, in terms of what I went through.
B:	I'm sure.
A:	The high school is now called, in fact, it was called Tulley High School
A:	and now it's called Roberto Clemente
B:	Roberto died while we were down there as a matter of fact.
A:	That, yeah, that's exactly, about twenty years now.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, what was it like living there,
A:	I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being,
B:	It's like anywhere else.
B:	People are individuals
B:	and I find it really difficult an, and, frustrated trying to make stereotypes, you know.
A:	Right,
A:	I agree with that,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, I can understand the, the frustration you must have gone through, uh, going to the, the school, uh.
A:	I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	it's just,
B:	if, if it's not part of your culture,  and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for,  uh, the
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had gone to a very, uh, uh, um, conservative, uh, college
B:	and when I started teaching school it was in an inner city situation,  although it was not Puerto Rican, it was, uh, a Mexican American and black students.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with
B:	so it was,  it was very, very, different.
A:	Right,
A:	that you had ever been.
A:	Right,
A:	I mean, I'll give you and idea that I had, um,
A:	and I would say, I would say the ones, the majority appreciated what they were having in this country.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but a lot of the ones that didn't even in the minority, not in the sense of the cultural world, word, they made it worse for the other kids in school.
A:	And, you know, Chicago, back then, even had bilingual classes.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I mean, I had geometry,
A:	the teacher was from Cypress Greece
A:	and,  it was, Spanish and English,
B:	Huh.
A:	so if you can imagine how I even
B:	Oh, my.
A:	And, I mean, and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, but I think basically, I think they should leave things the way they are right now,
A:	I mean, I don't really have enough in terms of an argument, pro or con in terms of making any type of change.
B:	I'm not, so much against their making, uh, it a state.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I would want a very, very, very clear majority,
B:	because if the minority can be so, vociferous, whether you're talking this group, or, or,  any other group that, that has a stake in something.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	that's exactly.
B:	And they can make, as you said, uh, so well, the, a, a few can make it so miserable for everybody else.
A:	And that's exactly,
A:	I mean, I can remember instances that, uh, wasn't as, uh, you know, bad,
A:	Lord, I don't know how it would be today.
A:	Well I know what it looks like,
A:	I've been back up for a reunion.
B:	That, that my give you a clue.
A:	It does,
A:	yeah,
A:	um, but its', but it's an experience I wouldn't change,
A:	I mean my husband, um, grew up in, um, a majority, uh, WASP, southern Ohio, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that, um,
A:	when he saw where I, you know, saw my later teenage years, he was just, I hate to say aghast, because that sounds so trite,
A:	but he was.
A:	And yet, how did I turn out the way I did turn out.
B:	Yeah,
A:	And I said that's really irrelevant.
A:	What you find is that, um, if you can talk to like,
A:	I mean, I learned a lot about the, um, Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids.
A:	You know, and you lived there
A:	so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor.
B:	Same as, as any other part of the world,
A:	Like here, yeah,  it's the same.
B:	really.
B:	I, I don't, I don't think it's really to their best interests,  to, uh, uh, attain statehood as it is right now,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they have the best of both worlds.
B:	They have, uh, representation,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do.
A:	This is true.
B:	Uh, being that it's an island economy, um,
B:	everything is imported
B:	and yes, the cost of living is super high,
B:	but, but they're protected in so many ways without having to, to pay for the rights and privileges.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I know what you're saying,
A:	yeah,
B:	So, so you know, I, I would just as soon,
B:	an, an, and, if, if they voted to, for independence, I would back them a hundred percent.
B:	And that's,  that's, because, I, I guess, because I'm not into territorialism or whatever, that we have been in the past.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	I probably would say the something if I knew that intellectually that it was good
A:	and emotionally that the people there wanted it.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, it's just, um,
A:	I mean, right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States, don't they.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	They count, yeah, as a principle,
A:	that's what I thought.
A:	Um, but I've also been down there.
A:	We traveled a lot to the B V I, the British Virgin Islands.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, um,
A:	and it's just, it's, I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States, um, privileges, some of our resources. The educational, the teachers, the, um,  academic opportunity, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't think we do do enough of a resource transfer, if there is such a thing.
B:	Part of that though has been, I think, uh, selected by, by them,  in that, that whereas they want the benefits of some of, of what the continentals can offer,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they,  they want to maintain that, um, culture of theirs,  which, which I understand.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and so often when you, when you bring in the advantages, the resources and so forth, there, there is a trade.
A:	They'll lose their ethnicity as they say,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's,
B:	Most of the people who that that I know about who really, uh, would, favor statehood,  have pretty much assimilated into the, the continental states already.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See,
B:	Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
B:	and, and it's not that much of a strain,
B:	and,  you know, they're kind of lackadaisical about it.  At least at the present time.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's the way, the way the pendulum seems to be swinging, right now.
A:	It sounds like you probably know
A:	I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with,
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	we really didn't keep that up,
B:	it's just,
A:	No,
A:	that's natural,
A:	I just thought I'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think.
B:	Um.
A:	Because I really don't have any, um, personal or professional or familial ties down there.
A:	I don't know, the the, the, the, that's just children, but the, the people that I went to high school with, um, I think the majority are in that, the, probably the generation, yours and mine
A:	and the one right after us, that, um, their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States.  Um, in terms of retaining, um,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and my background's European heritage
A:	and their background it would be, you know, the, I guess I would say the Latin or Latino heritage.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not speaking in English, um, having the children drive them everywhere, and these were not old people.
A:	These were like in their early forties.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, and I always, that always bothered me
A:	and then there were some children that I noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school, I mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live.
A:	You know, they had made enough money here.
B:	And so
A:	But on the other hand, I guess it's all about choice in everything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, was it,
A:	I mean how were they toward,
A:	that's interesting the, the way, term you used continentals, which I'm sure is the proper term.
A:	How were they toward the United States in terms of just general, relationships,
A:	I mean, were they glad?
B:	There really were three major, um, camps,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there were those who, who, uh, were very friendly, very open, any, anything we can do for you, uh, uh,
B:	either way, you know, was great.
B:	And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that, ho hum, whatever,  you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, it, it was interesting,
B:	the whole time we were there it was very, very political.
B:	There was always some, on Sunday afternoons, uh, going through the, all the little urbanizations, the little neighborhoods with, uh,  blow horns, oh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't think of the term
B:	but, you know.
A:	I know what you're talking about
A:	yeah.
B:	And with banners and, and a parade of vehicles with their, with their colors of the,  of a particular party.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they were very, very, um, passionate,  about their beliefs
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it, it, it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see,
B:	I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that, that stayed.
B:	It seemed to shift as, as,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't, I don't predict,
A:	what you're describing is actually a conflict, very
A:	hello, uh,
A:	you know what,
A:	I've got to go, because that's my cordless battery going.
B:	Oh, oh, I see,
B:	okay
A:	I'm sorry
B:	Well I have enjoyed it.
A:	I enjoyed talking to you
A:	and, uh, thank you for your time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, I think health care is real important, and dental coverage,
A:	but I guess medical insurance is probably what I consider the second most important.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree on that.
B:	And, you know, it seems
B:	compared to what we, our salary is versus what our health care is, our health care keeps increasing, increasing, increasing and not to the same rate as our pay
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	I know
A:	no matter what you do about that, yeah, unless you're like a Senior V P or something which I am not
B:	Right.
B:	Me either
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
A:	It's, um,
A:	I don't know.
A:	And then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people, um, expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they'll say maybe we'll pay you X amount annually,
A:	but then we, you know, ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits
A:	and if you're like,
A:	are you married?
B:	Yes.
A:	Um, like my husband works,
A:	and I do
A:	so I don't take some of,
A:	I have certain things that I take,
A:	and he has other things he takes.
B:	Right.
A:	So I mean in that kind of situation it's really almost, redundant, you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know that some of the benefits, I would rather have, um, money.
B:	Money instead.
A:	Yeah,
A:	more money, actually, um,  Or flex time or something that was a little more personal, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	I feel the same way, actually.
B:	Um, we don't use any of T I benefits other than I, I buy bonds and, and, um, that's it
B:	because,
A:	You don't use, you don't use the medical insurance?
B:	Not at all.
A:	You use your, your company's?
B:	My husband's,
B:	yes,
B:	we use my husband's.
A:	Where does he work if you don't mind me,
B:	He, he works for Bramalea Company,
B:	and they pay one hundred percent.
B:	Not one dime is deducted from his check.
A:	Oh, you're kidding.
A:	What's the name of that company
B:	Bramalea.
A:	What do they do?
B:	It's a security company
B:	and, and building, they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And,
A:	Are they a big Company
A:	or,
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually they're from Canada.
B:	They're Canada based.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's, see, that's probably why cause Canada has the, the, um, government run health care systems, social medicine.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you don't pay them. If you live there,
A:	it's like Europe.
A:	You don't pay a dime.
B:	Right.
A:	You know?
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's all taken care, Yeah, but our prescriptions and everything, our visits to the doctor, our hospitalization,
A:	Sounds wonderful.
B:	the only thing we pay for is if if something happened, an emergency, and we had to have an ambulance,
B:	it's twenty-five dollars.
B:	I mean that's nothing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if I were, him, I'd tell him make sure he stays there.
B:	Really,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, T I was getting, for the both of us, it was like seventy-five dollars a month.  You know, deducted for an H M O,
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I don't work at T I.
A:	My husband works at T I,
A:	but, um, I work for E D S,
A:	but it's like, um,
A:	You know they're both
A:	basically, E D S is a little bit better than T I
A:	but,  Um, and we take my dental, my dental, his medical.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the medical is just, I mean, I think it's terrible, you know?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	twenty,
A:	but they're, then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, I don't know.
A:	I just don't think companies, um, they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system
A:	and, you know,  Um, T I just did the thing where, with the smoking premiums.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We don't smoke,
A:	but did you, do you know about the smoking premiums?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	do you guys smoke?
B:	We don't either.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Neither one of us do.
A:	But then,  you know, like a lady in my office said, she said her husband works for T I, too.
A:	And she said what about the people that are walking around,
A:	and I hope,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, who's going to croak first? The people that smoke or, you know?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Seems like,  an unnecessary penalty,
B:	Exactly.
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean I'm not all for smoking at all,
A:	but I just, you know,  I don't how they can do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Carte blanket . *listen: probably closer to "carte blanche"
B:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's like, stupid,
A:	but, That's why I'm not a boss, I guess
B:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean I don't know, um.
A:	What other, what other type of benefits do they have that, I mean, Canadian based companies .
A:	They have to be a little bit different than the American, um.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are as far as their like pension plans ,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they're vested a lot earlier.
B:	I think at T I, it took five years.
A:	Yeah,
A:	T I is at least, five years,
A:	yeah.
B:	Five to seven.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they're vested after their first year. totally vested.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And they have the four one K and the usual benefits like that, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's kind of nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	T I has that,
A:	but that's a pretty standard thing anymore.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	You know, um, um, your husband's company probably matches more than T I, though.
B:	No,
B:	they match the same amount.
A:	Oh, they do ?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, they match four percent which is the same,  You know, fifty percent or four percent. *listen; particularly nonsensical
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	That's still pretty good, though. I mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know, um,
A:	E D S has eight years?
A:	I think E D S has seven to, to eight years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it's like T I in that respect, you know?
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and, I mean, and I'm working for a company that's making money
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know,  E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but,  um, not E D S, T I, um,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I, I don't know.
A:	I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people, the grunts, as I call them, like myself to tell them,
B:	Right.
A:	yeah.
A:	I mean,  I don't know,
B:	It's,
A:	but if I were to rank them, I guess I would say next to income it's really just health benefits.
A:	And then, um, for most people I know it would be day care
A:	like T I has,  no day care.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, and I know that's a big issue
B:	because I, I belong to a women's forum group.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And some of the questions we're getting are, are on site day care and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That they consider a very serious benefit.
B:	And I can't tell you anybody right now at T I that's, uh, considering that.
A:	Oh, I don't,
A:	I would, think so,
A:	yeah
A:	because,
B:	They should be though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they really should because they're big enough, um,
A:	and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at, I think, right now than, that we have day care, um, they, uh, the health, the health program like T I has Texans?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But it, I don't think it, that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean if you ever walked into E D S health, corner court health clubs on site and you walk into Spring Creek, well, Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but,   I mean, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot better.
B:	E D S is is better than Spring Creek?
A:	Oh, it's really nice,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh, man.
A:	You know, instead of like six, um, treadmills, you've got like twenty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And E D S can't even compare in size. In terms of the number of employees.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	People,
B:	yeah.
A:	So I, don't know.
A:	I guess it's just where they, um, and like E D S reimburses you for adoption.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And T I doesn't have anything like that.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, so I guess I, I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect
B:	Yeah.
A:	so,
B:	That's good.
B:	That's a, that's a fortunate benefit, you know, that they're so active for their employees.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and there's, I mean they have some strange things.
A:	I mean they have very strange like dress codes
A:	and, you know.
B:	Um, uh-huh.
A:	Um, you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	but it doesn't, there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I don't know.
A:	I, I guess I also wish that, uh, companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews.  Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Me, too.
B:	Me, too,
B:	because, you know, with utilities and, and homes that are, uh,
B:	price of homes have went up drastically.
B:	Like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand.
A:	exactly.
B:	And that is unreal,  because we've got people out here that are just poverty level.
A:	I know.
B:	But then we've got these million dollar homes
B:	so you know, where do you find a happy medium?
A:	I know.
B:	And how does your salary deal,  with that?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and I mean,  I mean, I don't know how you and your husband are, too,
B:	It's just not doing it.
A:	but I mean we have friends that laugh at us
A:	and we, I clip coupons.
A:	And I said, hey, I'll probably do this even if I'm a millionaire which I won't,  ever be.
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah
A:	But, I mean, it's like,
A:	because you just can't,
A:	I mean, it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something well, the car insurance is due
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
B:	That is exactly where we are.
A:	I mean,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's so strange
A:	I know.
A:	I don't know what we're going to do about,
B:	Common problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you,  want to rob a bank?
A:	No,
A:	I didn't say that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
A:	I didn't say that on this line.
A:	I don't know.
A:	What else about corporate benefits?
A:	I can't think.
A:	It's probably been too hot today for either of us to,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas.
A:	Usually people are all over the country.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	and I think Dallas, as far as, um, economic uncertainty, is better than what most of the country is.
A:	This is true.
B:	So somehow, we're better off than a lot of them.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and that doesn't definitely make it any better.
A:	It's,  just something you have to keep telling yourself, you know, that, um, that's what I want, that, uh, you know,
B:	No
A:	people are lucky to have jobs,
A:	and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When you see people that don't have, um, anything but H M O or, you know, I mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs,
A:	like, we had a guy fixing our air conditioner.
A:	And he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour,
A:	and he has three kids.
A:	And I went, oh, you know, that has to be rough.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but benefits,
A:	I don't know.
A:	I guess, I guess one thing I'd like to see, too, and I, I don't know how T I is about this, but I'd like to see, um, employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their, um, the execution of their job.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
B:	Empowerment issues.
A:	Right yeah,
A:	that's a good word for it, um.
B:	Right.
A:	How is T I in that mode?
B:	Well, very well, um,
B:	it's slow, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	At least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and, cultural change within the management first.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level.
B:	But, uh, I think they're really trying.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's going to take years, though.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean it's just, it's that mind-set,  has to change,
A:	All part of a good old boy network,
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	E D S is, oh, they're better,
A:	but they're a little bit too, um, stiff collared in terms of, you know, what you want to do.
A:	They're pretty much put the, if that's where the widget goes, stick it in the hole, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're kind of formula oriented.
B:	Doesn't want to change.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful
A:	so, You know, what can you tell them
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess that's what I know about benefits.
B:	Okay. Yeah,
A:	Okay
B:	me, too.
B:	good talking to you.
A:	Good talking to you
A:	and keep cool.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Okay.
B:	Bye-Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-Bye.
A:	Uh, I guess my feelings are that, uh, we almost have a universal health care system, uh, to a great degree, except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people, because I'm sure that some of them don't, uh, don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves,
A:	so, uh, I, I have a feeling, since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get, that this, uh, then becomes an obligation of the government,
A:	because it's going to become an obligation of either state, local or federal government, anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because when people can't pay, they end up going to clinics or, you know, to public hospitals, and that kind of thing,
B:	and, you know,
A:	Well, it seems to me that, that I'm paying anyway, because when I go, or my insurance carrier, anyway, when I pay something, the bills seem inordinately high.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And myself, I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that sounds like a good idea.
B:	My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government,
B:	I don't know
A:	Well   well, who, who else is going to do this, then?
B:	Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've heard all these stories about,
A:	I travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in Europe every year,
B:	Oh.
A:	and I find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people I talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity,
A:	and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
B:	Yeah.
A:	As a matter of fact, if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm, say in Germany or France, uh, that, I'm automatically taken care of,
B:	Wow.
A:	I mean I don't even have to pay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures
B:	People, um, you know, just go on and on and on.
B:	I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care
B:	or, and it just extends with if it, what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on
B:	becomes just this horrendous, you know, burden on the taxpayers.
B:	They're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.
A:	Well I,  uh, uh, I know it.
B:	Well, you know
A:	I have a solution, you see.
A:	my solution,
A:	even though I'm rapidly approaching the, uh, the age when I'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid, I, I,
A:	my mother and father both, uh, uh,
A:	well, my father's not living but my mother is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they are, um, of an advanced years,
A:	and when I see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid,
A:	I mean, the,  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and the extraordinary amounts,
A:	I know that,
A:	because those people vote,
A:	I mean, they're the ones who get out and vote,
A:	that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care.
A:	The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, I think,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
B:	Oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through.
B:	When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, and, I mean, a chiropractor got it in one time
A:	That's right,
A:	I mean, it does,  seem like we're,
B:	it was just strange.
A:	now I noticed just the other day in the paper that, that Medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness.
A:	So I
B:	Oh, well, that should help.
A:	Well, I don't know, uh,
A:	we'll see how that goes.
B:	Yeah
A:	I think that was just a regulation that was up for comment,
A:	but we'll see what happens.
B:	Oh I see
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Well, listen, uh, I think I've, I've exhausted my, uh, self on,
A:	at least I've blown off steam of the way I feel about it.
B:	Okay,
B:	well
A:	Okay?
B:	Okay,
B:	thank you.
B:	Bye-bye
A:	See you next time.
A:	Bye.
A:	Well, I know that, uh,
A:	I have only like two or three favorite television shows.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who does like L A LAW
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	and, uh, he also did HILLSTREET BLUES.
B:	Yeah,
A:	I like those type of shows.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we really enjoy that too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't get a lot, to watch a whole lot of T V.
B:	We have a couple of young children,
B:	and so we're usually outside,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed, we usually watch that,
B:	and L A LAW is one of my favorites.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	me, too.
A:	I know,
A:	they, uh, I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns, they start showing some of their newer stuff.
B:	Yeah
A:	So I thought that was really interesting the way that they did that.
A:	Oh, and so you must watch a lot of, uh, Disney or cartoons then?
B:	Well, we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,
B:	and I think those programs are really good for children.
B:	I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing, you know, not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff
A:	Right.
B:	and they usually, uh, show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	My older son, he's going to be five,
B:	and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now.
A:	Oh, that's true,
A:	that's true.
A:	Well, I noticed that, my kids are, uh, older now,
A:	they're uh, getting close to the teenage years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But they did,
A:	we watched all of MISTER ROGERS and everything,
A:	but even some of your, uh, cartoons can be very violent
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, they talk about death,
A:	and, we were watching, uh, oh gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, um, I think it was on, I have to remember which channel,
A:	but anyway, uh, we were watching that
A:	and it was talking about opera,
A:	and they showed like what they thought an opera would be,
A:	and one of the things was to kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit
B:	Oh.
A:	and I thought, Oh, how violent, you know, to kill the rabbit.
A:	So he ended up killing the rabbit in the end, uh,
A:	but then of course, the rabbit comes back to life and says, well, see this is how an opera is supposed to be.
A:	And I thought, gee whiz, if a little kid was watching this, you know, that would be pretty violent even for a small child.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	and you know, they, especially boys, I mean, they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	And showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right.
A:	Well, I don't think cartoons portray that
A:	but like,
B:	No,
B:	and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend, I think is the hardest part, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
A:	A cat has nine lives
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they don't,
A:	they just have one like we do
A:	Oh, so that's really funny
A:	but, uh we've gotten,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	go ahead.
B:	I was just going to say, I know that, at least before our kids were born, we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW,
B:	Thursday nights usually had pretty good, with that, and as far as very good comedy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids are in bed by then.
A:	Yes,
A:	Yes,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's true,
A:	that's a good show.
A:	I used to watch, uh, DALLAS.
B:	We're, we're in Dallas.
A:	yeah.
A:	I used to watch DALLAS, years ago.
A:	And somewhere in the middle I got, uh, bored,
A:	and, uh, so I, in fact, I didn't even watch the finale.
A:	Uh, you know, that's about how disinterested I had become.
B:	Yes.
B:	Well, I did watch it just to see what it was
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it wasn't really that great.
B:	So.
A:	Well,
B:	I think, after a while, they just kind of, you know, there's no new stuff they can do,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they've done everything dirty in the book you know,
A:	Yep.
B:	so,
A:	Yep,
A:	I know,
A:	I know.
A:	Was it actually based on a book?
B:	Well, no,
B:	I imagine,
A:	Oh, but you were just talking about,
A:	okay,
A:	okay,
B:	Everything you could think of, you know had a hard time,
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true.
B:	Where,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I never watched KNOTS LANDING,
B:	but I think they've had a lot of their characters stay around.
A:	Stay.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, and if you notice on DALLAS, they lost all the women.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	So the men mainly stayed
A:	but the women were the ones who left,
A:	and I thought that was very interesting and wondered, kind of wondered about that.
A:	Uh, well, anyway that's a whole new issue
B:	Yeah
B:	Oh.
A:	Oh, goodness
A:	so. Anyway. I don't know if our five minutes are over yet
A:	But we, uh, we also have the paid, uh, television channels.
A:	Uh, the only thing I don't like about it, especially with teenagers, is that all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, I know they didn't pick up these curse words from me.
A:	So, uh, they had to have picked them up from, uh, the T V.
B:	Yeah.
A:	One nice thing though about the cable company we use, they have, uh, they have that little parental, uh, uh, key,
B:	Where you can lock up, the channel or whatever?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	So, I, I have that at home,
A:	and I keep the keys with me.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's about the only way that I can, that I can do it.
A:	Because their natural curiosity, you know, to go towards that way and want
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now,
B:	I mean I just think they watch so much more T V.
B:	I try to limit what they watch.
B:	They aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day because I think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff, too.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings.
B:	It's the only cool time to be outside
A:	That's true,
A:	well, and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high.
B:	Well, true,
A:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you, too.
A:	Okay,
A:	talk with you later.
B:	Okay.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Good-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, does, is this something that concerns you?
B:	or Well, I think it does, um, especially because I just moved to Massachusetts and, uh, they're having real problems because they have so many, uh, police layoffs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, personally I don't live in a real bad section of town
B:	but, uh, just because of the general area I live in, the insurance rates are real high on your car
B:	and, there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me
A:	Right
B:	How about you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I live outside of Dallas
A:	and it's kind of in a little suburb.
A:	So, I feel pretty safe out here
A:	but I know the murder rate is going up every year  in Dallas
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, uh.
A:	and that worries me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I recently moved here
B:	and when I was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in, the, in the worst areas of town
B:	and, uh, my husband, was, was,
B:	what he his concerns were
B:	well not that I think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander, just to be in that location
B:	and I thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and a lot of kids, you know, are caught that way.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects, which is  you know, sort of a bad area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But he was just out riding his Big Wheel
A:	and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun
A:	and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that   exactly what happened down here.
A:	That's really sad.
A:	I've,
A:	so you know it must be  frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	It'd be so scary.
B:	I know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime
B:	and it doesn't seem like anything is working
A:	It really doesn't,
A:	it's kind of scary.
A:	I think that, uh, I think the laws have gotten so lenient, you know
A:	the court systems are too lenient.
A:	I think that's part of the problem.
B:	But, in, in, on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full.
B:	We can't, at least in this area, you know, they don't have any room to put anybody
B:	so a lot of people just get out, you know, back on the streets because there's no, they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they do that here, too.
A:	But I say, you know, they commit crimes let them be overcrowded, you know let them suffer a little bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know it,
B:	they have all sorts of, of rights, that, you know, are questionable.
B:	Maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so.
A:	I think if they knew it was going to be really horrible, wherever they were going, maybe they'd think twice about doing it.
B:	That's true,
B:	maybe the punishment should be more severe.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You know, the other thing that worries about it is, kids that are doing such bad crimes so young, you know, like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people.
B:	I know it.
A:	They,
A:	I don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything
A:	but that worries me,
A:	I wonder  what the next generation will be like.
B:	Yeah.
B:	exactly
B:	because they get involved in things so young that they don't really, realize what they're involved in.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, some people prey on that, you know,
B:	they'll take, uh, kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen. And, uh, get them involved in things because, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	well I don't know,
B:	I was watching on, a movie on T V,
B:	I don't know how true those can be,
B:	but you know, they, one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them, you know, you won't have a record because you're under eighteen.
B:	They'd steal cars and everything.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, I guess if they had, more of a deterrent, if they had more severe punishments it might be,
B:	but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think it would concern me even more if I had children, which I don't,
B:	but if I had children I wouldn't know where to raise them  to protect them.
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because it seems like now, even in the country, you hear about bad things happening.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's true,
B:	they, uh, and they, they talk about too, the gangs spreading, you know,
B:	like everybody thinks of them only in L A and New York
B:	but they spread out to cover more area
B:	and, I don't know, if, if gangs occur much down in Texas. Do they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think they have them in Dallas because I hear them talking about in the schools, different things happening,
A:	and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the same in some of the areas around here
B:	but I've never had any personal, you know, I never met anybody that I knew had anything to do with it. Or seen anybody,
A:	Me either
B:	but, uh, that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group.
B:	And, I think that a lot of people that sort of control them, control what they're doing are older, you know, business, you know, trying to control whatever. You know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	seemed like, like in the fifties when gangs were big
A:	it was just to be part of the gang
A:	but now they're so much into selling drugs  and weapons and all that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's pretty scary.
B:	It's true.
B:	And the weapons, my God, the weapons that people have are,
B:	some people are seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military.
B:	I don't know where they get them
A:	Really,
A:	yeah,
A:	those machine guns and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's scary.
A:	It's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore.
B:	That's the other thing, uh,
B:	is it's hard to even,
B:	I can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be.
B:	Especially if you're an inner city, you know, you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on.
B:	And, you're putting your life on your, on the line everyday.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Dallas, they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen
A:	but they keep losing them all the time
A:	and that, uh, you know,
A:	eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because  they won't let them hire any new ones
B:	I,
A:	and  they keep leaving.
B:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I just read an article yesterday, um, where this, what used to be a nice town in this area, they had a lot of budget cutbacks.
B:	Massachusetts is broke right now
B:	and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy
B:	and, they had to cut twenty guys from their forces
B:	and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well.
B:	And so, it's like
A:	Yeah
A:	, they figure, what a heyday, huh
B:	This is a depressing conversation though
A:	It really is
A:	Well, there's someone at the door
A:	so I guess I'll have to go see what my dog is barking about.
A:	But it was nice talking to you
B:	Okay,
B:	I hope things look up
A:	Well thanks
A:	same for you.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Where have you been on a wonderful vacation?
B:	Well normally when we go on vacation we go home, to Colorado.
A:	Oh, that's where we go home, too.
B:	Really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Colorado Springs is where we're from.
A:	That's where we go.
B:	How funny.
A:	Yes,
A:	my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.
B:	Really?
A:	Yes.
B:	We live up, up, uh, Lake, in the Broadmoor area
A:	Uh.
B:	that's where my my in-laws are.
A:	Oh, we've been there.
A:	We haven't skied at Broadmoor.
A:	We went there last year at Christmas time
A:	and it was twenty-seven below.
B:	Oh.
A:	So we had to cancel our ski lessons
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	as of you can't even ski there anymore.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they closed it down.
A:	Oh, just this year?
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Oh, my,
B:	they don't have enough money to keep it going,
A:	Uh.
B:	it doesn't, doesn't pay.
B:	So.
A:	So that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now if you were a skier.
B:	Well you know, well, now I don't know.
B:	Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's only a couple of hours away.
B:	And, uh, so, it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else.
B:	But, you can't, can't ski up there any more.
A:	No.
B:	Oh, I'd like to go on vacation.
B:	I my husband and I want to go to Florida to go to Disney World,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we have two little ones that are under two right now,
A:	Yes.
B:	so we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that,
A:	Oh.
B:	and,
A:	Well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the Premier Family Cruise Line
A:	and then we went to Disney.
A:	It was all part of the package.
B:	Oh.
A:	And on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck,
A:	and it was really oriented toward little kids.
B:	Well, how fun.
A:	So the kids could eat with Chip and Dale, you know,
A:	and, you know it was just a lot of fun.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	Oh, I bet.
A:	So then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas,
A:	and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney.
B:	Wow,
B:	well that sounds pretty, Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
A:	Yes,
A:	that was the way to travel.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything?
A:	Yes.
A:	That's right.
A:	That's right,
A:	and kids are really cheaper, too.
B:	Really.
A:	We really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,
A:	so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available.
A:	So we took whatever was available,
A:	and we left a day early,
A:	and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton,
A:	and the ship that was available, the only, uh, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites.
B:	Wow.
A:	So we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.
B:	Oh what a deal.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So then our cruise was actually extended a day,
A:	and our Disney was extended a day,
A:	so we turned a seven day trip into ten
B:	Great,
A:	and they paid for everything.
B:	Well, that's great.
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh.
A:	So that was a wonderful vacation.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I bet.
B:	That sounds like the way I'd want to do it I think.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado?
B:	Oh, well, we like to ski, of course,
B:	so we spend so much time with our families uh, and seeing our friends,
A:	Yes.
B:	because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do
A:	Yeah.
B:	so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation.
B:	We did, um, last year, though, go to San Antonio for Memorial Day which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing.
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard to do any, any kind of events that, uh don't, don't require as much,
A:	Right.
A:	That would be,
A:	Yes.
A:	I know,
A:	I think one of the places I always hit in Colorado, is that current outlet store.
B:	Yeah
A:	That's what,
B:	you should mention that,
B:	I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.
A:	Oh, with the Santa Claus on the cover.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	I've already ordered from that one,
A:	but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, do you live, where do you,
B:	what state are you in?
A:	Texas.
B:	Oh, you're in Texas.
A:	Yes,
A:	I'm in the Dallas area. In Plano.
B:	So am I.
B:	I'm in Garland.
A:	Uh so that's not too far.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so I guess they get people from all over.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,
A:	Well it was when we left last year.
A:	We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we pulled in just as it hit.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, how do you go?
A:	Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	oh,
B:	well, wait a minute,
B:	yeah,
B:	we do,
B:	we do.
A:	That's on like Route two eighty-seven or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I Twenty-five from there.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	we, uh, went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,
A:	because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.
A:	So, we went all interstate.
A:	We went up, um, through Oklahoma City and then up through, uh, Kansas, and then turned left and went in on I Seventy
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.
A:	It was a little more mile wise
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the,
B:	All set.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Actually I'm in Plano, too
A:	That's okay.
B:	I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere.
A:	That's okay,
A:	it's more, uh, concentrated, so they know where you are.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, anyway, I know here in, here in Plano some of the things that we do are, um, Kroger
A:	and some of the other stores, too, have said, If you bring your bags back to, to the store to recycle, then they'll pay you a certain amount of money,
A:	and that's one thing that started in the community.
B:	They actually pay you money for that?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, um, Brookshires up in uh, Allen, uh, you bring your bags back, you know, they, uh, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there,
B:	but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that. Um.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I know Kroger will do it,
A:	and I think Albertson's does it sometimes,
A:	I'm not sure.
A:	Um, and, and yet, I know that, uh, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, the, uh, community, like through the schools or things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Interesting.
A:	So, um, that's always helpful,
A:	and I know that we we have the, the can, the can, different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, one of the ways,
A:	I don't know, uh, if this would be helpful.
A:	It said on the, the computer, what do I think would be helpful.
A:	And I don't know if it would be helpful or not,
A:	but I know on Monday, the, the garbage men pick up like just, um, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have,
B:	Right.
A:	And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a, a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, like either glass or newspapers or whatever.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think they already do that out East.
B:	Um, they have to, it's a little bit more difficult, because people have to remember, Okay, today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic, and all that
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I think that's the way we need to go.
B:	It's, uh, it's pretty bad.
B:	All these years we've
B:	been, especially in this country, all the, uh, the plastic and the paper and everything, we just used to throw out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, you know, do that because I have to pick it up,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it just goes out with our trash,
A:	and I guess I'm not as, um, recycling minded as I should be
A:	but that goes out with the trash,
A:	and it really could be recycled.
B:	Yeah,
B:	about six months ago I started
A:	Did you?
B:	yeah,
B:	and, uh so what I do is, uh,
A:	Tell me.
B:	it's not bad,
B:	you just have to have a place to keep everything,
B:	but, uh, it, you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it.
B:	Just put your paper in the same place every day,
B:	and it'll start stacking up.
B:	Take your glass, um, you know, pickle jars, or, or whatever, uh, liquid jars, you know,
B:	just rinse them out a little bit
B:	and put them all in a place,
B:	and, uh plastics,
A:	Don't you have to take like labels off of those jars?
B:	No,
B:	from what I understand, uh, you can leave the labels on, um, although I rip, rip them off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't, I don't scrub them or anything,
B:	I just tear them off
A:	Take them off,
A:	yeah.
B:	throw the lids and everything out,
B:	but, uh, put all the glass in one place, and plastics, like milk jugs, uh, orange juice jugs, things like that.
A:	Soda,
A:	both liter sodas
B:	Yes
A:	can you do that.
B:	those also.
A:	Okay.
B:	Um, and then, of course, uh, cans, coke cans, whatever.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	But, uh, I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take, and all that,
B:	I've just read a lot about it,
B:	and I'm keeping these big piles of it right now
B:	I going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact.
B:	But, uh, you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up.
B:	There's a lot that we throw out.
A:	I, I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just, um, get it into different categories like that,
A:	and I, I don't know what it would take to, to get my children to start working on it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have two older ones that probably would go along with the, if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project, you know.
B:	It's, yeah, it's not a big deal.
B:	You get used to it.
B:	One,
B:	let me tell you one interesting thing
A:	Okay,
B:	when I went back to the store, and I said, Hey, um, I understand you all are taking these bags back, uh, you know, what do you do with them.
B:	And they told me, they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then, you know, go and recycle the rest.
B:	And I said, What do you mean the ones that don't belong there?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they said, Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles.
B:	And what I found out is, if you look at the bottom of those bags, Kroger or whatever the plastic ones, they've got numbers on them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and if it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number, like bags from Drug Emporium have a ...
A:	Hello.
B:	Hello.
A:	Hello,
B:	Hello,
A:	Hi.
A:	Boy
A:	it took forever to find somebody.
B:	Oh, well I'm glad you found me.
A:	Good,
A:	well I'm, my name's Gail,
A:	and I guess we have to, talk about credit cards.
B:	Yes.
B:	My name is Carolyn.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, if you're ready, then uh,
B:	Okay.
B:	I'll just let you start,
A:	Okay,
A:	I'll press one
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I'm not,
A:	this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me, because credit cards are my downfall.
A:	I just find it so easy to, to charge something when I don't have the money to pay for it,
A:	and I'm really trying to get out of that habit.
A:	So. I think they're kind of dangerous.
B:	I think they are, too.
B:	And, unfortunately, um, we use ours in, we don't use them all the time,
B:	but we use them like at Christmas time,
B:	and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me too.
B:	I think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them, um, that's what gets to be the really scary part, you know, if you think, when it comes around to income tax time, and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,
B:	you could really get a lot more stuff if you were just able to pay outright for it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true,
A:	that's true.
A:	Seems just like our society is so, um, pushes so hard for, you can have it, you know, and then no interest, no payments for a year, and stuff like this,
A:	they're really trying to get you into that situation, because they know they've really got you then,
A:	so.
B:	all I know is some of my credit cards,
B:	like, um, we have a Sears one,
B:	and we always get a maintenance agreement every year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's just easier to say, you know, just put that on my credit card.
B:	Well that's probably four or five hundred dollars, you know, that goes on at that point
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off.
A:	It's funny, that we've got a Sears card, and we bought a washer and dryer on it, four years ago, and we still owe.
A:	I mean, I, I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.
B:	Wow.
A:	It's just, uh, you know, you never, never get it out,
A:	and now that's real irritating.
B:	It sure is.
B:	We eventually did,
B:	one time we just borrowed, took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,
B:	and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was, you know, to just have that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We haven't done it lately.
B:	We probably need to do it again.
A:	Well, we did, you know,
A:	one time, we wanted to buy a truck, a used truck,
A:	and so we went down to the bank,
A:	and they said, Sure we'll give you a personal loan.
A:	It was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they said, sure that's no problem, but, you know, why don't we consolidate your bills,
A:	and at the time we thought, Oh, that would be great, you know, we could,
A:	and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them,
A:	you only have to write one check a month, not all those.
A:	You never miss one or whatever
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we did that,
A:	but we didn't realize at the time, until several months later, that we, we were real,
A:	I mean this was four three years ago,
A:	we were pretty young
A:	and we were just kind of like,
A:	well, I guess that means these credit cards are closed,
A:	and we didn't, you know,
A:	about six months later we realized we could use them,
A:	and so we charged them all up again.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before, but also adding the lower payment for all of them,
A:	So we were paying like twice.
A:	Um, so we didn't ever make that mistake again, luckily
A:	But, uh, we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing.
A:	We just,
A:	as a matter of fact, this, it's real interesting the subjects I get.
A:	They always seem to be so pertinent.
A:	But we just discussed this last night at church, talking about debt and things like that.
A:	It's so, so alluring, and uh, so easy to get,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, sometimes,
B:	I know,
B:	they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
B:	And, uh, if you could stick to that, you know, we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	Oh, I just picked up my daughter
A:	and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over.
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What a mess you are.
A:	Oh, so I don't know, if I, if I, I just feel kind of.
A:	My big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card,
A:	and I just thought, you know, if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something, you know and we had to, had to buy one, then we would really need that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so he said, Okay we'll keep it,
A:	and then we weren't smart enough to not use it,
A:	so.
B:	You know, one thing you might do with, in a situation like that, though, it's just like keep,
A:	Okay,
A:	so you're into microwave cooking.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know,
B:	and it's, uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
B:	and it be ready in just a few minutes
A:	, yes,
A:	and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,
A:	something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.
B:	All week.
B:	Well, we've done that, too.
B:	There's just my husband and I,
B:	and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot uh, pot of spaghetti
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,
B:	and I kind of get sick of it after he
A:	I know.
A:	I try not to make too much.
A:	It's just my husband and I, too
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,
B:	Right.
A:	but,
B:	Right.
A:	What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?
B:	Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
A:	Oh, oh.
B:	it's, it's really good,
B:	I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.
A:	Ooh,
A:	that sounds delicious.
B:	So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about you?
A:	I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it
A:	you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad
A:	and that's about it, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, what do you put in it?
A:	Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts
A:	and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh,
B:	that sounds good.
A:	and you mix it up,
A:	and you just put it on the top of the chicken,
A:	and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's delicious
B:	Ooh,
B:	that sounds good.
A:	and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business,
A:	and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's chicken's done.
B:	Is done,
B:	right.
A:	So that's a real easy thing for me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that sounds good, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,
B:	but
A:	No,
A:	I don't,
A:	my mom gets that,
A:	but,
B:	they have one,
B:	if you like to cook, they have,
B:	every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one
A:	Really.
B:	and, um, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,
B:	but, I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake,
B:	and it's just a regular cheese cake,
B:	and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon peel and orange peel
A:	Um.
B:	and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake,
B:	and it is wonderful,
B:	but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room temperature
A:	Um.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,
B:	but it's, it's very good.
A:	Well, I love cheese cake.
A:	I have never been, I don't know, the ones
A:	I have made I have not done that well with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like a baked cheese cake, you know,
A:	I don't,
A:	I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake.
B:	No
B:	it's not.
A:	And, uh, the recipes that I've used,
A:	everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple,
A:	and then I make it,
A:	and it's, it's really not very good
B:	Right.
A:	but yours sounds good.
A:	I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.
B:	It does,
B:	and it, it, it is really good.
A:	Um. Well, that sounds interesting,
A:	so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.
B:	Right
A:	Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?
B:	Oh, sometimes,
B:	but I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means.
A:	Me, either.
A:	I wish I knew more about it.
B:	I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, you know, and I learned a little bit about them then,
B:	but you know what would be fun, they have some of those classes you can take
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They would be, if you just had time to do it.
B:	yeah,
B:	and then there's places, um,
B:	do you live in Dallas
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	okay,
B:	there's places here that, um, offer,
B:	I think it's like once a month,
B:	you can go and, to a particular restaurant or whatever,
B:	and you can kind of take a cooking class
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you get to eat everything afterwards,
B:	and then they also go into the wines, you know to serve with, you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing,
A:	Well, how neat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.
B:	We have some friends who've done that,
B:	and they've really enjoyed it.
A:	Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.
A:	I guess I,
B:	Yeah,
B:	this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it sounds like, like it,
A:	Jay, um,
A:	my kids are, are both in college, um,
A:	and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.
A:	On the other hand, they really decided themselves.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?
B:	Well, I, uh,
B:	one girl went in, in state and has graduated,
B:	and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,
B:	and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,
B:	and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.
B:	Uh, so, that was pretty much, uh.
A:	Um.
A:	I see,
A:	well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,
A:	but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.
B:	Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,
B:	I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid to it, where you get that bachelor's.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if they can get, uh, um, two out of,
B:	let's see, my son got a full total scholarships
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,
B:	and so people should be advised to look for those,
B:	and, um,
A:	Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools
A:	or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
B:	Uh.
A:	and,
B:	Well, they, uh,
B:	I went, we went around,
B:	my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,
B:	and so there you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that was limited to five or six different places
B:	and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,
B:	and I guess I played a role in that.
B:	I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know,
B:	they'd all been, uh pretty efficient as far as studies
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,
B:	they just, uh they just knew they wanted to go to college,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We did do that,
B:	and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that's a great idea,
A:	I mean, that,
B:	Some people don't do it,
B:	and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,
B:	so if it's possible.
A:	Right.
A:	It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the compared to the, the total decision it's nothing.
B:	Right.
B:	I think in the short run it is expensive.
B:	In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable if the person,
A:	Yeah.
B:	my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,
B:	now she's coming home at the end of the semester
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.
B:	She started late.
B:	So that's, you know, strictly up to her,
B:	and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition
A:	Yeah.
B:	but again, that's her decision
A:	Right.
B:	so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,
B:	and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.
B:	So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.
B:	I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,
B:	but, uh, they have to do the work
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, back, back to this visiting thing,
A:	I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and, and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in reference to what we had seen.
B:	Oh, I think so.
B:	And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.
B:	They've just gotten so huge,
B:	and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,
B:	see that's just too many.
A:	Good grief
B:	Ended up going to where I used to go,
B:	and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,
B:	it's twenty-one thousand, now
B:	it's too big.
A:	Good grief.
B:	So,
A:	What is twenty-one thousand?
B:	Pardon?
A:	What school is that?
B:	It's Southwest Missouri State University
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,
B:	and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,
B:	and that's, that's not bad
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I teach in a school about eight thousand,
B:	and that's, that's even a little large
A:	Yes.
B:	but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.
B:	But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then, oh, those rating, uh,
B:	the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,
B:	I don't think it hurts to look at them
A:	Yes.
B:	I don't put that much stock in them,
B:	but
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	probably fine just to compare.
A:	Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.
B:	Right.
B:	If they, you know, uh, they need to,
A:	Okay,
A:	who do you like?
B:	Okay,
B:	What kind do I like?
B:	I like just about any kind except country and western.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's the same with me, same with me.
B:	It's, it's, course country
B:	and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like Clint Black, he's pretty good,
A:	and who's the other big guy?
B:	Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks
A:	Garth Brooks,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.
A:	Yeah,
A:	in fact I think both of them have performed here.
A:	And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know on the verge of country western.
B:	Right.
B:	Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know,
B:	his, his home town is about, uh, fifteen minutes away
A:	Oh, wonderful.
B:	so he is, he's a home boy
A:	Well, then, of course you like him.
A:	That's great.
A:	But, well, I have teen age children,
A:	and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's my personal favorite.
B:	My son is, uh, twenty-eight,
B:	so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh,
B:	he likes a little bit of every kind.
B:	He likes jazz and, uh, blues and, and course the rock
A:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.
A:	But I've got teenagers,
A:	so.
B:	Well, my teenagers are all gone.
B:	I can listen to any music I want to
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good,
A:	I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.
A:	It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies
A:	and, I just, I love that,
A:	that's probably my all-time favorite.
B:	You know, uh, I, I teach
A:	Um.
B:	and we can have music in the classroom,
B:	but it, you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that
A:	Right.
B:	and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and yet it's, it's, it stimulates them,
A:	Right.
A:	Relax,
B:	and and, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	What do you teach, what grade?
B:	Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve
A:	Good for you.
B:	and,
A:	A certain subject?
B:	Well, it's, uh, business technology.
A:	Good for you.
B:	But, uh
A:	I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, uh,
A:	I was reading
A:	my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college
B:	oh, boy,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's pretty good,
A:	it's just a real basic class,
A:	but we're learning a lot,
A:	and we have a home computer,
A:	so it's, it's very interesting.
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I'd learn it too.
B:	Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the subject of music
B:	I, uh,
B:	do you play any instruments?
A:	I play, I play piano,
A:	I took lessons for thirteen years,
A:	and right now my nine year old is taking piano,
A:	and I just got a whole mess of music,
A:	I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids.
B:	Ooh, you took on a,
B:	good job.
A:	I did it last year,
A:	and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,
A:	I don't want to work full time,
A:	so I just sub at the school,
A:	and that's kind of my volunteer thing,
A:	so that, it, it's really neat,
A:	and my older daughter plays the saxophone,
A:	my next son plays the drums,
A:	and my third son just started baritone this year,
A:	and my little girl will start French horn next year,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.
A:	Oh.
B:	So.
A:	French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.
A:	It's just my favorite.
A:	Of course that's what I played,
A:	and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and I get a little bit more time.
A:	Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.
B:	Yes,
B:	sounds like you've got a houseful.
A:	I do, I do, I love it,
A:	but we have a, a marvelous band instructor,
A:	and, and he's just, he's wonderful.
A:	We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,
A:	our junior high band is just wonderful.
B:	Oh, that's a,
A:	He, lot,
A:	and their concert band,
A:	and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,
A:	and my son will be in next year
A:	that's,
A:	I mean, they play college level music in junior high,
A:	he's that good of an instructor,
A:	and the kids just love him.
B:	Oh, that's wonderful,
A:	So it's really good.
A:	It is wonderful.
B:	I, I have totally, totally a tin ear
A:	Oh do you
B:	and I love music.
B:	I cannot carry a tune in a basket.
B:	I know what I like,
B:	but I
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and I, my kids, when I was little and, they were little
B:	and I was rocking them, singing to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater,
B:	Well, I, I try to be as well,
A:	Well, I'm not, uh, I,
A:	there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really,
A:	and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, uh, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	especially like good prime rib
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,
A:	and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York,
A:	and there are a lot of good restaurants around here.
B:	Oh, you're in New York,
B:	I was going to,
B:	there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it is absolutely wonderful.
A:	Really.
B:	And, uh, we were there a few months ago,
B:	and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,
B:	well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,
B:	but
A:	Oh, no,
A:	I'm in upstate New York,
A:	and it's actually very inexpensive,
A:	I,
A:	there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards,
B:	Oh, is it, okay.
B:	Wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,
B:	and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,
B:	but it is absolutely wonderful.
A:	Right.
B:	It's the best I have ever had.
A:	Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,
A:	so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas.
B:	Yeah
B:	Well,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	so, um, that's,
B:	I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,
A:	but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that they, uh,
A:	I go on,
A:	I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	but, I love that,
B:	fresh seafood down there,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great,
A:	you get the crabs
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself,
B:	Yeah
A:	so,
B:	Yeah,
B:	seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.
A:	That's true.
B:	But it sure is good,
B:	and it's supposed to be good for you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,
B:	Right.
A:	and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
B:	Right.
A:	so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you like spicy foods
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili
A:	and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and so, uh, it, people, they, you know,
A:	you go out to get the chicken wings
A:	and those are really hot and the hotter the better,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it
A:	Right.
A:	Sure.
B:	and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I like it hot,
B:	but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	My, generally my, my scalp will start,
A:	I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,
A:	but, uh, I don't know,
A:	but, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,
A:	I never been really fond of that stuff.
A:	You talk about spicy,
A:	that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,
A:	it's so hot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,
A:	well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances,
B:	Uh-huh
A:	So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too
B:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's one thing,
B:	and the price.  And the price. Make you want to come back.
A:	What's that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter,
B:	Go ahead.
A:	Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.
A:	I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the practice that is they,
A:	I, uh, I don't,
A:	you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.
A:	Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.
B:	Do you work for T I?
A:	No, uh,
B:	Oh.
A:	I'm in the Washington area.
A:	I work for N I S T .
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, all right.
B:	Well, see we have the testing already here.
B:	We've had it for, oh, about five years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It used to just be for new employees.
B:	And now  it's for all employees.
A:	And now,
B:	They, uh, randomly select employee numbers
B:	and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.
A:	Okay,
A:	and how do people feel about it?
B:	So, we're familiar with it.
B:	Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.
B:	But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things
B:	and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,
B:	and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.
A:	Well, okay,
A:	that's, that's a very different issue.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too
B:	so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate,
B:	there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,
B:	and I think some of those require the drug testing,
B:	but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in
B:	and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.
A:	And,
B:	I haven't personally ever been tested,
B:	but I don't have a problem with it.
A:	Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?
B:	No,
B:	but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.
B:	You know, it happens a lot of times
B:	like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever
B:	and, you know  then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.
A:	Well ,
B:	Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.
B:	It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name
B:	so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,
B:	and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.
A:	So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?
B:	Right.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
B:	When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.
B:	And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs
A:	but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,
A:	so,
B:	Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.
A:	The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff.
B:	They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines.
A:	So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.
B:	But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance  Well,
A:	Is Contact a,
B:	you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.
A:	Okay.
A:	Is Contact a,  substance?
B:	No.
B:	I'm,  just saying you probably put down on the sheet  anything you have taken.
A:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.
B:	I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person, but was a contract person,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I
B:	If you are a contract employee here  they test you too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh,
B:	just, he had some kind of flu or something.
B:	He got a real bad migraine
B:	and he took his mother's,
A:	All right.
A:	What is your favorite show?
B:	Well, I was just trying to think.
B:	When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.
B:	Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N
B:	and we took that,
B:	and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,
B:	and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.
B:	The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,
B:	like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.
A:	Sure.
B:	We have little ones.
B:	Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle things in situations.
A:	It really is.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What do you watch?
A:	I watch just about anything,  but not a lot of,  T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I usually watch, you know, the news
A:	and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's the same thing we do.
A:	and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I haven't gotten,  into many of those.
A:	Now, I do,  like,
A:	my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.
B:	I have heard that's real good.
A:	And I,  uh,
B:	That's,  Burt Reynolds, isn't it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've heard that.
A:	And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.
B:	Now someone told me that
B:	and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they said that that was really good this season.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, his favorite night is Monday night
A:	so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on Monday night,
B:	You've got to yeah,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because that and then that, uh, oh,
A:	I can't even think of the name of it.
A:	Like I say I'm not,
B:	DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .
B:	Huh, I don't even know.
A:	Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Now I,  we've never even seen that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and DESIGNING WOMEN.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we always, he watches that
A:	and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.
B:	On the others.
B:	Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.
B:	Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the
B:	The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.
A:	Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	That's the thing.
B:	And so,  we,
A:	Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they are.
B:	In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,
B:	but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.
A:	Did you get your pizza taken care of?
B:	Yeah,
B:	he has gone to get it.
B:	Thank you
B:	Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing
B:	and that's the day my husband,  wants to .
A:	Well, do you know,
A:	I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked
A:	and that's SISTERS.
A:	Have you watched that?
B:	No,
B:	but I saw that advertised today
B:	and it sounds like it's not fluff.
B:	It sounds like it's good.
A:	It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more drama to it.
A:	But it's a,
A:	So far it, I've watched it about three times now
A:	and it's really held my attention.
A:	It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good acting.
B:	Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker
B:	and you are wanting to cocoon more,
B:	that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
B:	Some of these,  that are nostalgic.
A:	Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,
B:	Did you,  like it?
A:	but I haven't,
A:	I did.
A:	I liked it.
B:	Did you?
B:	Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know
B:	and,
A:	Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.
B:	I haven't seen it either.
B:	I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's nearly,  too late for T V.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's the way I am.
A:	I get in,  from work
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm tired
A:	and I sit and watch for a few minutes
A:	so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's like,  we are kind of,   tuned out of our T V.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's us.
A:	If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we do too.
A:	But there are some good shows on.
A:	I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I like,
A:	I don't know
A:	I, I'm always in to making things
A:	and,  And I don't just spend all my time,
B:	I don't know,
B:	yeah.
B:	There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.
A:	and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.
B:	They don't have children yet,
B:	and they just turn it on when they walk in,
B:	they turn it off when they leave.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So they are used to that too.
A:	I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I understand.
B:	Same here.
A:	But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,
A:	and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's real good.
B:	And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,  you know, talk shows.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I like her.
A:	I never get in in time for any of those.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.
B:	I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,
B:	but it's nice talking with you.
A:	Well, it's nice talking with you.
B:	Thank you.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh, I guess it's, uh,
A:	watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime.
A:	In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around
A:	and well, I, I,
B:	Oh, gracious.
A:	they've caught them
A:	and they, they're in there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders?
B:	There was that, uh,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was really on the national news a lot.
B:	We heard a lot about that in Texas.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So that's,
A:	well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin
A:	so I kind of get both, both news
A:	and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her
B:	Oh.
A:	and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,
A:	so.
B:	Well, I can imagine.
A:	There .
B:	It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me.
B:	I, I don't know.
B:	I don't know if statistically they are
B:	but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news
B:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, that's hard to say for sure.
A:	I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity
A:	and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper
B:	You wonder about that sometimes.
A:	and they become big celebrities.
A:	But,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's kind of scary.
B:	I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories.
B:	Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.
A:	Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right?
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Do you have it up there?
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	I see.
A:	See I, I
B:	Do you think that's a deterrent?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it
A:	but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's,
A:	and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem,
B:	and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, they are really in a crisis.
B:	There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And a lot of them they put out on parole
B:	and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses
B:	and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes
A:	than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people
A:	and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.
B:	I think that could be true too.
A:	Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh,
B:	I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again
A:	Yeah.
B:	And to me that's really scary.
B:	Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer.
A:	If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They think it's okay thing to do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's a very good point.
B:	You know, I,
B:	there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing.
B:	Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore.
B:	And,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor,
A:	well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they have a lot less crime.
B:	Huh.
A:	Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe.
A:	Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that,
B:	Well, Sid,
B:	have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle?
A:	Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements.
A:	Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal.
A:	Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess.
B:	Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often.
B:	And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm, I'm real picky.
B:	if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know,
A:	even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it.
A:	Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand
A:	and it's still in pretty good shape.
A:	Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke,
A:	and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that
A:	but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen.
A:	But I still think I I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then.
A:	Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA
A:	But, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I, I baby them as much as I possibly can.
A:	Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays.
A:	Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh,
A:	so I don't have to buy one too often.
B:	That's true.
B:	Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet?
B:	Uh, do you have a family fleet
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me
A:	so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits,
A:	but it just doesn't seem to want to.
A:	I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die.
B:	Well, that may be.
B:	They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then
B:	like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine.
A:	Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler
A:	but it runs good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager.
B:	It's only a, a couple of years old.
B:	But that's the second one of, of those that we've had,
B:	and that's the, the family travel vehicle.
B:	You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week,
B:	but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.
B:	I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot.
B:	Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle  that's in front of me.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle.
A:	Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times
A:	and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around.
A:	I just feel that,
A:	So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile?
B:	Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY.
B:	Have you seen that yet?
A:	No,
A:	I, I saw the previews.
B:	It's really good.
B:	I loved it.
B:	Um, it's, um.
A:	Does, does he, does it have a happy ending,
A:	or.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really good ending
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B:	I generally don't get into movies that much,
B:	but I saw that one,
B:	and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF.
A:	Oh, that was funny, wasn't it
B:	Yeah,
B:	did you, have you seen that one?
A:	Yes,
A:	and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it
A:	Yes.
B:	But it was silly.
A:	Right.
A:	So, now these are for two very different movies.
A:	One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.
A:	Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.
A:	I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's been out for a couple of years,
A:	but. Have you seen that?
B:	I haven't seen that yet.
A:	Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play,
A:	and it's beautifully done.
A:	Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit
A:	and there might be a word or two changed.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie
B:	Um. Such as
A:	um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies,
A:	and I also like just some strange movies.
A:	Do you have any.
A:	Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER.
A:	Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS.
A:	That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	I haven't seen any of those.
A:	Oh.
A:	Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend,
B:	They're really good?
A:	I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing,
A:	you have to like,
A:	did you see TWIN PEAKS?
B:	Huh-uh,
B:	no.
A:	No,
A:	so, okay.
A:	So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're, they're just strange.
B:	Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense
A:	Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word.
B:	or,
A:	Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric
A:	and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.
B:	Oh really.
A:	That was the television show.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies.
A:	Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY.
A:	Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um,
A:	what, what are the titles,
A:	I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters.
A:	Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal.
B:	Right.
B:	So do you like, um, movies a lot?
B:	See I don't do,
B:	I don't.
A:	I do, I do like movies a lot.
B:	Right.
B:	See, I don't do that,
B:	I don't go to movies that often,
B:	but, just recently I've been to a couple
A:	Do, do you rent them,
A:	or.
B:	Um, no,
B:	we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally,
A:	Yes.
B:	but, I don't know,
B:	I just, I usually fall asleep
B:	or I get bored pretty easily
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what my wife does too, um,
A:	I mean, she falls asleep
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	that's exactly right.
A:	Well, well it was good talking to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's good to talk to you, too.
A:	Take care.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	did they tell you our topic?
B:	Uh, no,
B:	somebody else answered the phone and put my number in.
A:	Okay,
A:	it's, uh,
B:	Uh, what is the topic?
A:	The topic is cars.
A:	What kind of car will you buy next
A:	and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac.
A:	Okay.
B:	I've had, uh,
B:	well, I'm on my third one.
B:	And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm the same way.
A:	I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs.
A:	I went to my first Lincoln this last time.
A:	I travel
A:	and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company
A:	so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I finally tried one after fifty years
B:	My,
A:	and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars,
A:	but I bought a Lincoln
A:	and I like it.
B:	My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years,
B:	but I've always been a G M man.
B:	I'm in the auto parts business myself.
A:	Oh, are you?
B:	And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I just love it to death.
B:	I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it.
A:	Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman.
A:	I travel on the road
A:	so I like a little heavier car
A:	but,
B:	I used to do that quite a bit myself.
A:	So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I tell you what,
A:	I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	because I like the Lincoln
A:	but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better.
B:	They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better.
A:	I think so, too.
B:	And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products
B:	and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash
B:	and, and the, the buttons are so small to push
A:	Yeah,
A:	they really do.
B:	and G M doesn't seem to do that.
B:	I kind of like that feature,
B:	so.
A:	You know, I'm a funny duck
A:	that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.
A:	I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.
A:	They always appear to hold well.
B:	I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.
A:	Did you.
B:	And I had them do all four wheels.
A:	And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is,
A:	a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car
A:	and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln
A:	and they're just not as large as before.
A:	I do miss that.
B:	That's true,
B:	yeah.
B:	But, what is big today.
A:	Well, you're right.
B:	You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's big,
A:	but the trunk space for me, uh,
A:	what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car
A:	and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.
B:	You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now, I have the Town Car
A:	and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac.
B:	Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh,
B:	or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	You know, straight across.
B:	I mean,
A:	They went all the way down?
B:	Front to back.
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	Not going from side to side.
A:	That's good.
B:	And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items,
A:	I sell guns, gun cases and things like that
B:	I see.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I need to, you know,
A:	that's about the same size as a golf club.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that
A:	and,
B:	I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.
A:	Nope.
B:	Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car
A:	Right.
B:	because it's a V Six,
B:	but it, uh,
B:	I I drove it from here to Memphis
B:	and I really enjoyed driving that car.
B:	If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville.
A:	I usually fly.
A:	I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me.
A:	We drove it ten hours to Nashville,
A:	and it, it handled real well,
A:	but, my main thing is space,
A:	so if a Continental,
A:	I might consider it the next time,
A:	a Continental has more trunk space.
B:	You might take a look at them.
B:	They, they had a, a lot more trunk space.
B:	As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had.
A:	You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?
B:	Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like leather interiors also.
B:	Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather
B:	and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it
B:	and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.
A:	That's a nice car.
A:	You bet,
A:	and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus,
A:	Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.
B:	Is it?
B:	I'd have to agree with that.
B:	They are my favorite team, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	A little disappointing the last few years.
A:	I'm telling you.
A:	You think they'll sign Ruben?
B:	You know I really don't.
A:	No?
B:	I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra
B:	and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players.
B:	Oh, I do, too.
B:	I just,
A:	I think that's going to be the big problem.
B:	The main thing,
B:	It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	We just can't seem to, you know,
B:	I think we've been in this spot,
B:	I think we finished second once or maybe even twice.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, it's just too disappointing.
B:	I just watch them fall every year.
A:	Right.
B:	I was a Pete Incaviglia fan
B:	and, uh I liked him,
A:	Oh.
B:	but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,
B:	decisions like that have to be made by someone
B:	Glad it's not me making them.
A:	Right
A:	I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.
A:	But,
B:	They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, and that's the name of the game, too.
B:	You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money,
A:	Right.
B:	now, it's just it's frightening.
A:	Right.
B:	You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.
A:	That's true.
A:	But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need.
A:	Because they've got the hitting,
A:	but they need the pitching.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they really do.
A:	Um.
B:	I think they, uh, I think they need them all.
B:	I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities
B:	and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store,
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	but, I realize the difference,
B:	but, I just don't understand,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	I tell you.
A:	It's real aggravating,
A:	but,
B:	But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them
B:	because I tell you, we need a winner in this town.
B:	It looks like our Cowboys are coming back
B:	but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas,
A:	That's right.
B:	but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team.
A:	It's always got,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area,
A:	but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	It's,
A:	Just real aggravating to
A:	because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here,
A:	so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,
A:	so it's a lot of losers
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.
B:	I've been one,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four
B:	and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time
B:	and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean I follow them
B:	and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys,
B:	but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.
B:	I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium.
A:	Right.
A:	I'm telling you.
B:	I love Nolan Ryan.
B:	I guess you probably love him, too.
A:	Right,
A:	I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.
B:	Oh, I do, too.
A:	I mean, It would be packed.
A:	And they got that new stadium they are building.
A:	So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that,
B:	It will.
A:	but,
B:	Well, where do you think they are heading this year?
A:	Uh, it's hard to say.
A:	It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra
A:	and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer,
B:	Right
A:	and, man, that's getting old, you know.
A:	These guys have been pampered.
A:	I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever
A:	And,
B:	and they have the later ten game winning streak
A:	Right.
B:	and they give him all kinds of money
B:	and then he just goes right down the tubes.
A:	And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old.
A:	But I like this Sandy Johnson.
A:	Hello.
B:	Yes,
B:	I forgot we had to hit one
B:	Our time will be up.
A:	Well, I hit one and nothing happened.
A:	What's going on?
B:	Well, just go ahead and talk,
B:	that's all.
A:	Are you sure?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Don't they usually tell you to say something?
B:	I don't think so.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.
B:	Yes,
B:	I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden.
A:	What do I do?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally.
B:	Good.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	you're ahead of me.
A:	Is, uh, is that good?
A:	Okay.
B:	That's better.
A:	And I edge it occasionally.
B:	Oh, that's really good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see, am I good, or what?
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do
B:	I don't do any of that.
B:	Really,
B:	well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, he is going to build you a fence.
B:	Well, he's giving me an estimate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it.
A:	What, for a fence?
A:	Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one?
B:	he is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that.
B:	What does he charge me?
A:	Well, my,
A:	I don't know.
B:	It's like next to nothing.
B:	it's ten because I,
B:	it's forty a month.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds.
B:	Well, he won't pull weeds.
B:	He says he'll spray them,
B:	but he won't pull them.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
B:	But he just says to keep spraying them so,
A:	Well so,
B:	Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me
B:	so that was real,
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately?
B:	No.
B:	No.
B:	There are two out front
B:	I thought I'd grab one of these days,
B:	but I haven't bothered as I walk on by.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds
B:	and there was dog dirt in it
A:	Oh, oh, goody.
B:	and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
B:	and I left the whole thing
B:	and  that was about a month ago.
A:	I thought you were going to say there  I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds
B:	I would rather a snake,
B:	no
A:	Oh, God, oh
B:	I just left the whole thing.
B:	The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't gone back over there.
B:	It really made me mad.
A:	Oh, God.
B:	So anyway but,
A:	But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted?
A:	Did they die or what?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	now they died.
A:	Oh, they're all,
A:	so they, oh,
A:	are they going to come back in the spring?
B:	I don't know.
A:	Oh.
B:	I don't know,
B:	and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,
B:	then they started to die, too.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, I don't think any of it comes back
B:	but I don't know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	maybe these,
B:	sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.
A:	I don't know, uh,
B:	So,
A:	Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	They're the best kind.
A:	Yeah
A:	they, They're really pretty.
B:	They, they're like indestructible.
B:	They really grow nice
B:	and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,
B:	but lots of times they do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah
B:	We'll see.
B:	They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes?
B:	But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.
A:	We didn't disconnect, did we
B:	I hope not
B:	Neither one of us is getting paid for this.
A:	Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid
B:	Yeah,
B:	really,
B:	I know it.
B:	I can't believe this.
B:	I got somebody from Utah and somebody,
A:	What?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	where was the person last night was from far away.
A:	You're kidding?
A:	Really?
B:	And we get each other down the street.
B:	This is so funny.
A:	Well, the, uh,
A:	I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas
A:	and that was it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had Dallas, Arlington.
B:	I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose  son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow.
A:	Really?
B:	I can't remember,
B:	but she told me about the Utah Jazz,
B:	we talked about basketball.
A:	Oh, really
B:	And I don't remember what, what the place was last night,
B:	but I'm thinking Colorado,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I'm not sure
B:	I'd know the place, anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	I don't know,
B:	But mostly they're from the area.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It,
A:	Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.
B:	Not for me.
A:	Not for me either.
B:	You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds.
A:	What do I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I don't, you know,
A:	I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it
A:	and that's about it.
B:	I know.
A:	What do I do with it?
B:	I know,
B:	we're not typical Texans.
A:	No.
A:	What's going on,
A:	are they going to tell us to stop or what
B:	I don't know,
B:	I hope so.
B:	Come on,
B:	come on.
A:	Isn't it five minutes?
B:	I don't know.
A:	I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens.
B:	I know.
B:	Well, we can talk about something else.
B:	It's just a suggested topic.
A:	Oh, oh, it's just suggested?
B:	So, how's the baby, do you think
A:	What?
B:	How's the,
A:	We could talk, Let's talk about the baby.
B:	Let's talk about the baby.
A:	Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?
B:	Yeah,
B:	our budgeting plan includes me getting a job
B:	We're, we're at the point now,
B:	I I quit working about six months ago to start this house
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm out of cash
B:	and I'm not out of project yet.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.
B:	As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate.
B:	Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.
B:	So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.
B:	But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,
B:	we always put ten percent back,
B:	and that's a never touch.
A:	Uh, into savings.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Either savings or investment, one of the two,
B:	but we don't ever put it in a high risk.
B:	It's just always going to be there.
A:	Well, that's pretty good.
B:	And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,
B:	we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food
A:	Boy, that's pretty good.
B:	and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.
B:	And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate.
B:	I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that,
A:	Sure.
B:	but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.
B:	It's just, when you,
B:	see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home  and do it yourself.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's tough here too.
A:	You have to have the contractor sign with you.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it
B:	Yeah.
A:	, where I live, that is.
B:	And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the bank can eat the contractor.
A:	Oh, bad for him, huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	bad for him.
B:	But, the homeowner can't be touched.
A:	Um.
B:	It's a homestead state.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	see right now if I quit paying any of my bills,
B:	the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.
B:	They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.
A:	Wow.
B:	You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything
B:	that's not the tools of your trade,
B:	but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.
A:	Well, that's kind of handy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pretty interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Texas has quite the history.
B:	Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know
B:	We just going to spend it all.
A:	That's kind of what we do.
A:	We, uh, we're L D S
A:	and so we pay ten percent tithing
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, and my wife doesn't work.
A:	We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.
B:	You know, uh, we paid cash for car.
B:	Well, we bought the car on time, one of them,
B:	but we, you know, we since paid it off.
A:	Well that's pretty.
B:	The land is paid for cash,
B:	so we don't have to worry about that.
A:	That's a great position to be in.
B:	Well, it's fraught with other problems
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not very motivated
A:	Oh
A:	What kind of consulting do you do?
B:	Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm into computers, too.
A:	I I'm a E D P auditor.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh.
A:	And.
B:	You into mainframes?
A:	and P C s.
B:	oh really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus.
B:	Are you really?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	I just got that a few days ago.
A:	Three oh?
B:	Oh, gees,
B:	don't get me to lying.
B:	I bought it at a fire sale.
A:	Oh.
B:	This guy's place burned down,
A:	but the,
A:	some people object to that which I don't mind, no problem at all, you know.
B:	Oh, I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it
B:	and,  I'm former military
A:	Huh.
B:	so you get kind of used to,  to going through stuff like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	You know, you don't pay any attention to it. I mean,
A:	Right.
B:	once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam,  , you know, you just kind of,  kind of blow it off
A:	I know.
B:	but
A:	I know, yeah.
A:	I served my time too, yeah.
B:	So, I think, I think the people who have, who have been down that route or have had it, to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things.
B:	You just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I do know that there are several sites .
B:	I didn't,
B:	I wasn't aware that Austin was one of them,
B:	but I think Johnson City was one.
A:	Oh, did they object too?
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's, there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue. And the, but also on things that I'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people, uh, there were, the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I'm, I'm all for it.
A:	I,
A:	uh, it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, uh,  uh, of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it.
A:	Uh, uh, and I think it is, they, they found that it's been very low really.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess maybe at the locations though, I don't know if they have it done but, done it by location.
A:	I don't really know if, uh, they need to publish that really.
B:	Oh, I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis.
A:	Right.
B:	I mean,  if they're going to do it, just deal with it and,  be done with it.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	But I think that was an actually a good thing that happened, uh, I never considered it, I guess, it's an invasion of your privacy
A:	but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to,  have everyone, uh, take the test right away
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, uh, I might as well get off, you know, if I want to stay so, you know,  if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.
B:	Oh, I,  Oh, I think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for the, their co-workers, you know,  it's like, you know, my father was a fireman
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	and I can just imagine if, you know, you know, some guy being on drugs they go there
B:	and,  and, you know, you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you
A:	Right.
B:	and they fall, they fall out because of the drug issue,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the use of drugs or anything like that,  will, uh, be a problem.
A:	Right.
A:	this is, this is a tough one, I don't, really haven't thought about any of this.
A:	They had gardening yesterday and all the repairs,
A:	and, boy, I could,
A:	Okay,
A:	what did you buy?
B:	A Ford Explorer.
A:	I'm sorry, what?
B:	A Ford Explorer.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	one of the new ones.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, um, I'd, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle I've owned.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I would probably purchase another one, um, I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from
B:	but as far as, uh, the quality seems to be there, um, it's quiet, it's, it handles well, um,
B:	but I believe I'd get that or a Porsche, one of the two.
A:	Oh really?
B:	No,
B:	not
A:	Um, if I had the money, I think I would love to own a, a B M W.
B:	And why would that be?
A:	I don't know, I,
A:	from what, or
A:	either that or Mercedes, just because they're put together so well.
A:	It seems like they last forever.
B:	What's wrong with the Volvo.
A:	Oh, I don't know, they're, they're not as nice looking.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh,
A:	to me, I don't know, I'm sure there are some that are,
A:	but everyone I've seen is kind of plain,
A:	but.
B:	What, what city are you calling from?
A:	Sherman.
B:	Oh.
A:	Where are you?
B:	Up in Dallas.
A:	Dallas.
B:	Um.
A:	Yeah.
B:	B M W or Mercedes, yeah,
B:	well that's a, that's a,
A:	If I had, um, had the money, I mean that's just,
A:	I know I never would own one,
A:	but, uh, I don't know. I like,
A:	my actual favorite cars were, uh, like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty-five.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really like that body style,
A:	but I don't own one of those either
B:	What do you presently drive?
A:	Uh, Mercury Topaz.
B:	Um, fun.
A:	Cheap taste, cheap taste in cars, okay
B:	Well there nothing wrong with those, uh. They're, they're nice they're nice vehicles, nothing wrong with those.
A:	Yeah,
B:	It, um, it's just everybody has their own taste,
B:	but man the Mercedes are expensive.
B:	My wife has a Volvo
B:	and it, it's nice, I mean, you know, it's okay an.
A:	Sorry I roped on Volvos then
B:	Huh?
A:	Sorry I roped on Volvos then.
B:	Oh no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no
B:	it,
B:	it,
B:	I, I kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the G L rather than the D L
A:	Oh, is it?
A:	See I don't much about them I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there just safe to just,
B:	that's the reason why we mainly got it.
B:	We got white
B:	and it's the safest four door, you know, it's good for, if you have a family, which we do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We just, we just
B:	one out
B:	and so it's, it's, uh, um, you know,
B:	they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer.
B:	You know, I presently,
B:	I used to have a two, eighty Z,
B:	and I'm a tall guy an,
B:	and, uh, they're hard to get around in traffic to see.
A:	Really.
B:	Because you can't see a car ahead of you,
B:	but they're fast as lightning and all that crap.
B:	But the Explorer, I mean, you're sitting up on top of everything
B:	and you can really see real well.
B:	And I just,
B:	it's so comfortable So, you're,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	what are your feelings about American versus European cars?
A:	Um, I like anything besides Japanese.
A:	Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore.
A:	I don't like Japanese cars,
B:	Why not.
A:	But, uh, European, I don't have any, I mean,
A:	those are the kind I usually end up liking the most.
A:	American cars, a lot of people say they, they don't last long
A:	but I've never had any problem with, um, my Mercury,
A:	or,
A:	my
A:	my husband has a, uh, Cougar
A:	and he's never had any problem with it either,
A:	so, I don't know.
B:	That's the way it goes, I guess.
A:	Well what are your,
A:	I guess this is your first time to buy American,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I was real hesitant
B:	but it was
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know, uh, I mean, I think European cars are great, course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff
B:	and they're
B:	some, some of them are easy to work on.
B:	A Volvo, being a four cylinder is very easy to work on.
A:	Really.
B:	Uh, excellent warranty, I mean, just, unbelievable warranty.
B:	And, and, uh, of course, Ford isn't too bad.
B:	I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle,
B:	uh, but all of it has to do, in my opinion with the service. and the attitude of the service, of the dealership.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford.
A:	Where?
B:	There's,
B:	Middlekauff Ford in Plano.
A:	Okay.
B:	Their just,
B:	their attitude is just slimy.
B:	And, and, uh, I've written a, a letter to Middlekauff
B:	and I've told them that, matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division, their still concerned about my attitude *spelling "their" should be "they're
B:	and it, it will never change about that place.
B:	And, uh,
B:	but, uh, anyway that's my own personal comment I guess,
B:	but.
A:	Yeah,
A:	this girl that works for me just bought a car down there
A:	and
A:	they, they had a problem with they, uh, took their Camaro in to get it traded and they, they hadn't signed any papers
A:	and they had all ready, uh, taken it in to paint it and everything
A:	and everything was stolen out of it
A:	and the people, um, wouldn't reimburse them for anything.
B:	Middlekauff wouldn't?
B:	She needs to find herself a lawyer.
B:	She'd, she'd come out like a champ on that one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, I've heard some stuff about them.
A:	But, um.
B:	So have you been using, well anyway.
A:	What.
B:	That was,
B:	I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing,
B:	but that's,
A:	Oh.
B:	they, they don't want to hear that.
A:	Oh, just about a week.
B:	Is that all?
B:	A week.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Good Lord,
B:	I think I started in January or February.
A:	Really.
B:	Oh God, I've,
B:	I'm like twenty some phone calls.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	That's why I, I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what.
B:	Well look, I've enjoyed speaking with you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you too.
B:	And keep smiling.
A:	Okay,
A:	thanks.
B:	Bye, bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	So, child care, your views.
B:	Uh, well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way
B:	and right now I'm, I'm all with her during the day.
B:	I,
B:	if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find, if I was close to home, relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as, as parents.
A:	And what religious faith?
B:	Uh, Latter Day Saints.
A:	Oh that's, that's good.
B:	So so that's what I would try to do.
B:	With a teaching background I've, um, had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations
B:	but I've seen some good ones
B:	and I've seen some really bad ones.
A:	Uh, they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	And,  whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good.
B:	and so,
B:	Right.
B:	By trying to get them to conform to concern standards they, uh, kind of, uh, eliminate a lot of the, uh,
A:	Better situations.
B:	Yeah.
B:	The, the, uh,
B:	what am I trying to think of that, not the imagination but the creativity in, in the situation
B:	and so,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	that's, that's very well phrased.
A:	Uh, so, have you ever used outside child care?
B:	No,
B:	I haven't.
B:	We've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two
B:	but I've never had, um,
A:	Real day care.
B:	Right.
B:	She's, she's not even a year yet,
B:	so,  we haven't been in, you know, a lot of need yet.
A:	Uh
A:	our step daughter's ten now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma.
A:	But, quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the Pass of Woodland Park there was, uh, ex-school teacher that, uh, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers in her home
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they would read and play,
B:	Have a relative a structured,  activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own.
A:	seem to be,
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	and, uh, despite our beliefs, she was, uh, one of the more, uh, Charismatic Christian faiths
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it worked out wonderfully.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know that, uh, that I guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that, uh, I don't know if the resources are the proper term, you know, just the, the know, knowledge of who's a available, then you could probably find some really good care.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	but I don't know that it would be state approved.
B:	That's true.
B:	You can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit
B:	but actual, you know, that's sometimes different, done on a different scale.
B:	I have even considered, you know, baby-sitting myself, I have a teaching degree, and, uh, thought well, you know, I could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to,
B:	but I think if you take more than three children in, well,
B:	that was how it was this Virginia, we've recently moved here to Texas, but in Virginia I think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed.
A:	I,
A:	now I don't know what the current Texas laws are
A:	but I, but I do know that the license doesn't seem to, uh, guarantee quality.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel, file for it just like a business.
B:	You may not have to prove any type of qualification for it I don't,
A:	Uh, now here I believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, uh, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness, and levels of supervision levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's, uh, kind of a minimum there that you're getting.
B:	Your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children, you know, like the educational activities, the supervised play and so forth.
A:	uh, my wife is, uh, agnostic
A:	and I'm, uh, a backsliding Presbyterian
B:	I like that term
A:	and, uh, get, I really believe that this Charismatic care, or the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi Charismatic I might say was quite good.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was a good influence for your daughter, uh.
A:	Yes,
A:	very
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	and, and, uh, the care is what I guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a little bit of love and, and attention is what most of them need.
B:	You know, even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program
B:	and, and,
A:	And not have any care.
B:	Right.
B:	And, and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself
B:	and so,
A:	And I'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se.
A:	Do you know had a I'm saying?
B:	Well, even educated play, uh, supervised play, can teach without,
B:	and I'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or, or, or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills
B:	and, uh, uh, you know, like my, my child that,
B:	she want be an only child for long,
B:	but, you know, she was an only child,
B:	or maybe your daughter,  not having,
A:	Proper interface.
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	just,
A:	It's just, just correctness of, of social skills, if you will.
B:	Right,
B:	those basic things that, uh, they would, that, you know, you would be a little bit of, uh, I don't know if manners is a good term or not but,  you know, dealing with other through proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth, you know, that sort of thing, you'd want your child to learn that, from the experience of someone else, certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this, do that, you know, you'd want them it promote politeness and niceness, you know, the things that you would want any child to learn
B:	and,  the reason,
B:	that's done through example, you know, not an actual sit down learn situation
B:	so,
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	uh, it's a very broad issue.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it is
A:	And, you know, it's a shame
A:	but most people doing, child care earn almost no money.
A:	They operate at, you know,
A:	the owner of the of a, you know, a large child care facility now,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we're not talking somebody that does six kids,  in their home or three or whatever.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it.
B:	You mean somebody that has an actual establishment.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Their employees earn almost nothing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know I, I did that for summer
B:	so I can, I can vouch for that
A:	And that's really, really a shame too because,
A:	do you and your husband both work.
B:	No,
B:	just he does I'm, I'm here during the day with her.
A:	Well, that's wonderful if, if you can make it that way.
B:	Well, we, we decided to,
B:	we live on a lesser budget so that we have
B:	that, that's more important to us, you know, as, as, uh, there may come a time when I will be working again, you know,
B:	but right now that's what we've chosen
B:	and we wanted to have several,
B:	we got her
B:	and we've got another on the way,  and maybe another, one soon after that,
A:	Well,  like I said, that's grand if, if you can pull it off
B:	so
B:	Right.
A:	but more and more we're being forced into a situation, we as Americans are being forced into a situation, where you've got to have,
A:	Well, I'm talking to you from Dallas.
A:	What part of the country are you in?
B:	Oh, boy, this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano
A:	Well, we can, uh, complain together or swear we can complain together about the humidity
B:	Exactly.
B:	I guess the weather hasn't been too different between us.
A:	No,
A:	I don't think so,
A:	I wouldn't think,
A:	yeah.
A:	I,
B:	what part of Dallas are you from?
A:	Far north Dallas
B:	Oh, north Dallas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	about a half a mile from Plano
B:	Well, jeez.
A:	So we're in the,
B:	Well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's been very, very rainy, I know.
A:	Oh
B:	How about that.
B:	How does it compare to the years past?
A:	um, I don't know, I haven't lived here, let's see, we lived out of state in Wisconsin
A:	and we just
A:	we lived here ten years ago,
A:	and when we first lived here, we we were in Garland, East Richardson, and, um, doesn't seem like it was quite as humid.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, I don't know, then we went, we lived in, uh, Madison, Wisconsin for five years, um, for my husband's schooling, graduate schooling,
A:	and it just,
A:	it's a lot cleaner up there,
A:	but, um, it's a lot colder too.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, what brought you guys down to Texas then?
A:	Uh, his job, he came back to start work again for a different company,
A:	so, said,   Here, here's a
B:	How about that.
A:	here we are again.
B:	That's great.
A:	It just seems a little more humid than it,
A:	I don't ever remember, of course, you know, you only remember the good stuff,
A:	but, um, I just don't remember the humidity.
B:	Right.
B:	Well  definitely, I'm sure, the winters are more mild here.
A:	This much rain, and this much humidity.
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	they are.
A:	Actually, though, it was a lot rainier here in the winter, uh, we came back last August.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's just a lot rainier than I remember it, all through the seasons, you know.
B:	Sure.
A:	Um,
B:	It seems that progressive,
B:	I've, been down here five years, just over five years now, that, every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted.
A:	I really do think that's part of it.
B:	Huh.
A:	Um, uh, in, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, when they get winters it's, um, the winters are bad, but not what you hear about.
A:	It's just like down here, when you hear, when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here.
B:	A hundred and sixty.
A:	I'm making that up.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	You know, when it's only like ninety-five.
B:	Sure.
A:	Um, it's just like up there, when you hear it's forty below, it's probably really only five below.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, and it's so dry, that it's, it's like going to
A:	well, probably what Arizona used to be like, you know, it's just dry and cool,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it's not, it's not what you think it is.
B:	True.
A:	Um, no,
A:	there have been times, though, when it gets so frigid that you you can't stand it.
A:	Where did you move here from?
B:	Colorado.
A:	Well, there,
A:	you could talk about that, that's,  that's a strange state for,
B:	Oh sure, I, I'm uh,  I'm very familiar,
B:	my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin.
A:	Oh, there you go, okay.
B:	So, I'm, uh, quite familiar with how it is up there,
B:	and if you,
B:	kind of interesting, uh, the people down here typically don't think it gets above, you know, fifty degrees
A:	This is very true.
B:	And it's always snow, you know,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	well actually, the summers up there, we thought, were the most beautiful time of the year.
B:	Oh yes.
A:	Um, in terms of Colorado, I know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff I don't like, um,
A:	but I'd,
A:	used to go on,
A:	I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin
A:	and I did a lot of business in, uh, um, well, Denver,
A:	and that's, that's probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions, and then you go into the mountains
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's snowy
A:	and uh, it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado.
B:	Oh sure.
B:	My parents just live, uh, thirty miles south of Denver
B:	and it can be sunny and, and no problem in Denver
B:	and they'll be having snow
A:	Isn't that strange?
B:	So it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a short distance
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then things like
A:	are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or I don't,
B:	Uh, it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It used to be no problem, just because it was such a, a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere,
B:	but now,  as they start to clear more things out.
A:	The mountains,
A:	yeah.
A:	Even, I mean,
A:	I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
A:	and I can tell you that, um, they've even had,
A:	in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, they've even had, I'm going to say, mini tornadoes for lack of a better word.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside.
A:	That was unheard of, you know, twenty years ago.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, so I don't know what's happening, if it's, you know, we are, the greenhouse, I don't really know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me neither.
A:	It's just, you know. It's definitely not as, um,
B:	But,
A:	I know I associate the pollution with weather in general,
A:	so I guess one thing we do miss, is that's a smaller town,
A:	and it it was,
A:	it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere, you know.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure.
B:	Well, it's been good talking to you.
A:	You too.
B:	Good-bye
A:	Okay.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?
B:	Well, uh, I have two children,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.
B:	One of the things that I have made time for is, uh, playing softball.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really enjoy,
B:	I enjoy softball,
B:	but I enjoy all kind of sports.
B:	I enjoy watching and participating.
B:	I really like water sports like swimming and skiing,
B:	but I do not get to do that too often.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then I, I really enjoy sewing,
B:	but I do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing.
B:	How about you?
A:	Oh, I, uh, like sports type things too.
A:	We like to get out and walk,
A:	and we like the water sports too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that very often.
B:	I, know it.
B:	It is.
B:	Do you work full time?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, part time.
A:	We are going to have a baby in July.
B:	Part time.
B:	Oh.
A:	So part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that definitely takes over your time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it does.
A:	I have been,
B:	Is this going to be your first?
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	I have been doing some cross-stitch for something I wanted to put in the nursery.
A:	So, I have not done that in years,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I have kind of enjoyed that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that is,
B:	it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That is neat.
A:	And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby
B:	Yeah.
B:	I do too.
A:	I just go out just to, just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes, just look.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But you will probably find after your children get bigger, uh, like when they want things like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store, you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	we bought some baby clothes, yeah, last weekend at a garage sale.
B:	And,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I am,
B:	I have become a garage sale shopper.
B:	And it is fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	On the weekends I drive around, look to see, you know, who is selling what.
B:	And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class. And just, you know, all kinds of things like that, that you would probably pay thirty dollars for,
A:	Oh
B:	and I got them for two dollars
A:	Wow!
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah, at a lot of places.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It, it does take more time.
B:	But I do not work,
B:	so, uh, that is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a, have a happy growing up years
B:	and
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
A:	I think that is important too.
A:	I am not going to work after the baby comes.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, Well, that is good.
A:	So, I guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies.
B:	I am glad,
A:	I do not know
B:	Well, at first, when you first have a baby, you, uh, seems to take every moment of your time. Partly because you are not used to, you know, juggling your time around like that.
B:	But, eventually the, you will, you will be doing lots of stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I think, my husband is real into sports too.
B:	He plays on a T I softball team and the church softball team.
B:	And by the time he plays two games a week and I play a game a week, we go to lots of softball
A:	Wow!
A:	Yeah
B:	But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with
B:	and we, that is getting outside and, you know, doing things they like to do too.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah.
A:	So that is good.
A:	A whole
A:	your whole family can enjoy those hobbies.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And one other thing we are doing this year is, uh, we bought Wet and Wild passes.
A:	Oh.
B:	We have never done that before,
B:	but the kids are always wanting to play in the water.
B:	And, uh, like you said, unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play, it is kind of hard.
B:	And, uh, they have real good kiddie areas, uh, at both of the Wet and Wild's around here.
B:	So, we are planning on going two or three times a week
A:	Oh, wow.
A:	That will make the summer go by in a hurry.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think it will.
A:	Keep the kids busy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because my oldest daughter is in school,
B:	and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do.
A:	Right.
B:	So, I think that will be a lot of fun.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So we are looking forward to that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, do you consider yard work a hobby at all
A:	or is that just a chore?
B:	Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun
A:	Uh-huh
B:	But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore.
B:	It's,
A:	Yeah.
B:	our yard has had so many problems.
B:	It has completely died out two times.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, uh, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.
B:	So it has become a chore
A:	Huh.
B:	Do you and your husband like to work in the yard?
A:	Oh, well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
B:	Yeah.
A:	I like to put flowers out and, you know, a few little things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But as far as mowing every week, and finding time to get all that stuff done, it gets to be a chore.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That is true.
A:	Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.
A:	They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that is how sewing.
B:	I love to sew,
B:	and, uh, I wish I had more time to do it.
B:	But sometimes I will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than
A:	Yeah.
A:	If it does not go quite, quite right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Another thing I enjoy doing is cooking.
B:	I, I like especially,
B:	it is real strange,
B:	but I like to cook for other people.
B:	Like I have a friend that is, uh, pregnant
B:	but she can't get up and walk around right now.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	So, I enjoy, you know, cooking things to take over to her house
B:	or,
A:	Oh, that is nice.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it, it is fun for me to do that.
B:	It is, it is something I enjoy doing.
B:	It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us
B:	It is kind of like when you are a kid and, and someone else's house was fun to clean,
B:	but you did not want to do your own
A:	Yeah.
A:	Your,
A:	How funny.
A:	I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working, when I do not get home until five-thirty or six, and I have to cook and clean up,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	it is not, it is not fun.
A:	But I think I will like it better.
B:	Yeah.
B:	When you are home it's, it makes a difference.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It sure does.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	we have done a little bit of camping.
A:	We like that.
A:	It's,
A:	there again, it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend, but the next.
B:	My parents go camping a lot,
B:	and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them
B:	and,
A:	Oh.
A:	That sounds fun.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We are really looking forward to it.
B:	The girls love it.
B:	They have been a couple of times, and, uh, just getting to be outside, you know, all the time and sleep in a tent. And that is really fun to them.
B:	So, We are looking forward to that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that sounds nice.
A:	I, I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think so.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My, uh, my husband loves to fish.
B:	I am not much into fishing,
B:	but, uh, my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish
B:	so I think it will be real good for them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They can go fishing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we have camped with some friends who have young children
A:	and, uh, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, they have so much fun doing that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, she is really looking forward.
B:	I am hoping,
B:	that is another thing though, when sometimes your, uh, hobbies can interfere with each other.
B:	Because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I am saying, no, no
A:	Yeah.
A:	Skip this tournament
B:	Yeah.
B:	If you are doing a lot of things, sometimes you have conflicts,
B:	and you have to decide what you enjoy the most.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?
B:	Well, not really right now.
B:	I keep thinking when the kids get bigger and I have a little more time, uh, I might take up, there is, I would love to cross-stitch.
B:	I think cross-stitching is so pretty,
B:	but I have never done any.
A:	It is not too hard.
A:	It is,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I crocheted when I was younger.
B:	It is funny, when I was in high school, I made a blanket.
B:	And,
B:	but you know, I can't even remember how I did it now
A:	Yeah
B:	It has been so long since I did it that
B:	but,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I started to to knit a sweater.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I got off on my rows somehow,
A:	and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And then I tore it out and threw it down.
A:	And I never have, picked it back up again,
A:	and now I can't remember anything about it
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I did the same thing.
B:	Uh, when I was pregnant with my first daughter, I was really bored,
B:	and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	It was a real pretty rug.
B:	And I thought, well I could use this as a gift or something, you know.
B:	And oh, it was so,
B:	it was beautiful,
B:	but I did not realize how long it took.
B:	And I got about two, two-thirds of it done,
B:	and then I just,
B:	I had the baby
A:	Yeah
B:	And then it was just like I forgot all about it.
A:	Forget it.
B:	And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet,
B:	and I will find that thing.
B:	And I will think, oh, maybe I ought to get the rest of that out, you know, and finish it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, uh, hobby.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I remember that.
B:	It seemed like people did them a lot.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, uh, people do not do that much any more.
B:	So, it was something easy I could do
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	They are pretty easy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it has been real good talking to you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You too.
A:	And I hope you enjoy your camping trip.
B:	Oh, thank you.
B:	And thanks for calling.
A:	Uh-huh. *used to mean "you're welcome"
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	in Well I always think I'm paying too much taxes.
B:	How about you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh definitely
A:	Seems like,
B:	Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.
B:	I mean, you know, they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to, uh, enact this I think, uh, the, um, other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling
B:	so they keep trying to say we may need a, uh, state income tax
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that, uh, we probably will have to have, have to, uh, have a state income tax because, uh, Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries, uh, well I, I, come here from New York
A:	and New York had a state lottery,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it really raised a lot of money for the, for the state.
A:	Uh, although we,
A:	in New York we had to pay a state and a city, uh, tax.
A:	And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though.
B:	Yeah,
B:	makes quite a bit of difference in your, uh, well your income level.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, because other states quite a a chunk out for, uh, city and state taxes
B:	so you're, uh, looking at your yearly salary, it makes quite a difference.
A:	It sure does make a difference.
B:	A little more take home here
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you live in Dallas?
B:	Yeah,
B:	Richardson area.
A:	Oh, you do?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I work at, well mainly the Expressway Site is where I work like
A:	Oh, I do too.
B:	Oh, okay
A:	Okay,
A:	and then, you know too, that, um, taxes are, are less, like if you live in Mesquite.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there, uh,
B:	Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, um, Dallas County area because, what do we pay, like eight and a half percent, something like that for the, uh, sales tax.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Eight point five.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which, yeah, that really is pretty high.
A:	Is it the
A:	is it, uh, less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County?
B:	or I guess maybe if I was going to buy a car or something, maybe I would consider where I was buying it, to try to, you know, save a little bit on that sales tax, because on a car that really kind of mounts up
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it sure did
A:	and then once you could deduct at least some of that, um, off, off your income tax
A:	and you can't do that anymore.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It really hit me yesterday, I had, uh, air conditioning service for my car done.
A:	And I had a little, little, uh, coupon special that was twenty-two dollars for, um, air conditioning service where they, uh, checked it and recharged it and put one, one pound of freon in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and if you needed another pound of freon they
A:	it, it was like seven dollars and something.
A:	And then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something, it all came out to, I, I ended up paying like thirty-four dollars.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
B:	that's true.
B:	Although I I wish, you know, overall they'd try the lottery again.
B:	When did you first come to Texas?
A:	Really, where did you come from?
B:	Um, well, Ohio, kind of.
B:	My parents live in Ohio.
B:	I had lived a little while in Michigan,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh, more years than I ever did in Michigan.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, I did visit, uh, Michigan, I visited Kalamazoo once.
A:	My sister used to live there.
B:	Oh, okay
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you know, when we first came down here, I really thought this place was somewhat backward, I mean, I was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday.
B:	Remember that?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, there were stores that you could go to, uh, you know, like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to
A:	and you could shop until like twelve or one o'clock that night
A:	and that was like, that was really the only night they were open that late,
A:	but it was Christmas eve.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And when I came to Dallas, I thought I was going to do that Christmas eve
A:	and I couldn't find hardly anything open, after five o'clock in the afternoon.
B:	Were you shocked like, oh no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.
A:	An I was, oh, I was, I really, I really was stuck
A:	And I think Target was the one that stayed open later than any, anybody else.
A:	And, uh, I was able to pick up a few things in there,
A:	but, boy I was, I was really shocked.
A:	And then another shock I had well, when I went to, um, to buy a slice of pizza and found out that I had to buy the whole pie.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, few places now seem to do it by the slice
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	now,
A:	but they,
A:	back then they didn't.
B:	Right.
A:	When I first came, no.
A:	Anyway,
B:	Well the, the, uh, there was other things too, I mean, I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here, to get them to, uh, come to the, you know, the correct decade here and century.
B:	Um, I couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer, alcohol, whatever, in the car!
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	voice says, that's not the I mean, you could always, um, uh, be careful about that back then because, uh, you know, if if a cop stopped you then you would, um, you know, get arrested or what not.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and talk a talking about alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that, and the taxes on a package of, of cigarettes.
B:	And people would just drink openly.
A:	I used to smoke, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, that would have been enough to, to make me, me give them up.
A:	The price of them now,
A:	but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems.
B:	Oh.
B:	I don't smoke,
B:	so I don't really know what the, taxes are and stuff on it.
A:	Well,
A:	Well they're like two,
A:	or, I, I believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now.
B:	Um.
A:	A little bit, a little bit more in some places.
B:	So you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes.
B:	Huh.
B:	Gee.
A:	Um, because I remember we went to, to Oklahoma to this bingo place. This Choctaw Bingo, uh, a couple weeks ago
A:	and somebody that went with me bought a carton for, uh, ten dollars and something
A:	and they really thought they were getting a big discount.
B:	They're cheaper there?
A:	Well because, it's, you know, the Indians, I don't think they pay tax.
B:	Oh!
A:	In, in Oklahoma.
B:	Oh, I got you,
B:	okay.
A:	And, uh, it was a Indian, well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Although I didn't see very many Indian people in there
A:	There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's, it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth.
B:	Well how did you do?
A:	I won a dollar
B:	A dollar, oh well,
B:	but you had fun playing, right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I had fun, uh, a couple on the bus won some money.
A:	One, one guy won
A:	Okay,
A:	do you have any pets?
B:	Yes,
B:	I've had, I have had a number of them in my lifetime
B:	and I've,
B:	I am a Golden retriever fan,
A:	Oh.
B:	but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.
A:	Oh
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	Instead of being carried
B:	Yes,
B:	well, they were,
B:	they really wanted something teeny tiny,
B:	and I, uh, really wanted that retriever's disposition. Uh, the ultimate to tolerant, trainable disposition,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Really.
B:	so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get.
B:	And they all said, Golden Retriever
B:	and I said okay, put it under twenty pounds.
B:	And the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a,
A:	Huh.
B:	Do you know what that is?
A:	Yes,
A:	I've seen those.
A:	They're cute.
B:	They're cute.
B:	They look like an air headed let me tell you.
B:	They're calm, they're not yuppie , they're trainable, they're, uh, very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is.
B:	They're not dignified like a retriever can be.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So how old is your retriever?
A:	Oh, she's about four.
A:	She's not completely pure.
A:	We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy.
A:	She looks like a
A:	she looks just like a Golden Retriever,
A:	but she's a little bit smaller.
A:	She's like fifty-five pounds.
B:	Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females.
B:	What you,
A:	Is it?
B:	yeah,
B:	what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers, this, you know, plus eighty to a hundred pound range.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That is not breed standard.
A:	Huh.
B:	Fifty-five is the minimum
B:	but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five.
B:	And the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.
A:	Oh, huh.
B:	So don't say she's small, just say she's perfect.
A:	Yeah.
A:	She's perfect.
A:	Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
B:	Yep.
A:	but, but we love her anyway.
A:	She's just a lot of company to us.
A:	We didn't,
A:	we haven't had any kids
A:	and we're expecting a baby this summer,
A:	but up until then, she's been our substitute kid
A:	and she was a lot of fun.
B:	Well, they are, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because I had a retriever, actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross. Which is a really nice animal
A:	Right.
A:	Oh.
B:	and fortunately it was just like a retriever
B:	and then I've had a retriever.
A:	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
B:	It was gorgeous.
B:	It was just gorgeous. I mean just gorgeous.
B:	Um, and they both, you know,
B:	both the half breed and the pure breed had the, uh, what I consider the, the, the perfect disposition.
B:	But you know what, you know what scares me about Golden Retrievers?
B:	Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders. Which is probably where yours came from. People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic.
B:	And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better.
B:	And when you start doing that you really tamper with, you know, the, all the, the years of, uh, culling litters
B:	and, and, uh, you tamper with what the dog innately is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We
B:	when I was,
B:	when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.
A:	Right.
B:	And I ended up getting one that, uh, came out of a, a, a hunting stock because I wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb, dumb retrievers
B:	and I'm, and I really fear for the breed because I love that breed,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.
A:	We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever
A:	and those dogs have been having seizures,
A:	and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You bet you.
B:	You bet you.
B:	You know how they came up with the retriever, don't you, the Golden?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It was bred out of several different retrievers,
B:	and they bred it for companionship and, uh, uh, disposition and, and ability to hunt.
B:	It was kept only by kings.
A:	Oh.
B:	But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years
B:	and since it slept in the castle with its master, I mean it had, it had to be of a disposition to make it, you know, an animal you could keep around that closely.
B:	But they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect.
B:	Now, you know, that seems like a cruel thing to do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	On the other hand, you sure, you know, they sure created a, a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They did.
A:	I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before.
A:	We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds
A:	and all the other,
A:	we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs
A:	and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down.
A:	And one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling
A:	And that, was mine.
B:	Well, I tell you, you know the, the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German Skutzhund, and a makes a I always forget the third one. I can see it.
B:	Uh, uh,
B:	but the third one is a children's dog.
A:	Oh.
B:	And there are distinct breeds in Europe.
B:	Now what happened over here was is that people saw the, the first, um, which would actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.
B:	And it was known as a German shepherd here.
B:	So they created a breed standard. The American Kennel Club did.
A:	Oh.
B:	That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, uh, Alsatian that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.
A:	Huh.
B:	And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.
B:	And they bred a dog that I it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you.
B:	That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them, because they would turn on on their handlers.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible.
B:	So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this.
B:	So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be. Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.
B:	It's just,
B:	you see them in Europe
B:	and they're just lovely.
A:	Huh.
B:	But you'll see,
B:	I mean, if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German Shepherds, they will say on them, bred for disposition, A K C conforming which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog.
A:	Huh.
B:	This is bred for,
B:	and they had to go through and destroy a, for a while there, about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred.
A:	Wow.
B:	Because they were looking for this disposition.
B:	And nowadays you, you'll get, you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific, you know, breeder handler.
B:	They will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog.
A:	Huh.
B:	But ...
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I'll start off being controversial.
A:	I'm in favor of it.
B:	That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.
A:	Well, it seems to be in the current situations
A:	but, uh, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.
B:	Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.
A:	Okay.
B:	I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, uh,
B:	Crimes against children is one of them.
A:	Oh, definitely.
A:	Any, any crimes against person, uh, I feel, uh, there should be more than a slap on the hand, and being sent to prison and being released in, uh, two or three years.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Actually, I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries.
B:	If you steal, you lose a hand.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's a,
B:	You know, uh, if you kill, you lose your life.
B:	What's wrong with that?
A:	I don't see a thing wrong with that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I believe that, uh, Well, it's just an, an example.
B:	Uh,
A:	I think there's, uh, someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they were interviewing the, the,
A:	a young lady was killed sometime back, a young girl.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, how do you feel about this?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they want the person punished and punished, properly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Deciding what that proper punishment is, is one thing.
B:	I think that there should be no way, I, I realize that innocent people could go to, uh, what is it, lethal injection now.
A:	Yes.
B:	Innocent people could do that,
B:	but for every innocent person who would be executed, hopefully there would be ten guilty.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I feel like the, the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost, at like thirty thousand dollars, a year to keep someone in prison.
B:	Uh, Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	To maintain a prison
B:	that's right.
B:	That's stupid.
A:	And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There are more, and more instances being on the news,
B:	Sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or this individual was out on the streets, on probation or parole and killed someone else. Or, seriously injured someone.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, I don't have solutions to the problems,
B:	but you know you have these,
B:	this would be nice if
B:	and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory, blinded her.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.
A:	Yes.
B:	I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual or the family of an individual. Uh, who has been harmed you, you, you know.
A:	Yes,
A:	indeed.
A:	Yeah.
B:	People who kill policemen. And I
A:	Yeah.
A:	No.
A:	Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind uh, the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, uh, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. Uh, aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the, the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.
B:	I don't, I don't agree with the length, of the sentence though.
A:	Well, Well, but here again, uh, if a matter of expediency, part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years.
B:	I think expediency is the answer.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	There should be some, uh,
A:	I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, uh, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years, because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities, there might be.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right,
B:	technical,
B:	I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals.
A:	Right,
A:	there's got to be a, there's got to be a time limit.
B:	you can appeal it once.
B:	I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands, then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is, if, if it is, contradictory.
A:	A, a legit, legitimate appeal, not a technicality, of, uh, if, and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, uh someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of, of the process in which the criminals were apprehended.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, uh, you know the guy is guilty.
B:	You know he's done what he's done.
B:	You, you may have stood there and seen it.
B:	But because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested, you know, he, he goes free.
A:	He didn't see his, lawyer as quickly as he should have, or some, some Mickey Mouse type thing like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent.
B:	It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.
A:	Oh, yes
B:	And, uh, I, I just don't think that,
B:	I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers
A:	Yes.
B:	I hope you're not a lawyer
A:	No,
A:	I'm not a lawyer
A:	I,
A:	I'm an accountant
A:	and I agree.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers, to a degree.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	That's why you check books out from the library.
A:	There you go.
B:	But I really believe that our justice system is, is the best around
B:	but it's not perfect,
B:	and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact. *in tact intact
A:	Well, it's, it's a case that we have a, a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.
B:	That's right.
A:	So that's how we get caught in this, uh sort of a catch twenty-two.
B:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's right.
A:	But you have to continue, uh, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.
B:	That's right.
B:	And, and, it,
B:	I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that just,
B:	that really does ruffle my feathers, at times.
A:	Yes It does, most people.
B:	I mean I can just get so, aggravated about it.
B:	But, you know, it's, it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem
B:	And I hope, not lawyers
A:	Again one of our one of our problems is that, uh, our legislature and the state and our national congress, the majority of the members thereof are lawyers.
A:	Well, uh, if you had to pick a, a type of music that you like, would you be able to? *functions as a qw
B:	Well, I could pick country music. *answered as if to a qw
A:	Country music?
A:	I,
B:	As I've gotten older, I've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies.
B:	Not originally.
A:	Not originally.
A:	Where you from?
B:	Georgia.
A:	Georgia.
A:	Okay, well, see
A:	I'm, I'm from Chicago,
A:	so uh, I'm kind of in a different category here. Uh,
B:	If you had to pick one, what would you choose?
A:	Uh, I would probably go with,
A:	it's tough, uh, I think I would just stick with the classics. Only because, uh, I like music just for music's sake
A:	and uh, you know, I'm from the era where, you know, we had all the rock and roll.
A:	I'm forty
A:	so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal
A:	and, uh, that was a real interesting time
A:	and, you know, the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound.
A:	Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart
A:	I mean because it's just,
A:	it will always be there.
A:	It's classic
A:	and I don't have to worry about, you know, what's current and what's not because I haven't been current with music for a long time.
A:	But, you know, same, uh,
A:	and, as far as country music is, I've never really, uh, listened to it.
A:	I mean because that's just,
A:	it was,
A:	it wasn't part of what I knew,
A:	so, there you go
B:	Well, I understand what you're saying.
B:	I think if you would listen to it a little, you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the, both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that, that we both lived through.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh
A:	I,
A:	it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too.
A:	I, I know, well, whenever they talk about, uh, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me.
A:	It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.
B:	Well, there's some joy in it also.
B:	But, mostly it, it just tells a story about life.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I must say, though, uh, I listen to Amy Grant.
A:	Do you consider her country?
B:	I don't know.
B:	I'm not all that familiar with her work.
A:	Uh, uh, let's see. Well, name some people that are country that I should listen to
A:	That would be good.
B:	Well, I kind of like, uh, I like groups like the Statler Brothers. And the Judds, certainly.
A:	Okay.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I, I must admit that's, yeah, they're fantastic,
A:	so, uh, uh,
B:	Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.
A:	She's something, though.
A:	She's got so much energy
B:	That's true.
A:	Well, I guess I, I have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that I do like some of that.
A:	Uh, Dolly Parton, she's kind of,
A:	is she kind of country?
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Kind of
B:	That's certainly where her roots are.
A:	Right down there.
A:	Uh, uh, how about the Oak Ridge Boys.
B:	Very much so.
A:	Very much.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I like them, too.
A:	So I guess I've had a smattering
A:	and I just, uh, you know, picked,
A:	I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north, you know.
B:	That's true.
A:	You know, so, well, I think there's music all around anyway.
A:	I mean, I think life is just music,
A:	so, you know, you can hear it wherever you want
A:	and, uh, and I've, I've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because I just don't understand it.
A:	But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like
A:	so,
B:	Well, it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a, a record of the rap songs of the eighties.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the greatest hits,
A:	right,
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, I mean, it, it, it'll, if it stands the test of time, we'll see.
B:	That's true.
A:	And, uh, then it'll,
A:	if it survives, then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, hey listen what we listened to
B:	Yeah
A:	Can you believe this sort of thing,
A:	but, uh, you know, I, I think of,
A:	I get real tickled when I listen to some of these old Beatle, uh, music, you know, the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still
A:	and, and, uh, you know, all these rocks, rock stations call it classic soft rock, you know
B:	Right.
A:	But we used to listen to it full blast
B:	Of course.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff,
A:	but, I don't know.
A:	Well, you got any more?
B:	Well, the big key is that, I think you've already stated, that all music is rooted in the classics
B:	and it has grown from there. this short.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	Okeydoke,
A:	well, it was great.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And we'll, uh, listen to some more music
A:	and, uh, I'll look at some country.
B:	You bet.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	we can start.
B:	Okay.
B:	Hi.
A:	Hi.
B:	How many children do you have?
A:	I have four.
B:	Oh, four,
B:	okay,
B:	okay.
A:	How many do you have?
B:	Well, I have two children and, uh, two stepdaughters.
A:	Okay.
B:	So we have four altogether, too.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Are you, are you running ragged these days?
A:	Well, no,
A:	because mine are all grown
B:	Oh, they are.
B:	Oh
A:	So the topic for me,
A:	I, I can only relate now to my grandchildren.
B:	Oh, well good.
A:	I do keep my,
B:	Impart me some wisdom, Catherine
A:	Uh, I do take care of my youngest granddaughter, uh, most every Saturday.
A:	Uh, my daughter and her husband work Saturdays.
A:	My daughter is, uh, uh, doing a schedule of, uh, twenty-four hours on the weekend,
A:	but she gets paid for forty.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And Dave is, uh, in supervisory work
A:	and he has to work almost every Saturday
A:	so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	How old is your granddaughter?
A:	She's three.
B:	Oh, so she's a little one.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	She's, she's little
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	She's says how are you doing grandma today.
B:	Oh
A:	Whoa
B:	Are you surviving.
B:	Is she your oldest child?
A:	Oh, no,
A:	no,
A:	no.
A:	No,
A:	she's my baby.
B:	Oh.
A:	She's my baby,
A:	yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	She was a miracle baby.
B:	Was she?
A:	Yeah,
A:	she really was.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	Now do your other grandchildren live in the Dallas area?
A:	Yes,
A:	they do,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Do you get to see them?
A:	They really do,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	How nice.
B:	What a treat.
B:	You know, being from Plano, you know, I know so very few people who have extended family in town.
B:	I'm real jealous when I hear that somebody has a grandma around because we don't,
A:	Oh
A:	yeah,
A:	that's really,
B:	and,
A:	that's really wonderful.
B:	It is,
B:	it is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help
A:	Yeah.
B:	We don't, we don't have that luxury.
B:	But, we have lots of friends,
B:	and, and everybody tends to be in the same boat.
B:	So we, we trade off a whole lot with friends and, you know, run here and run there.
B:	We're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now.
B:	And we have three playing baseball.
A:	Oh, that's marvelous.
B:	So
A:	Well they keep you hopping, I'm sure.
B:	They definitely do.
A:	Well, I know, uh, that, uh, one of the ladies I know, they are very involved with their little girl
A:	and, and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for, uh, her musical, uh, talents her sports abilities
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I think because she is, uh, the only child that they concentrate, uh, they would like to have more,
A:	but that hasn't been, uh, possible.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, she's tried many, uh, avenues
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and so now it's just, you know, that she's kind of resolved herself that, yes, this is going to be the only one
B:	Yeah,
B:	and she devotes,
B:	yeah.
A:	And they're focusing on all of her, uh, welfare.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, our kids, you know,
B:	uh, my daughter uh, sings with Younger Generation, I don't know if you've ever heard of them.
B:	There they're a singing group here in Plano.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And they're part of the uh, Plano Children's Civics, Civic Chorus.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they're going to Washington, D. C. next December Uh, to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time.
A:	Oh, how wonderful.
B:	Isn't that neat?
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, So we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get, uh,
A:	That's wonderful.
A:	Well, that's wonderful.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It is.
B:	So, you know, and then she plays softball
B:	and my son plays baseball
B:	and my stepdaughter plays softball
B:	so we, we tend to do a lot of running.
B:	Things are very different nowadays than when I grew up
A:	Oh, they are.
B:	and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know,
B:	I don't remember doing all these things.
A:	No.
B:	I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,
B:	but we had more, I guess family time alone where we did nothing. Which was good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you're,
A:	Now I think everything is doing, doing, doing, out of the house. Which can be very hectic.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	It can be
B:	and, and sometimes I, you know, I kind of long for the good old days when we didn't do all these running.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it wasn't so
B:	But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents
B:	and we've had a lot of fun with that, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You have to look on that, on the, uh, positive side of that.
B:	It's just different.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's just a different lifestyle.
B:	It's just very different.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	My, uh, second grandson is in A Cappella
A:	and I know what you're talking about when he's involved, you know, the children are involved in that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he's been,
A:	he has traveled
A:	and they have won awards,
A:	so I
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, I know where you're coming from
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's, it's very nice.
B:	It is very nice.
A:	I think, uh, uh, those type of children, uh, that are involved in things like that, their, uh, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.
B:	Well, I think so,
B:	and, and I think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, your band, your your sports team you know, you all have to pull together.
A:	Right.
A:	Going to,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	A, a, a team effort,
A:	yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and so I've been real pleased with that, too.
B:	I think they've learned some real good life skills. Uh, you know, being involved in all those things.
A:	That, That's wonderful.
B:	And, uh,
A:	That's really is nice to have in your background, that, you know, then you can, you're, you can be very flexible.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, there's less, uh, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	And I think it's a step, a, a giant step of progress, I really do.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, I,
B:	Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.
B:	What is the best advice of mothering that you know?
A:	The best of, Well, uh, Cathy, I think if you look to the Word of God and, uh, think on the things that are pure and lovely
B:	Besides don't sweat the small stuff
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's good, that's real good advice.
A:	and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And keep your mind on positive things
A:	and, and stress that to your children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, even if they're, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are, uh, not negative and that are positive things in their life
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern
A:	and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	Well, I would agree with that.
B:	We're also real active in our church
B:	and my kids do an awful lot with that.
B:	Allyson sings in the choir.
B:	I told her that's a gift from God
B:	and you need to return that back.
A:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	That's right.
B:	And you owe, you owe that back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and and that's real nice.
A:	Right.
B:	I'm real proud of her.
B:	I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing.
B:	You know, that's, that's real neat.
A:	Well, if she looks, if she looks at it as you suggest that, that that's, that she can give her, her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and, and, uh, that's ...
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, do you work outside the home?
B:	No,
B:	I do not.
A:	Okay,
A:	wow
B:	Do you?
A:	Have you?
B:	Have I?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, no,
B:	not actually
A:	Okay,
A:	well, yes I do.
B:	Okay.
A:	In fact, I am at work right now.
A:	Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela.
A:	Uh, I think what is really important, uh,
A:	of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job.
A:	And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits.
A:	Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
B:	Right.
A:	Okay.
A:	And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. And, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
B:	Okay.
A:	Like, uh, perhaps, uh, he has, uh, the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family, uh, uh, and how much coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um, probably dental.
A:	How important you think that would be.
B:	Right.
B:	I, I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.
A:	Because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
B:	Exactly,
A:	Right,
B:	exactly.
A:	right.
B:	Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
A:	And they always have surprises for you.
B:	Exactly,
A:	With children,
B:	they always do.
A:	You know, and so, it's, it is, uh,
A:	we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
A:	You would still have something.
B:	Exactly.
B:	You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
A:	Right.
B:	Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse
A:	and she just received her masters degree
A:	and she is now into consulting
A:	and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
B:	Right.
A:	And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles and professions.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Would,
A:	it would, It would be just futile.
B:	And it would be just,
A:	And they would not have the quality,
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,  center.
A:	And they,  would be deprived of their mother.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	No,
A:	I understand that totally
B:	Besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
A:	Oh, I hear ,
A:	Yes,
A:	that's true.
B:	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
A:	Right.
B:	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
A:	Yes.
A:	Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting?
A:	Do you think that would be, acceptable?
B:	I think
B:	I, think it would be fair.
A:	I do too.
B:	I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
A:	Right,
A:	that you,
A:	Right.
A:	That's right.
B:	But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
A:	With the company than,  than having to go,
A:	That's ,
A:	that's right.
A:	Yes,
A:	I, agree with that.
B:	I think it would be really. really great.
A:	That would be fair.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I do.
A:	Uh, and how, how do you feel about, uh, let's see, eye care?
B:	Eye care is good.
B:	I do not,
B:	I am not
B:	I do not think we have that on our policy.
A:	Okay.
B:	But, uh, we,
A:	Vision, I guess it's called, vision care.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It would be great, I mean, uh, the glasses that,
B:	the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.
A:	It depends on who examines your eyes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	If you have an, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, uh, professionals.
B:	Right,
B:	now like my ...
B:	Right.
B:	Well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,
A:	Glaucoma.
B:	Well, she does not have it,
B:	but, she is like, on the verge of it or, something.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	so,
B:	Her eyes are changing,
A:	Yes.
B:	and she has to be tested periodically.
B:	And, and those are expensive tests.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes,
A:	they are.
B:	Now, I think your insurance covers her on that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know,
B:	that's,
A:	Right,
A:	that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
B:	Right.
A:	Yes,
A:	and, you know, we have, uh, needs in our life that are unique to us
A:	and, uh, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, we are all different
A:	so,
B:	Now, I would like to see better dental insurance to me.
B:	Was that our beep?
A:	Well, no
A:	that's my other phone.
B:	Oh.
B:	Huh.
A:	So, that's it
A:	that's okay,
A:	my,
A:	that phone is ringing to an empty desk
A:	and she's on vacation,
B:	Okay.
A:	so, it's okay.
B:	But, with the three children um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's very expensive.
B:	because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well.
B:	For the, the orthodontia stuff.
A:	Yes,
A:	that's true.
A:	Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
A:	Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, uh, not, uh, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I know, two of my daughters had to have that
A:	and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing and when they were young.
B:	Right.
B:	My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	major.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit
B:	and it's like four hundred dollars,
B:	and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.
A:	Well, I tell you I, I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in, in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's, it's less painful and less expensive.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds like it would hurt more.
A:	I, I know,
A:	but it, it's, it's, uh, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
B:	Oh, gosh.
B:	I, I would much rather that, do that, to myself than make my five year old go in and do it.
B:	That would kill me.
A:	Do you have any personal feelings on, on uh, the subject?
B:	Well, uh, capital punishment is a hard thing,
B:	but, uh, there's been several,
B:	there have been several things that have happened where I felt like if I had been involved in it I would have had to, to go along with, with that being the punishment given to, to the people.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	There have been some things, you know,
B:	there's things done that are just
A:	So outrageous.
A:	I know,
A:	I know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that I do not know how,
B:	I do not really there's any other way to deal with it.
A:	Right.
A:	Well I, I guess my concern is what we are reading, especially in Texas right now with them letting out the people out of jail as soon as they are out of prison when they do and having them go right back the day they get out, back in crime. And especially when they are assaulting,  people and then killing people, I mean, the man who, killed those three sheriffs deputies, he is out free, walking the street.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think that that, that,  that's a really,
A:	I have a real problem,  with that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	if it's a,  if it's a clear and present danger, I mean it,
A:	I think so.
B:	But, it's something that's really hard to deal with, the way that our justice system is right now, is basically set up in lawyers
B:	and, and anybody, will tell you that, uh, it is set up right now, all the laws protect the criminal.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	They are the ones with the rights.
B:	They have the right to, uh, you know,
B:	I think I watched something last week, uh, , I am sorry, the accused has the right to a speedy trial.
B:	But, the victim does not have the right, does not have the same does not have the same, the same emphasis on those things, as far as they are concerned,
B:	so, now the accused can, can ask for delays and extensions
B:	and, what do they call,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	whatever they call them, you know.
A:	And meanwhile, the witnesses, move and die
A:	and and they,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	exactly.
B:	Continuance,
A:	and there's no one to face them.
B:	They can get continuances on for years, before the thing ever comes to trial
B:	and that makes the victim suffer, more.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, they can not get any, if the judge is going to have any award to the victim, it just puts off their collecting it. *probably should be cannot
B:	The ,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that too.
A:	It's, it's really bad,
B:	Um,
A:	it,
A:	I,
B:	I think that, uh, you know, that there needs to be a way that, you know, once someone has gone through, you know, a trial, I do not know how to fix it.
B:	I mean, it just seems like there, there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, when someone has been,
A:	A time limit too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	when someone
B:	Well, even when someone has been convicted
B:	and, I mean, it's just so, so abundantly clear that they did it.
A:	Right.
B:	But appealing, you know, and continuing to appeal, like four or five or six times.
B:	To have convictions overturned
B:	and then they have to be retried and all that.
B:	It's such a waste of time and energy and money.
B:	And it, it just,
B:	that's what keeps,
B:	that's what is keeping all the, the, you know, the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time, like this.
A:	Right.
A:	Do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the results, they should be consequences of capital punishment,
A:	or, or, are there some murders committed that you think leniency should be shown.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well, I guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that. Uh, you know,
B:	like I, I could see, uh, a first time offender being, you know, maybe, in a, in a robbery situation, trying to hold up a store and getting scared and, you know, firing a gun and accidently killing someone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay, I could see that that might be the situation where, uh, the person could be rehabilitated.
B:	But, I think just out and out murder, and I am talking about, uh, cutting people up you know, where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again, in a serial fashion or whatever That those, kinds of things and any, any kind of violent assault, rape included, needs to addressed in, in, in that context
A:	Okay.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are, because they have had them, they have had them killed when they have,
B:	Well, what bothers me,
B:	that bothers me a great deal,
B:	I had a friend who was a police officer, who was killed in the line of duty.
A:	Um, um, um.
B:	And the thing that was the worst about it is that these, that, uh, two of these individuals were, well all of the individuals involved were very young.
B:	One was technically a minor,
B:	and they had told their teachers that I mean,
B:	repeatedly during high school, they had told their teachers that they were going to be, that they were going to graduate from high school and kill cops
B:	That was what they had told their, teachers,
A:	Oh.
B:	and so that's what they did
B:	And, uh, they were, they were given, I think,
A:	That would be premeditated
B:	Oh, absolutely.
B:	He stopped them for routine traffic violation
B:	and they uh,
B:	several, several things happened that night
B:	but they, they beat him up and took his gun and shot him with it.
A:	Uh, uh, uh.
B:	And it was, it was really terrible.
B:	I mean, uh, I had seen him like three or days before that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He,
B:	we had gone out, uh, with he and his wife
B:	and that was really, really disturbing you know, that that happened.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And these people, you know, in the, in the course of the trial, you know, came up with, with all these, you know, things about well, you know, they were disadvantaged and all this stuff.
B:	Well, nobody is that disadvantaged
A:	No.
A:	Well, that's right,
A:	there's no reason,  for murder.
B:	And there's just no I mean,
B:	No.
A:	I do not care if you are poor or if you are rich or if you are, ugly or what there, that, that's just beyond, the,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think so too.
B:	And that's, uh,
B:	so, I, I do feel strongly about.
A:	and the, all these kids, they have got an excuse for everything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I can see it continuing on when they are adults.
A:	I just,
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's, uh,
A:	I, I sometimes think if I were on a jury and had to make the decision could I.
A:	And I like to think I could, like you,
A:	if, if especially violent crime, where serial type killer or maybe a child has been deliberately killed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	The thing that even though juries sometimes make the decision
B:	and still the people, nothing ever happens to them.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, they stay in jail, they get off time for good behavior and all that stuff, and they get released
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they go right back and do it again.
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you work?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	I think that's the main change.
A:	What do you think?
B:	Well, I think that's a big part of it
B:	and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home
B:	and,  I almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.
A:	Right.
A:	That's right.
B:	But, but yeah, I think that's a big change
B:	I'd like to not work.
B:	What about you?
A:	Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I just,
A:	physically I wasn't able to
A:	and I mean, I love my job.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I have four children,
A:	and that's real hard.
A:	You have children?
A:	I assume so.
B:	Yes.
B:	I have two
B:	and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman,
A:	Right.
B:	but as long as I you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could,  as well as I could et cetera.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids.
B:	Well, I have two.
B:	I have a four year old and a three year old.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we would like two more
B:	but I,
B:	it's like, we talked. Uh, I don't want two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care,  of them which is,   something right now financially it takes both people to work.
A:	Right.
A:	Oh.
A:	It's real hard.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's real hard.
A:	I mean even I,
B:	It's full time work.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It was so hard for me to work full time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, my kids are, are a little older
A:	but then you, then you give up the money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know?
B:	You do there's
B:	of course, you know, everything you give up something
B:	but I just,
B:	I,
B:	the kids are so wonderful
A:	Yeah.
A:	.
B:	But I do think that's one of the major changes. You know,
B:	my mama I remember her being home uh,  you know, she made breakfast in the morning for us.
A:	Yep.
A:	Fine .
A:	Yep.
A:	I know.
B:	And if she worked it was part time
B:	and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school,
B:	and she was there when we got home.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, and,
A:	Well, I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,  which I loved.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm home when they are home.
A:	In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store,
A:	and I'm just really hesitating,  because I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever,  so like seventeen years with my kids.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
A:	I mean, well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
A:	and it was wonderful.
B:	Yeah.
A:	My kids and I, we just had a ball.
B:	See,
B:	and I think,
A:	Of course, their, their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
A:	and we are just running every direction
A:	and,
B:	But see, it's such an important time to be home. You know.
A:	It is.
B:	And that,  was important to me enough,
A:	It is.
B:	you know, my husband was raised, uh,
B:	his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,
A:	Always worked.
B:	and he's like well, you know, what's the big deal about being home,  for your kids.
A:	What, yeah.
B:	Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.
B:	I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed,  Mom at school, you know, she was there to help
A:	Right.
B:	or,  she was there to take you,
A:	Right.
B:	and, and I want to be able to do those things
B:	so.
A:	I think that, you know, it's good.
A:	You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they,  come home
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over.
A:	In fact, everyday,  I've got boys hanging around,
A:	and it's wonderful
A:	I'm real close to the schools
A:	and, you know, we are just
A:	I, I'm very happy to be staying home.
B:	I think that's wonderful.
A:	But again I miss,  the .
B:	So, where do you see,  us changing in the future?
A:	I don't.
B:	Well, see that was one of the things the, the question I think is,  you know, what changes do we see
A:	I keep on working .
A:	Right.
B:	and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere.
B:	I think they are still going to have to work.
A:	That we are because it's so expensive.
A:	If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,
B:	Right.
A:	The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then there is the gas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then there is the lunches and then the day care.
B:	The day care eats,   me alive.
A:	You must pay for ,
A:	day care.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty,  a month  for two kids
A:	Oh  my gosh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	for two.
B:	They would eat you,  alive.
A:	It's almost hardly worth it for you,  to work until they get in school.
B:	I know.
A:	Then you work summers unless you are a teacher.
A:	Are you a teacher?
B:	No,
B:	I'm not,
B:	and I would love,
B:	you, you, you talked about having the summers off
B:	and I thought, oh, that would be so wonderful.
B:	And I love the little preschool they are in.
B:	It's wonderful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, so I feel good about them being there
B:	but it's still not the same.
A:	No.
A:	It's not the same.
B:	It's just not.
A:	I, I don't see things changing really,
A:	and, and it's terrible for divorced women you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Thank goodness I have mine,
A:	and I could get a real good paying job,  if I wanted to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Please come back to work.
A:	and we'll pay you this .
B:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	And it's been a real tough decision
A:	but I'm very happy to be here with my kids.
A:	My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in,  now that I'm home.
B:	That's wonderful.
B:	That's wonderful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm real,
A:	and I'm,
A:	but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis
B:	I like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I know .
B:	Well, we're working on it.
B:	I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be able to stay home
B:	and my kids, of course, will be in school then
B:	but I'll,  be there mornings, I'll be there noons,  I'll be there afternoons and all.
A:	Right .
A:	Yeah.
B:	I feel like,  that's good
A:	Well,
B:	and I can work part days in my husband's business, you know, so that,  he can afford for us to do that, you know.
A:	Oh, that would be great.
A:	Right.
A:	I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children.
B:	So, Utah.
A:	Yes.
B:	That, that's, that's the state that got, was famous when they executed somebody.
A:	Gary Gilmore.
B:	Gary Gilmore.
A:	Yeah.
B:	By firing squad, as I recall.
A:	That's right,
A:	and we still have a death penalty.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Some,
A:	a gentleman, uh, that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned, well, appealed again.
A:	I guess we have the longest, uh, running inmates for death row too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then we had another guy, uh, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law.
B:	Yeah.
A:	He just got a, a new trial because, the judge felt that he was incompetent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, how do you feel about the death penalty?
B:	Well, I, you know,
B:	until recently I've been sort of,
B:	could go either way, you know,
B:	it, it, sort of doesn't much, you know,
B:	it didn't,
B:	it wasn't a strong issue, um, I guess it still isn't a strong issue.
B:	But I must say, I find it very silly, the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes, um instead of dealing with you know, the real problems that, you know, that they're, they're getting votes presumably by, um,
A:	Oh.
B:	I assume they're doing it for that reason
A:	Well, I'm sure that's .
B:	By, by by saying well, this, doing this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.
A:	Well, I kind of agree with terrorism.
A:	I think those guys should be done away with.
A:	That's one of the worst,  crimes in my book
A:	and, uh, drug dealing, um, that's close
A:	but, uh, terrorism definitely. And  uh, selling out your country.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not, it's not enough just to lock them up forever.
A:	Uh, no,
A:	it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.
B:	Not often.
A:	Not very often at all.
A:	We've got these guys in New York that, uh, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, uh, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis  people.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	And I guess they got convicted, the four, of uh, murder.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?
B:	Well, I,
B:	I've
B:	it, it seems like it's gone, gotten carried away,
B:	um, and I, I do find it hard to know where to draw a line,
B:	and so if I had to draw a line, I'd say just no capital punishment.
B:	I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot, whereas I do think that convicting people and, and incarcerating them for a long time, if that could be improved upon, that would have more impact, I think.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You kind of hate to,
B:	No,
B:	what about the argument where, where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a, a more serious capital crime?
B:	I mean, murder, um, because that one at least, you might escape from because his victim, you know, his witnesses will be gone
B:	Doesn't this, doesn't this encourage,  Uh,   More .
A:	You mean  uh, violence?
B:	Doesn't this, yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the the witnesses?
A:	The witnesses?
A:	Well, maybe it would.
A:	Uh, I kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment, uh, as it is.
A:	I think that people who, uh, infringe on other people's rights, uh, and screw up their whole lives with rape, uh, child molesting, uh, terrorism, just uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	There's just like five things that I think they ought to be snuffed for,
A:	but I'm, I'm for it for certain reasons.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that things like rape, uh, you can't get over, uh, it takes a lifetime.
B:	I see,
B:	so, so if, if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty, you believe he should have been, uh, executed?
A:	Uh, if it was,  Yeah.
B:	A six person jury could have decided either way, of course
A:	If it was, it would probably have to be a pattern.
A:	You know, we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out, do the same thing and go back,
A:	and, uh, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child molesting  then snuff them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, the problem is that they've just been let out of jail.
A:	Pardon?
B:	The problem there is that they've been let out jail.
B:	If they've been thrice convicted, they should have been kept in longer.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but we don't seem to keep them long enough,
A:	and then they learn such bad things in jail.
A:	That isn't  a place of rehabilitation.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's for sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to  keep giving them chances.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, let's see,
A:	so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in, uh, compares to how we feel
A:	What's the laws there in D C?
A:	Uh, it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year
A:	but, uh, it's, it's camping.
B:	Really.
B:	When was the last time you went?
A:	The last time I went camping was about, uh, in the middle of October,
A:	and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it.
A:	Had a real good time with the family.
A:	We do an awful lot of camping.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Well, I haven't been in probably about three years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the last time we went was in, um, well, I guess it was, it was like hunting season,
B:	and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake Lake Sam Rayburn which is in East Texas.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes, oh,
A:	Very good.
A:	I bet it's pretty over there.
B:	It is real pretty.
B:	Um, let's see.
A:	What do you think, what kind of  camping, uh, are you talking about?
B:	Do you do a lot of fishing?
A:	Do you go out,
A:	and is camping for you in a motor home, or a trailer,
A:	or do you actually put up a tent
A:	or,
B:	One of the ones that you pull along
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	so you have,
B:	and then is it pop-up?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Pop-up.
A:	A pop-up trailer, huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What do you have?
A:	We have a tent.
B:	A tent?
A:	Yes
A:	So I guess we really rough it.
B:	Really.
A:	And we really enjoy that.
A:	Uh, one thing, uh, I've done all sorts of camping.
A:	I've, I've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier.
A:	I've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out.
B:	So you're a serious camper.
A:	Well, we enjoy it, yeah.
A:	But since I've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms And playgrounds, and so forth,
B:	Well, that makes sense.
A:	so, we really enjoy it.
A:	But also while I was growing up, we did have a trailer,
A:	and, uh, I camped in that trailer and in a tent and in, in log cabins and so forth too.
A:	So a lot of different things.
A:	And yes,
A:	I,
A:	to answer your questions earlier, yes, I, we do enjoy fishing,
A:	and I do go fishing.
A:	Haven't done a whole lot down here.
A:	We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, uh, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, uh, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, uh, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers.
B:	But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean,
B:	what did you normally do?
A:	We normally, yeah,
A:	we did, we did a lot of the fishing,
A:	but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going out and seeing what there was to see, uh, in the area.
B:	I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,
B:	and you do actually camp.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true.
B:	Did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little K O, K O A camps whenever
A:	we never did that.
B:	ever done that?
A:	They
A:	although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds, uh, we've never done that just to go around and camp.
A:	Um, personally, I, when I, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, K O A is, is geared for the people that have a hookup.
B:	That actually travel, what, city to city, state to state.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly,
A:	and, uh, I started out basically camping when I was, when I was in Boy Scouts,
A:	and we did an awful lot of that as, as a Boy Scout group.
A:	As I mentioned earlier, we went into wilderness areas
A:	and we camped in the snow, and in, uh, snow caves,
A:	and, and, uh,
B:	That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.
A:	All right.
A:	And you got a lot of that in, huh?
B:	Yeah
A:	What do you like to do when you go camping?
B:	Um, well, let's see. I just, I mean, I just like to go
B:	and, normally I go with a whole group of friends
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.
A:	Enjoy it, huh
B:	Roast marshmallows.
A:	Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	or, um, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, um, play cards and stuff.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You know, lots, a lot of people I've talked to have said, well, isn't camping boring?
A:	Don't you get, don't you, uh, get bored and not have anything to do,
A:	but I've found out that actually we, we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's relaxing.
A:	and, yes.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Get out,
A:	getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.
B:	Plus, you, um,
B:	kind of makes you appreciate some, a lot of the things you take for granted.
A:	Yeah
B:	Running water
A:	Running water
B:	your hair dryer
A:	and a private bathroom.
B:	curling iron.
A:	Yes
B:	What about your family.
B:	Do your kids and everything like to?
A:	Yes,
A:	they really do, they have a great time,
A:	and like I mentioned, uh, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year
A:	and the last time was in October
A:	and we went up to Lake Bonham,
A:	and there was a playground for them
A:	so they had swings,
B:	Hi.
A:	like child's Hi,
A:	I'm Carol,
A:	and I'm calling from Garland, Texas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	this is
B:	I'm in Dallas.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Because yesterday I talked to someone upstate, I'm not even sure where,
A:	and my husband talked to the people in Utah,
A:	so. Um, anyway, let me press one.
B:	Okay
A:	Okay, um,
A:	let me see, I think we've only planned one family reunion in our life,
A:	so we don't do this too often.
B:	I.
A:	Um, most of my family's in California,
A:	but my husband's is in San Antonio,
A:	and so we did this in San Antonio,
A:	and, um, it was an experience that I, I won't do again
B:	How big a family do you have?
A:	Um, well, it wasn't that big of a family,
A:	but, um, it just got out of hand,
A:	and, um, so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and, and, um, how much, um, beverages we were going to need and this and that,
A:	and oh, it just grew and grew and grew,
A:	and, um, when the time came, only about half that amount of people came.
A:	So, it wasn't, you know,
A:	you have to really just get an accurate amount,
A:	and,
A:	but overall we all had a good time.
A:	We saw people we hadn't see in a while
A:	so,
B:	Did you have people coming from far away?
A:	No.
A:	It was all in the San Antonio area
B:	Well sometimes.
A:	But it, it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing,
A:	and we're going, Oh, my gosh.
A:	So.
B:	Well you have, you have
B:	the family lives too close together, they see each other too often  they don't take that kind of thing seriously.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	basically.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if, uh uh, they come from far away, it's, uh, it, it, they take it more seriously
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I think you're right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My family's not very big
B:	but, uh, we're kind of.
A:	Your family's from where?
B:	Well, I have a, a, a brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago, and my folks live back in Buffalo, New York.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	Uh, I guess we have reunions about once a year or so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We got together over Christmas.
B:	My wife's family, they're, they're all in,
B:	most of them are in upstate New York.
B:	They have regular, uh, regular family reunions every summer.
A:	Oh, those are nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	And I'm, I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and it's, it's just something that they, they plan on doing every summer.
B:	They just have  a weekend picnic,
A:	That's great.
B:	and every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they just plan on being here.
A:	That makes a big difference, too.
A:	I know everybody's real eager to participate.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well that's great.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they, they had a family reunion for, uh, well, for my mother-in-law at her seventy-fifth birthday,
B:	and they managed to get just about everybody, everybody into town, uh, last November including a number of people from out in California.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	So it was a, it was good, it, uh it worked out very well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	One interesting thing that they did at the time is they, um, they videotaped the, the whole shebang which, it made a nice remembrance of, of the entire party.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	more people want to come back again.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they want to come back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good.
B:	So, so that, that works pretty well that way.
A:	My, uh, my grandmother in California is, um,
A:	this is my dad's part, side of the family is planning a reunion, um, this spring,
A:	but we won't be going because, um, I don't know how they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise,
A:	and, um, it seems like most of the family is, uh, going, you know, all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are, most of them are going,
A:	but it's too costly for us.
A:	But anyway, they're going to go on a cruise,
A:	and, um, it sounds really neat, it really does.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I can go for that.
B:	What,
B:	what do,
B:	I guess interesting if you had a, a, a very extended family that, that kind of involved a lot of people that cousins and things that you don't really know, that you've never met, it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I don't know how you would go about, uh, getting them together,
B:	but that, that would be, uh.
A:	And a friend of mine, um, she plans her family reunion, um, every year,
A:	and they go camping,
A:	and she says they have the greatest time,
A:	and she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person,
A:	but she said they all go camping,
A:	and they have a really good for the whole weekend.
A:	So, that's.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I kind of wonder what, what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family.
B:	I had hoped that our, our kids get together at least regularly.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Right now we only have two children
A:	so I,
A:	What are your favorite T V shows?
B:	Uh, I guess one of my favorite ones is CHEERS.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I always liked that one.
B:	They're always so funny.
B:	And I also like the COSBY SHOW
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Those are probably my two favorites.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I rather enjoy the COSBY SHOW.
A:	My wife and I both like COMMISH.
B:	You know, I've watched that one time
B:	and it was really good,
B:	but now that's on, what, Saturday night?
A:	Uh,
B:	Is it Saturday night?
A:	It's either Friday night,
A:	it's either tonight or tomorrow night.
A:	Uh, around here at least.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess it depends on what channel you're getting. You know, what system you're getting it through.
B:	I can't,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I,
B:	yeah,
B:	I saw it one time
B:	and I really liked it,
B:	but I just haven't, uh, seen it, you know, watched it since.
A:	Uh, we, we always enjoyed it.
A:	It, it seems to be kind of halfway between, uh, something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and, uh, HILL STREET BLUES.
B:	Yeah
A:	it's a good show.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the episode that I watched, uh, I liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer, you know, sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous
A:	You
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he seems to do that sometimes
A:	he's tender hearted fellow.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's what first drew us to him, the, uh, the, the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I thought it was a pretty good show.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, Yeah,
B:	I always like,
B:	I, I like to watch like SIXTY MINUTES and TWENTY TWENTY.
A:	uh, I know we, uh, we watch COMMISH any chance we get.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, used to be a big fan of STAR TREK,
A:	but that's kind of,
A:	it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against, uh, anything spiritual.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, anyway,
B:	I've never gotten into the STAR TREK era
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I used to be a, used to be a real big fan of STAR TREK.
B:	Used to be a Trekie, huh
A:	Uh, pretty much, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I always enjoyed the show anyway
B:	Yeah.
A:	And STAR TREK's in a or the, uh, STAR WARS set
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, one of the first STAR WARS movie?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think I watched it like nineteen times.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	You must have some of their lines memorized
A:	Uh, I did at one time
A:	Anyway, Oh, I I was a pretty big fan of that sort of thing.
B:	Wow
B:	Yeah.
A:	Used to, used to read a, read a lot of science fiction work, too.
B:	Uh-huh. going to say, I hear a baby in the background * B.66 and slash units?
A:	But, uh, no,
A:	it, uh,
A:	we don't do a whole lot of T V watching,
A:	but that, uh, I don't know if you heard them or not, I got a twelve year old, twelve week old baby.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that,
A:	between  that and school it's not ,
B:	I imagine  that keeps you busy .
A:	Between him and school, there's not much time left for watching much T V.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, we're, we're expecting our first in about three months,
B:	so I know we won't be watching as much as we do now
A:	Yeah,
A:	this one here is our first.
A:	And we're both full time students
A:	so,
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That must be tough.
A:	What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?
B:	It doesn't matter, just a healthy baby.
B:	Well, we had a sonogram,
B:	but we told him not to tell us,
B:	so it's going to be a surprise
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's the best way.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're going to get for Christmas.
A:	I mean, you know, It's not as much fun.
B:	Yeah
B:	It's, it's not quite the same.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah
A:	Anyway,
B:	I agree
B:	I'm sure we'll be watching more, uh, children oriented television shows.
A:	Oh, I'm about half kid at heart anyway.
B:	Oh, I am, too.
A:	I, I,
B:	I still watch cartoons sometimes, every once in a while when my sister comes to visit
B:	so,
A:	The new cartoons don't seem to be worth much,
A:	but the, uh,
A:	well, a couple of the, uh, ones Disney's doing aren't too bad
A:	but,
B:	Well, you know, it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You know, I remember, like, the FLINTSTONES and the JETSONS
B:	and those were just kind of good old cartoons.
A:	Yeah.
A:	The, the, the worst of the violence in the FLINTSTONES was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot.
B:	Yeah
A:	But, oh, shoot, I mean, blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet, or, or, or you know, or on all the, you know, everything of this species, you know, just all kinds of crud
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
A:	Yeah,
A:	everything's mutations and, and and killing
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, Gone are the days of those things they
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	what was it I, uh, T N, Turner Broadcasting Network used to, used to, uh, do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons, the old cartoons. They used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Those old little ten minute jobs where, uh, the real ballooned looking art work, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
A:	Oh, so what would be the, your favorite meal to cook?
B:	None to cook.
B:	I don't like to cook
A:	Don't like to cook, huh?
B:	Spaghetti, I guess, though.
B:	I make a mean spaghetti.
A:	Make a mean spaghetti, huh?
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh, got kids?
B:	No.
A:	married?
B:	Huh-uh. *According to the following utterance, this is an AFFIRMATIVE answer, so should be "Uh-huh"
B:	Just my husband and I and the two dogs.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So what about yours?
A:	Well, my wife and I and we've got a thirteen week old baby
A:	so don't do much cooking for him yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	So I guess it's supposed to be dinner party, is that what they said?
A:	Uh, yeah
A:	what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party
A:	and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh,
B:	we don't,
A:	Let's see, a good dinner party menu.
B:	Think you,
A:	I suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, uh, something light and easy.
A:	If it was pretty informal about anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sometimes we'll have, uh, we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer.
A:	Breast of chicken
A:	Oh, gosh,
A:	yeah.
A:	How do you usually cook your deer?
B:	Huh?
A:	How do you usually cook your deer?
B:	How do we usually?
A:	Yeah.
B:	On the grill, we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it is good.
A:	I imagine.
B:	Real good.
A:	I would imagine it is.
B:	Either that or hamburgers, we really don't have dinner parties.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I understand.
A:	We just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. Uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, some veggies in it.
B:	Did you kill the deer?
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	No,
A:	the times I've been out deer hunting, I, I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I mean, I get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon
A:	and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles.
A:	So, no,
A:	this was given to us by some friends.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, guy was in a, uh, in a hunting club
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know,
A:	but the whole group goes out hunting
A:	and then at the end of the day, they split it
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share
A:	and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group.
B:	Oh, well, that's nice.
A:	Well, he
A:	they, they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so there's, everybody had deer coming out their ears.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we still got some from last year.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they gave us some deer
A:	and some of it's still in the freezer
A:	and they,
A:	about eight months ago they gave it to us.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We, we either crock pot deer
A:	or we'll, uh, you know, put it out on the grill so that, uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We
B:	we usually have most of it made into, uh, hamburger meat, though. And cook, you know, spaghetti with it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Chili.
A:	That is good.
B:	So,
A:	Deer spaghetti is real good.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Anyway, uh, no,
A:	I think if I was going to have a dinner party, I'd probably have, uh, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, uh, uh, you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, Or maybe have something roasting out on the fire.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Oh, well, anyway. Uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
B:	Um.
A:	Usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over.
A:	Ah, yeah,
A:	we had a, uh, a turkey loaf.
B:	Oh.
A:	Which, uh, kind of taco turkey loaf.
A:	It was good.
A:	Uh, scalloped potatoes.
B:	Oh.
A:	No,
A:	mashed potatoes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Mashed potatoes with, uh, cheese melted over the top of them.
A:	A couple things like that.
A:	It was pretty good little dinner.
A:	Yeah,
A:	usually it's
B:	This isn't a good topic for me right now.
B:	I'm on a diet
A:	Oh, don't you hate that?
A:	I've got a, I got a few pounds to lose myself.
A:	That's okay.
B:	Um.
A:	I've been fighting my weight since I was about ten years old.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have, too.
B:	I was real skinny till I was ten.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I was, left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,
B:	I guess we're ready to talk.
A:	How you doing, Howard?
A:	This is a, a subject that I'm not real well versed on,
A:	but.
B:	Well, let's talk about air pollution.
A:	Okay.
B:	What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?
B:	Or where are you from?
A:	No.
B:	Maybe you're not in Dallas.
A:	Okay,
A:	I'm from the, uh,
A:	I'm from Dallas.
A:	I'm in Richardson.
B:	Okay. Uh,
A:	What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area?
B:	Well, I have some small experience in this area.
B:	The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown a lot of that is, uh, tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, the, one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.
B:	That's because of all the equipment that's being operated. But at the same time, uh, because we don't have, we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we, don't get a lot of particulates.
B:	Now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, power plants since,
B:	many of our local power plants, uh, are natural gas most of the time, uh, the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and N O X.
B:	There's no particulates in natural gas, of course.
B:	And we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products.
B:	We're burning fuel oil and a few other things,
B:	but gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, uh, I guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur.
B:	That's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter the sulphur, yes.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And that's, uh, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur
A:	Sure.
B:	and under the right condition you get H two S.
B:	But, anyway, uh,
A:	Well, you are, you are well versed on the subject, I tell you.
B:	Well, I don't know.
A:	This is not one of my better ones.
A:	I guess, I guess I notice it the most just, uh, in driving around Dallas with all the, the highway equipment that's working on the on, six thirty-five and seventy-five, just the cars in general.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's where I see most of it.
B:	uh, Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is.
A:	Right.
B:	And when they run rich they, they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,
B:	and that's another part of the problem.
B:	The gas is not being burned completely.
B:	But, uh, hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a lot better.
A:	Oh, I don't know, I've lived here since seventy-four, Howard,
A:	and, I I think, I think they been working on the highways around here since I've been here,
A:	and I think, I think they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone.
B:	Well, I guess, I, not trying to top you, but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of Central
A:	Right
B:	and, uh, I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, uh, I don't know, little bit north of Mockingbird on up in, over those hills
B:	and I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road.
B:	Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are, off ramps,
B:	but, gosh,
B:	seems like, uh, those ramps might kill us yet.
B:	I,
B:	hopefully the new ones will be a lot better.
A:	I understand.
A:	I sure hope so, I tell you.
A:	You know, you get out on the, uh, interstate highways versus,
A:	I travel quite a bit
A:	and traveling from, like, Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the, in the stalled traffic and the busy highways, you, you, you're at your best
A:	and, I guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	Ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, I guess towards Waxahachie, Hillsborough on down to Austin, you hit a point down there about, I think where they call Bear Creek exit on just this side of the county line
A:	Yes.
B:	Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.
B:	Have you noticed that?
A:	I tell you what, I, I don't think I really have,
A:	but I'm going that way Tuesday
A:	and I'm going to make it a point to.
B:	Well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing
A:	Sure.
B:	but, uh, I also travel a little bit
B:	and, uh, I don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier.
B:	It may be all in my mind.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	I know going to, uh, uh,
A:	I detest going to Houston because it's such a,
A:	Mike, I'm calling from Dallas, from Richardson.
B:	Oh, okay, great.
B:	I'm in Addison here.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, good.
A:	You know, our subject is on boating and sailing
B:	Right.
A:	and, quite honestly, with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat, I have never really got into sailing or boating.
B:	I do, uh, quite a bit of sailing.
B:	I own a sailboat that I keep it parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop
A:	Oh, do you, well, great.
B:	and we take it out
B:	and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts,
B:	but I haven't really been taking it out, recreationally too much lately
A:	Well, that's neat.
B:	It's just I don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore
A:	Right.
B:	so it's hard for me to get it somewhere
B:	but,
A:	I've seen some nice, nice sailboats.
A:	The guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago, or whatever, he had a sailboat, used to park it right in the, uh, driveway
A:	and it seemed, uh,
A:	I think it held probably, uh,
A:	it must have slept four people anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	this one is not that big.
B:	It's a day sailer.
B:	It does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in
A:	Right.
B:	but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole, back into the main part of the sailboat.
A:	I I understand.
B:	But, but it's,
B:	they're,
B:	they can be black holes to throw money into
A:	I tell you, Oh, they are,
B:	Boats are kind of expensive to maintain.
A:	and, you know, we have a swimming pool at our house
A:	and I think of all the time, now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever, that I put in there, I just could not imagine a boat because I know it's a lot of maintenance.
B:	Especially a bigger one.
A:	Oh, gosh
B:	The bigger they are, if you get a big cabin cruiser or or a big ski boat, power boat, then there's always, uh, stuff to go wrong with it.
A:	yeah.
A:	You bet.
B:	A sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up,
B:	but you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging, uh, everything that's in it.
A:	Sure.
B:	It takes a, a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up it's a lot of fun, I think uh, just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here,
A:	You bet.
A:	I know, my wife and I were first married here
A:	aunt and uncle,
A:	aunt and uncle up in New York, they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay
A:	and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft
A:	and we were involved every weekend in just, uh,
A:	as we visited, we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that.
A:	We just worked all the time.
A:	But their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen.
A:	It was sort of neat.
A:	We,
A:	but I think that was the last time we were really involved,
A:	and that was twenty years ago, or twenty-five years ago.
A:	It is a lot of fun.
B:	and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long, a boat can be a lot of relaxation, uh, to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever, uh, or a cabin or something, depending on how much you like to rough it.
A:	You bet.
B:	But, but it's, uh
A:	I visited my cousin a couple of years ago, my wife and I
A:	and our daughter and he had a place on Lake of the Ozarks
A:	and he had a boat
A:	and, uh, the I never seen so many boats in all my life.
A:	People actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying, townhouse or condominium, whatever they own
A:	and they, they go boat.
B:	Use the boat for transportation.
A:	I mean they go,
A:	if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail, they use the boat.
B:	They just go across the boat and get a, and tie it up and go in, huh
A:	And that was sort of neat.
A:	That, that, that's true, that's exactly how they do it.
A:	They go to dinner that way, go to all the restaurants
A:	and that was sort of a neat setup.
A:	I enjoyed that.
A:	We spent a week with them.
A:	I enjoyed that.
A:	I'm envious, I'm envious of people that have the big boats
B:	That would be fun.
A:	and, uh,
B:	I've just never
B:	I've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat.
B:	Uh, once I get my son into and through with college, he's going to be starting, uh, Rice next year
B:	so he's going off,
B:	but uh, once I get to that stage where I'm not paying for something else and, uh, I don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things, where I've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it, uh, I might do something differently.
A:	You bet.
B:	I might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them, keep it and maybe consider getting a, a better one for me. Uh,
A:	Think,
A:	you think you'd really enjoy it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think I would.
B:	Uh, the sailing part of it I like because it's so quiet.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if you get a big enough one, then you've got a little motor on it also, where if it's light wind, you can still putt around a little bit and have fun.
A:	Oh I,
B:	Or if, or if the wind dies, you're not stuck in the, middle of the lake.
B:	I've,
B:	with my little one, I've been out there many times on a calm summer day, where all of a sudden the wind stops
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's great.
B:	and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in
B:	and and that gets hot and, and wearisome, doing that.
A:	Oh, I know.
B:	And if you if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there, at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in
A:	And putt putt.
A:	Sure.
A:	Well, that's neat.
B:	But it's fun.
A:	Where do you work?
A:	Who are you with?
B:	I own an insurance agency, a managing general, a wholesaler of insurance, uh out in Addison
A:	Well, good.
B:	and, uh, I'm a scout leader, though,
B:	so I'm, I'm out with,
A:	Um,
B:	So you have a son?
A:	I have an older son,
A:	yeah.
A:	He doesn't have any children yet though.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, he's thirty-seven
A:	and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not,
A:	but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That,
A:	I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.
A:	You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.
A:	So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we let the dogs outside
A:	and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
A:	but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.
B:	I would think so.
B:	When you,
B:	when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working?
B:	Did you work
B:	or were you able to stay at home with him?
A:	No,
A:	when my son was at home, I, I did work
A:	and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we always had our days off together
A:	and we went camping on vacations.
A:	So we had a lot of time together that way you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well when my mom, uh,
B:	when I was growing up my mom worked too,
B:	but she worked nights and, uh, as a nurse
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so she was always home for us
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,
B:	but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Well I am sure it was, you know.
A:	But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.
A:	Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, it's really rough.
A:	Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman
A:	and he works like four days on
A:	and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days,
A:	but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.
A:	So, he's got a second job.
B:	Um.
A:	So he's, you know he's not home very often.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that's, you know,
A:	the kids I know miss that.
B:	They really do.
A:	You know.
B:	Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, uh a really hard thing.
A:	Yeah, you know
A:	and I don't know,
A:	I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.
A:	Oh, I am sure they would you know.
A:	So, are you planning on, to having any children
A:	or,
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we are,
B:	we just got married like, like December,
B:	so we are going to wait a year.
A:	Um. Yeah.
B:	And,  Then we will try.
A:	Well that's good.
A:	That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they will be married nine years this year.
A:	So, I don't know.
A:	She's a nurse, you know
A:	and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids,
A:	so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's a possibility.
A:	You know.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, We really want to have a family.
B:	We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself
B:	and  you should, you should be sharing your family. And giving your values, you know, making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	so,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Give them, give them an edge,
B:	but, we feel like, like the first year needs to be devoted to, uh, making the family, the couple strong and secure in their love for each other.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	But then, a family is, is definitely a high priority.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children
A:	or do you, do you work or what?
B:	Well, well I, uh, I am in, I am in a different situation.
B:	I am a missionary
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I am home on furlough.
B:	It called, like
B:	I have worked for four years in Africa
B:	and I come home for a year.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then we go back for four years.
B:	But my husband and I will do the same job
B:	and we will be living in, in Africa
B:	and we will be working together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family.
B:	I mean as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
B:	but, still we will share that job.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we have,
B:	then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know, that kind of thing
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or do you send them away to boarding school
B:	and if you do that when do you do it
B:	and that's a,
A:	Do you play?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, uh, consider myself a hacker.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I'm into it. Uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I'm not as good as I'd like to be
B:	but it's a,
A:	Is anybody?
B:	No
B:	I don't think so.
B:	Uh, I'd started playing when I was in elementary school actually.
B:	We lived  really close to a par three golf course.
A:	Really?
B:	And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week
B:	and then for, uh, for years, I don't know, after elementary school, all through junior high and stuff, I didn't play cause I think I just got so frustrated when I was little I'd, my body wasn't, you know  physically developed and all that kind of stuff
A:	Oh, wow.
A:	Right.
B:	and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back
B:	and I've really been enjoying it.
A:	Super.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's kind of the way I did it too actually.
A:	I, I played, uh, just a tiny bit when I was real young
A:	and then, uh, I I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still. But, and then quit for awhile
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and recently I picked it up, like you say, about a couple of years ago
A:	and, uh, I've been playing, you know, off and on when I can.
B:	Right.
A:	Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I actually live in Florida
A:	so, uh uh, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf.
A:	I was going to say
B:	I mean it's a great game
B:	but I mean to play a really nice course, you've got to have a really big wallet I mean.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, that's true, all too many times.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Fortunately, uh, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public
B:	Right.
A:	and that's pretty, pretty good.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh, attend the Indiana University
B:	and it's the same way here.
B:	They have a really nice championship style course that is fairly reasonable to play on.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Can you get like a, a student discount type of thing
A:	or,
B:	Uh, a little bit but not a whole lot.
B:	I mean I, you'd think you would
B:	but, uh, you don't
B:	so. I,
A:	Yeah.
A:	What, what, what are green fees run there?
B:	Uh, well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course.
A:	Okay.
A:	That's,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida.
A:	But,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	My dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town
B:	and I can play for free there
B:	and it's a pretty nice course.
A:	Really.
A:	Oh, that's super.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And I guess , well it's free for me
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Somebody's paying
B:	but not me.
A:	Well, that's the way to do it though.
B:	Yeah
A:	That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely.
B:	As far as watching golf, I mean, I can watch it on T V
B:	but it's kind of boring.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's nice to see those who , guys.
B:	They have such good style that, uh it's, uh, it's pretty fun to watch.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They need to get a new photography method.
A:	Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball  that's, that's a little difficult.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, it, they do, they do a generally okay job
A:	but like you said, it's, it's kind of boring actually.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What I really,
B:	I, uh, had a chance,
B:	they had the P G A tournament up in Indianapolis last year
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that
B:	and that was really fun.
B:	I mean you knew it
A:	Yeah.
A:	I bet that would be .
B:	I never really thought it was, would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
B:	but, man, it was, it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've never been to a tournament.
A:	Uh, you know, looking at it on T V, you're thinking, man, what a boring thing, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, that's, that's wild though.
A:	I'll have to see if I can't get a chance  to go,
B:	You got
B:	I mean it's, uh, it's a lot more exciting than actually than watching it on T V.
B:	And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around, I mean, it's just, watching them the whole time instead of like on T V, you get to see them make a tee shot
A:	Right.
B:	and then they go off to some other hole
B:	and they come back when they're putting,
B:	but, you know, it's really something else.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can imagine.
A:	What do you do for a living?
B:	Uh, I'm a student right now.
A:	Oh, you are?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Which, uh, which university?
B:	At, uh, Indiana University.
A:	Okay.
A:	All right, great.
A:	What are you going into?
B:	Uh, I don't really know.
B:	I'm a math computer science major right now.
A:	Okay.
A:	Definitely not golf, right
B:	No
B:	I
B:	it'd be nice to be a pro golfer.
B:	I mean, it seems like that, that would be an okay life just to hang out
B:	and,
A:	Yeah.
A:	If you're good, you can really rake in the bucks.
A:	what was  what was that movie that they had out?
B:	Yeah.
A:	there was a movie about a professional golfer
A:	and I, I  can't remember.
B:	Huh.
A:	It was on network T V a couple of times.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, it seems like, well you go to work every weekend. Play, maybe, one, two tournaments a month. You come in about tenth, you'd still  be doing pretty well.
A:	That's right. .
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, yeah.
A:	I guess when I get back, I'm going to school in Florida actually.
A:	Uh, and, fortunately, I've been able to, to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it, it's unfortunate, you know.
A:	You hear about Japan. I guess, you know, it's, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to, like to practice even .
B:	Right
B:	Yeah.
B:	And those fees to join a club.
B:	Like a million dollars or whatever is just
A:	Yeah.
B:	that is out of control.
B:	I mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess they have those, uh, driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other.
B:	Yeah
B:	I saw one of those on T V.
B:	That is pretty wild.
A:	. Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I played, uh, uh, eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in, in Gainesville, as a matter of fact.
A:	And it was really wild.
A:	They were into it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, they kicked our butt all the way to,
B:	Hi
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you work with a company that, uh, gives drug testing
B:	Sort of.
B:	I'm a, I'm a student
B:	but, uh, I'm in the National Guard
B:	and they do a little bit of drug testing.
A:	Oh, they do?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What, uh,
A:	did they do that before you went in or what?
B:	Uh, they, they do it before you go in
B:	and, occasionally they'll have a, a random urinalysis.
A:	Oh, they will, huh?
B:	Yeah.
B:	So you can't be smoking marijuana in, in the military anymore
A:	Oh.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, I've,
A:	I worked,
A:	I don't work right now because my company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt
B:	Oh.
A:	but, uh, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires they was going drug, uh, give them drug tests.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, uh, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there, you know, just stayed there because it was, they had been there for a long, long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, actually, I think they should do it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I believe they should too.
A:	You know, uh, I don't think anybody needs anybody that's, to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	But, uh, I don't know whether I believe that they should just randomly do it.
A:	I think they should kind of warn them, like, you know, well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, you know  that this is what is going to happen.
B:	Oh.
A:	And  then if you don't like it, why then, you know, you'll have to go look for a job someplace else.
B:	Uh,
B:	But after you,
B:	you have, to do randomly otherwise people will cheat.
A:	Well, I suppose you are right there too, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, personally I,
B:	They,
B:	I know when I was doing my, uh, basic training in A I T there was guys who would fool around
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, uh, you do get caught, it is kind of, kind of harsh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I suppose they fire you and everything right then, huh?
A:	Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get,
B:	Uh, we get counseling
B:	and, uh, I think part of our pay is docked if we're  first time offenders.
A:	Oh I,  Oh, I see.
B:	I really don't,
B:	I, I haven't,
B:	I don't do any drugs
B:	so I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well I don't either.
A:	I wouldn't even think about it
A:	I think anybody that does them are dumb, you know.
B:	Crazy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	, really.
A:	You're so stupid, God
A:	and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.
A:	You don't,
B:	Yeah,
B:	wastes your future.
A:	Yeah,
A:	really dumb, huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, Let's see, what else was I going to say here.
B:	Uh, what do you think about our, uh, like, uh, other government agencies testing?
B:	Do you think our government agencies should test?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so.
A:	I think they all should test really you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that, I don't know what's wrong with the people, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I think that the, the government should do something about stopping it completely.
A:	About it coming into our country.
A:	You know, they just slap somebody's little hand,
A:	and, you know, well, don't do that again
A:	and  and then you know, they'll get out
B:	Oh, I know,
B:	yeah.
B:	They aren't .
A:	and they're right back at it again.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right now it is, it's too lucrative for the drug dealers
B:	so the risks are worth it for them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, other than that, why, I don't know.
A:	Like I say, maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job, you know, since my company went bankrupt
A:	and  I'll see what they do, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, like I say, I, I wouldn't care because I, I don't, I don't even smoke
A:	so they can test me all I want.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I wonder what if you take medicine if that would effect it.
B:	Oh see, that's,
B:	it is a problem.
B:	Sometimes some medicines will give off a, a false positive.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see now that  that would be really unfair then, huh?
B:	I've heard of, I've heard of that,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
B:	I believe you should have the testing
B:	but they should be, like, if you get, if you get a positive, they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Find out what, you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, well I guess that's about all we can talk about.
A:	I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.
A:	Okay, Lewis,
A:	and maybe I'll talk to you again.
B:	Okay
A:	Alrighty.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye
A:	Okay. Uh,
A:	we keep a monthly budget.
A:	I just recently stopped working so I can be home with my kids
A:	so we keep a monthly budget
A:	and we try to stick to it
B:	are kitchen noises I know.
B:	It, it's really difficult here. All because there's always something breaking.
B:	Car needs tires or you know, something.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's the kind of things that throw you off.
B:	Uh, uh, we do ours more monthly than long range.
B:	Uh, we, uh,
B:	my husband gets paid once a month
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And out of his check they take a savings
B:	and out of my check, they take savings and retirement both, out of both checks.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, his check, once a month, pays all the bills.
B:	My check, weekly, buys groceries and gas and you know, that kind of thing
A:	Oh, how nice.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it works out real well that way.
B:	We don't run into a lot of problems
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	but  budgets are horrible.
A:	Well,  I know.
A:	We do,
A:	my husband gets paid twice a week
A:	and so we pay all of the little bills, uh, one  paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill, you know, those big bills the second second pay
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, you know, for Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them, well send me some money
A:	Yeah,
A:	that kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	it, uh, it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
B:	but we do.
A:	But it's nice that it's there, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it,
B:	I'm just glad that it is there for car insurance, medical bills, whatever happens .
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's nice that it's there.
B:	I know.
B:	But I,
B:	you,
B:	it's just really is difficult.
B:	Uh, neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Groceries are outrageous
B:	and I keep saying my check does less and less
B:	but,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We bought more things
A:	and it seemed like we spent more.
A:	Then a lot of it was going to, uh, daycare and that kind of thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it just seems like with me staying home, we had that big cut
A:	but we save more
A:	I don't know how
A:	and I don't know why
A:	but we
B:	Well  I, uh, I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, uh well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that.
A:	it seems like we do.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you kind of try and buy bigger quantities.
B:	And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, uh, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, a lot, uh, better.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's how I felt too.
A:	It just,
A:	you could take a little longer. And  just watch a little bit more I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well,
A:	I guess that's kind of like the way we do.
A:	We,
A:	I, I don't, I don't know how it comes out.
A:	It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas,  where I was working,
B:	Well, I'm sure you do.
B:	Uh, I do not, well I do not have to pay child care during the winter.
B:	My son's old enough that he likes to come home uh, from school.
A:	Oh.
B:	But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So in the summer I have that extra
B:	and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that's usually movies one day, skating one day
A:	Yeah.
B:	Swimming one day
A:	It adds up.
B:	Yes.
B:	So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week
B:	and that's a lot of money.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is
A:	It is,
A:	yeah.
B:	But you know, if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	do you have two children?
A:	I have two.
A:	One is four and a half
A:	and the other one's two and a half,
A:	so.
B:	Well they're expensive too. Uh, just the  outgrowing of their clothes
A:	Yes
B:	so I'm sure the budget,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that,
A:	yeah.
A:	I just came back to find jeans for the little one
A:	and it does add up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh,
B:	And medical bill.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Although the insurance we had was good, uh, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
B:	and then you were reimbursed.
B:	So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the,  insurance,
B:	but in the meantime you had to put out the money first.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Well, that, that's, that's hard.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can
B:	Oh, I would too.
A:	For the,
B:	I would, I would advise anyone that could possibly do it to, to,
A:	I know it's not forever
A:	and that's what's so sad
A:	but,
B:	Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever.
B:	I don't know though
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	well, we just got our income tax return
A:	and I'm perfectly happy.
A:	What about you
B:	Well, let's see.
B:	I haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at, uh, at home in the Bay area.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I'm not sure how much I'm getting back
B:	but I'm pretty sure I should get back a little bit since student,
B:	so
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's not too much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Not too bad though
A:	But as far as writing checks out and paying taxes, I think it's pretty high.
A:	But I, I'm, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to, you know , pay taxes but, although it is kind of a pain sometimes though.
A:	How high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, that, that's, that's scary too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because it's not anything like the way it was when I was young and small and a child.
A:	So, you know, that, that's a scary part too, that you have to think about.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, and  like, as time goes on, you know, things get more expensive
B:	and because we were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more, uh, things get more expensive as well as more complex.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, everything from, you know, from medicare to, uh, to social security to, uh, to feeding the to, uh, to, you know, feeding the homeless, to maintaining prisons, to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that.
B:	And it's,
B:	now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing.
B:	And, you know it's, it's becoming a larger responsibility
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but someone has to pay for it
B:	and that's us.
A:	Yeah
A:	and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes, you know, taxpayers, are, is your money going to where you want it to go
A:	and. There's going to a special this week.
A:	I, I can't, I can't if it's TWENTY TWENTY or one of those things where,
A:	uh, I think it's one of the local news.
A:	I think they're having a documentary. Something about that.
A:	About their trying to catch some people that not spending your tax monies right and fraud and that kind of thing, you know
A:	and that's kind of scary too
B:	Uh-huh
A:	And, uh, so that would be interesting to see
A:	I wanted to see that program.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, and, even, even today it's like the amount of taxes that, you know, we're paying for.
B:	But you'd think that we're still in , that
B:	we're still not able to pay off things just because the budget's not big enough as it is.
A:	Oh, I know
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, makes you wonder when there's, you know, countries out there that have, you know, tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher.
B:	You know, it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that, that's kind of a scary thought.
B:	I hope it doesn't come down to that.
A:	Yeah
B:	But, on the other hand, they also, while those countries that have high taxes, also have things like, uh, socialized medicine, things like that too, which are nice fringe benefits of it.
B:	So everyone has, everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors. That sort of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's good
B:	but it's, it's the price they pay
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to be, uh, as far as cash flow, a lot, uh, have be, tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't generate a larger a, a large amount of revenue because there's so little, uh, currency flow through out the economic system
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well you sure do know a a lot
B:	Well, just keeping up with the times, that's all.
A:	Yeah
A:	yeah.
B:	As, as it turns out, you know, it's one of those, one of those interests , you know, I kind of like to keep up on.
B:	Because, well it's nice to know that when I'm actually, you know, I do start working that, I like to know where my tax dollars are going too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	work hard to get, you know.
B:	I like to know where it's going to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think about these items that are going to be, uh, taxed even more. Like, uh, tobacco and that kind of thing
B:	I think in a, in a way it's good, in a way it's not.
B:	Uh, but I think in general it's probably good.
B:	I mean, a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been, have been, in the past, uh, have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them, against  the taxes for them. Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's things like tobacco are, uh, they're, they're a proven health hazard to smokers  as well as nonsmokers
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	And it's,
B:	as far as the safety thing, in, like in San Luis Obispo, for example, there's an ordnance which states that, uh, there's no smoking in any public areas. *typo ordinance
B:	And so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere.
A:	Oh, really
A:	Okay
A:	Uh, I just currently quit my job
A:	and so I really don't receive any benefits right now
B:	Right
A:	But my husband does
A:	and, uh, I think one of the, uh, my,
A:	first of all, always salary and
A:	the second thing is, uh, because we have children,
A:	so it would be, uh, health benefits and medical benefits
A:	and and, uh, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Definitely.
A:	We have with Aetna
A:	and, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with them
A:	but we're real happy with them.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field.
B:	And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits.
B:	Uh, I've worked for, for for awhile
B:	and they are, you know, a really academic type of place.
B:	And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. And then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff.
B:	So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid
B:	and, you know, some have like bonuses
B:	and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits
B:	and so, yeah, I would
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids.
B:	Uh and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know. When we, when I think about changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of health care they have
A:	Yeah.
B:	and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially
B:	or how does that work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big one for me.  Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,
A:	Huh.
A:	Right.
B:	so that's not so bad, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.
B:	want to just, you know, all your salary can't even begin  to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know in a major illness or something. Uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And that really helped us out a great deal.
A:	So.
A:	But my husband does get vacation
A:	and it's worked out really good for us too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So
A:	But.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, cause that makes a big difference.
B:	My wife works part-time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
B:	and so two days a week, I, uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus
B:	So she you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon til close.
B:	Uh, so we have
A:	Well, that's great that you all can work that out.
A:	That's really good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and being on a, you know, rigid schedule wouldn't, there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.
A:	Right.
B:	And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school
B:	and you get home
B:	and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know.
B:	And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know.
B:	It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if, as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do .
A:	Worked out really well for us too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh. Well is there anything else that you look for
A:	or,
B:	Uh, a lot of I guess is.
A:	You've hit pretty,
A:	you've put a lot of the main points in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think some of, is how the, uh, you know,
B:	I guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Cause I've been, uh,
B:	especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems I've found out.
B:	I've worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, you know, type companies. And it, and especially if you're doing like professional work. Where you know, it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you're,
B:	like I've,
B:	I work with, uh, computer systems a lot.
B:	So it's kind of hard to say, you know.
B:	If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today
B:	and they were all straight
B:	and your building didn't fall down, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	you did a great job.
B:	But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers, you know.  Or do design studies or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's real hard to rate something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.
B:	It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know
B:	How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that does make a a person want to stay
A:	an interesting topic.
B:	Yes.
B:	The, uh, type of cars that I was, uh, I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, uh, Mazda Miata.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the, uh,
B:	I'm very much a, a fan of sports cars.
A:	Ah.
A:	Boy,  you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
B:	The,
B:	The, uh,
B:	uh, uh, though, actually, in
B:	actually if I
B:	I have
B:	I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time.
B:	I'd rather put my money into, uh, restoring my old cars.
B:	I have a old Triumph T R Six.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, so, uh,
B:	but if I was to buy one, probably something like a Miata.
B:	It's certainly,
B:	I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah
A:	What's the,
A:	how old is your car?
B:	Uh, well I have a, I have a nineteen eighty, uh, eighty-five C R X.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, which is, you know, it's,
B:	it still works fine
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	But it's, it's actually, it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it
A:	Oh.
B:	But, uh, Oh, those are,
A:	Yeah.
A:	So what do the Miatas run?
B:	they're about, uh, uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options and so on
B:	but  the,
A:	Well, that's not too bad.
B:	uh, yeah,
B:	that's a pretty good price
B:	and  they're, they're, they're, they're so nice to drive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Really?
A:	I've never driven one.
B:	Uh, uh, it's, it's, it's nice.
B:	They're,
B:	I've been down to a dealer and driven them.
B:	And I've also driven one at a, something Mazda put on where, uh, they went to, uh, autocross events across the country. Uh, which is where you race in, uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest.
A:	Huh?
B:	Uh, you know, about a minute or so. And, uh, very twisty stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And oh, it handles so nicely.
A:	And so you've done this?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh
B:	It was just,
B:	it, it's just so smooth
B:	and.
A:	Really?
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	Nice car.
B:	What are you interested in?
A:	Whatever my husband buys
B:	Yeah.
B:	You you don't get involved in, uh, car decisions?
A:	Oh, not too much.
A:	No.
A:	We, uh, we just got rid of a full conversion van that, that I, I, that wasn't me.
A:	That was my husband.
A:	He wanted a van
A:	and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there. T V, you know, the whole bit.
A:	But I never drove it
A:	so it just, it wasn't me, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I can understand.
A:	And then,  Oh, I'd want a minivan
B:	yeah.
B:	They're nice.
A:	Because I'm with the kids all the time.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's  perfect for that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And,
B:	It's not,
B:	it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You pick up  I pick up my little one from preschool
B:	Holds a lot.
A:	and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, you know, I, I drive a little Subaru.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, we, I love that.
A:	I,
A:	we were going to trade that in for the van
A:	but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Minivans are nice.
B:	I have a friend who has a minivan.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I've driven it a few times
B:	and, uh, it's nice,
B:	it's nice.
B:	Of course, you know, my my family has always had cars like that. Uh, in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a V W bus every since, uh nine, about nineteen sixty or so.
A:	Oh, really
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Uh, uh,
B:	they, well,
B:	he, he used it,
B:	he often has to transport plants or, uh, things  like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, you know, fills the car with plants. And so on
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, since, uh,
B:	well, I guess since this time last year I've changed, uh, jobs within the firm I'm with
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I now am learning to be a sys admin on, on, not only P C but, uh, uh, professional work stations as well.
A:	Wow.
A:	All right.
B:	And these are the big mamas, i. e. sons, uh, Hewlett Packards, uh uh, uh, oh, the big Solburns and, and so forth.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
B:	and, and, uh, we have, uh, two P C here.
B:	We have, uh, an X T
B:	and then recently we, we made a, the command decision to go ahead and get, uh, the absolute top of the line because spouse is a, uh, programmer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so we got one that,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	So, uh, I, I get to see all kinds of different applications.
A:	Sounds like you're an expert at it, too.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	Learning,
B:	I'm learning I'm learning to be, uh, one who knows what's he's doing
A:	Yes.
B:	but, expert,
B:	no
A:	Oh, well, well.
B:	I frown on that, that term because, uh, too many people, you know, uh, misuse the word
B:	but my area, my level of expertise is increasing almost daily.
A:	Well, that's great,
B:	And, uh, yeah,
B:	so, I've got a P C and a work station at work
B:	and I
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have two P C here at home.
A:	Right.
B:	And the,
B:	a lot of the, the, the new mama we're, uh,
B:	I've got Aldus and, uh, Micrographics on it as far as, uh, technical publishing
B:	and we do a, quite a bit of church work with ours.
A:	Great.
B:	And, uh,
A:	We do an awful lot of that, too with ours.
B:	You know, some,
B:	I, I, I've found that, uh, the more we do with it, uh,
B:	it seem,
B:	and the Lord's just pleased that we're kind of,
B:	this is, this is, part of giving back a portion of what He's given to us.
B:	So, uh, I don't mind, because seems like the more we do, there's, there's the more stuff that's, uh, available that comes along and so forth.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	And,
A:	Definitely agree with that.
B:	So, uh, rather than being niggardly and, and, chintzy, uh, we've just said, you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, uh, enabled us to get the money to buy the Four Eighty-Six.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because the top of the line we've got,
B:	well, we've got a compatible.
B:	It,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Wow,
A:	wow,
A:	you got,
A:	that's a Four Eighty-Six processor, too?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Wow
B:	Like I said
A:	That's,
A:	Yes.
A:	you have to have that to support UNIX.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	of RAM.
B:	and then, uh, it, it, it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive.
A:	Right
B:	So the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven
B:	and so rather than just have one, we went ahead and got two.
B:	Uh, at some point in time I'm going to do the mirroring, uh, experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for fault tolerance.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Wow,
A:	okay.
B:	And, uh, oh, speak, speak of the angel, she just walked in
A:	Well, good for her
B:	T I stuff another
B:	So, uh, uh,
A:	You say she's a programmer also.
B:	Yeah,
B:	she's, she's a squirrel for, uh, uh, contractor out at American Airlines.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
A:	Well, great.
A:	Well, she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work.
A:	Okay,
A:	you ready to discuss the, the topic?
B:	What's the topic?
A:	Okay,
A:	the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or thirty years ago.
B:	Okay.
A:	You ready for that?
B:	You bet.
A:	Okay
B:	I'll let you lead out.
A:	Pardon me?
B:	I'll let you lead out.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, there's, uh,
A:	it's kind of an interesting topic
A:	and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh,
A:	not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know,
A:	you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World,
A:	and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned,
A:	and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period.
A:	We're also have a very humongous trade deficit,
A:	and, uh, and that's kind of frightening.
A:	Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life,
A:	and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime,
A:	and so I think, uh, you know, things,
A:	there's been an awful lot of social change lately,
A:	and
A:	and, uh.
B:	I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the, they seem to be social, they seem to be economically driven also.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.
B:	And, of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now.
B:	One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.
A:	True.
B:	I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it must have been terribly boring to go through,  your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that, that aspects changing.
A:	True,
A:	true.
B:	And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good,
B:	but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, do, do you think that's good or bad?
B:	I think it's great.
A:	You think that's great.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's some,
A:	yeah,
A:	because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position,
A:	they, they're very comfortable,
A:	they lose the ability to learn,
A:	and they in a sense become unteachable.
A:	They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five,
A:	and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education,
A:	and, and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
B:	I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes.
B:	It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for, for people to face.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	I agree with that,
A:	I agree with that.
A:	But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn
B:	Yeah.
A:	learn how to adapt,
A:	learn how to grow in the, in their college or whatever education they might take.
A:	Well, that, that's good,
A:	that's good.
B:	There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.
B:	I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now
B:	and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place
A:	and it affects,
A:	Well, Nancy, what do you think, um, some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two?
B:	Well, of course, working.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's definitely got to be the biggest thing, is that everybody's out there working including me
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, what do you think it is?
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	I agree.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I also think that there are more, um,
A:	the people are,
A:	women stay single longer it seems like.
B:	Yes, they do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do.
A:	I know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty
B:	Right.
A:	and I waited until I was thirty-two,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know, um, I know that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	It's a big change.
B:	I'm an O B nurse
B:	and so I really do see what you're saying there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It used to be that our list ran nineteen, twenty, twenty-one for our patients' ages.
B:	And now our care plans look more like thirty-two, thirty-three
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if we get somebody twenty-one, we go, oh, look how young.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	you're right there's a big change,
B:	and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But again, I guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If they didn't have,
B:	if they weren't out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Seems like there's.
B:	I guess it's a combination.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	go ahead.
B:	No,
B:	go on.
A:	Uh, it just seems like there are more single mothers, too.
A:	I mean, that's,
A:	there're a lot of, either divorced or, um, you know, never been married,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	there's a lot of mixed up families, that's for sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	Well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so?
B:	Well, just that.
B:	I think the families,
B:	the, the role in the family,
B:	and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children, um,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we do it all
A:	Yeah.
B:	I really think that,
B:	and I know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers,
B:	but I still think the mothers have the major role.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really do.
B:	I think they're just, they're not doing very much less,
B:	I don't think as far as the kids and, and the house and everything are concerned, not from what I see
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and they're contributing to the income besides.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think that we're really, really putting a lot of stress on ourselves.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	and it really, it's affecting the families you know, for mothers not, not to be home, and yet, you know, um,
A:	I mean, I, I don't blame anybody when they have to work because, um,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's difficult,
B:	and I think that,
B:	I live in Plano actually,
B:	so
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's a very wealthy town,
B:	and we're not part of that,
B:	but, it is, you know,
B:	and, I think what I see a lot of parents, a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I really hate that you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I hate to see that,
B:	and I, I've been here for a very long time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um, I don't know,
B:	now I'm a single parent,
B:	and I don't have a choice any more
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I used to just work occasionally for extra money,
B:	but now I have to work all the time
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's really hard
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and I don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work, and, and leave the kids.
B:	In a way it's good, it's very good to get out with adults,
B:	and I think that's a good thing, if you can do it part time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But to just go out there forty hours a week, at least and and work and, and leave your kids to get home from school alone, and that kind of thing, I think that's not very smart.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think that's difficult on them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well what do you think's going to happen in the next generation?
A:	You think it'll continue?
B:	Well, it's going to be interesting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it will change,
B:	but I'm not sure how it's going to, because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know how they're going to do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again.
B:	I don't that ever will go backwards
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up, how they're going to feel about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It, you know, it could lead to another Woodstock type thing, you know, where where there's just too much material things,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's hard to say.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	I think some,
A:	I don't know how many, you know, what percentage, but some are, will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children.
A:	I guess I see that happening already.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some choosing it,
A:	and, and they get, you know,
A:	there're,
A:	people chide them for it, you know,
A:	why aren't you out,
A:	Okay.
A:	And, I've pressed the button.
B:	Okay.
B:	Let me tell you.
B:	I haven't been too many places
A:	You haven't been to too many places.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	I haven't.
A:	Well, okay.
A:	I have been to Hawaii.
B:	See now, that is where I want to go.
B:	That is where I have always wanted to go.
B:	I have never been there.
A:	It is beautiful.
B:	I know.
B:	Is it, is it, uh,
B:	I had an aunt that lived there
B:	and she couldn't stand it any more.
B:	She moved out because she said the whole island was, uh, you know being taken over by the Japanese.
A:	Well, there is, there is a lot of Japanese over there.
A:	And they are,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and she, uh, also told me that,
B:	well not her, uh, necessarily, other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is it?
A:	Uh, well, yeah.
A:	There is,
A:	it is commercialized.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sure.
A:	I don't think I have enough,
A:	Oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, it is still beautiful.
A:	You have got to see at least once.
B:	Oh, well I will. You know,
B:	eventually
A:	So,
B:	Well, what is the most, uh, you know the nicest island?
A:	Uh, I like Maui.
B:	Maui.
B:	I think that is what usually people, uh say they do, they like the best.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I like it because the beach is nice and white
A:	and you know it is like Oahu,
A:	you can go over there and lay on the beach
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, Kauai,
A:	I mean, the beaches are nice,
A:	but I don't know, just not nice as Maui.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then, uh, where, where have you been?
B:	Well, I have been to California.
B:	I've been to San Francisco.
A:	Oh you have?
B:	I loved it.
B:	I absolutely loved it.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh,
A:	How long ago?
B:	Oh, uh, eighty-six.
A:	Huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	My sister lives out there
B:	My sister lives in Piedmont.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Oh, well that is right near Piedmont.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is like a suburb or something, whatever.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well she was in Berkley also
B:	and she
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	lets see I went when she was, uh, was living,
B:	well when I went out there she was in, uh, now I can't, oh, Lafayette.
B:	She was living in Lafayette.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	right.
B:	And then they moved to Piedmont.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I, uh, I haven't seen, uh, you know, her house in Piedmont
B:	but, but I loved San Francisco.
B:	I would like to go back.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Did you go on the cable cars and everything?
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Isn't that fun?
B:	Went to Alcatraz.
B:	You know we did the whole bit.
B:	And then we went to the wine country.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Up by Napa.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, beautiful.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we went to Carmel.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we took the eighteen mile drive.
A:	Isn't that pretty.
A:	I love it down there.
B:	Oh, it is beautiful.
B:	That is really beautiful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My girlfriend was down there a few months ago.
B:	First time she has been down there
B:	and they wanted to take that drive
B:	and they had closed the whole road because of, uh, uh, fog,
A:	Oh, the weather.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So they never got to do that.
A:	Huh.
A:	Well I have also been to the Carribean.
B:	Oh, I haven't been there either
B:	You name it, I haven't been there
A:	Well I, uh, have been there a couple of times.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I went on a cruise.
B:	Oh, that is nice.
A:	The last time I went, I went with my two sisters.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it was over Christmas time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we really had a good time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well they, they had this cruise director dress up like Santa Claus,
A:	and we went to the beach
A:	and they had put a Christmas tree on the beach decorated it up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was, it was a lot of fun.
B:	Well, that's nice.
A:	So.
B:	Is, uh, a cruise nicer than, uh, if you just go, on a regular, uh, you know, to a hotel?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It is.
B:	I have heard it is.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know.
A:	You put your clothes in your room,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, you will have to go on one.
B:	You don't get seasick?
B:	That is what I am afraid of.
A:	No.
B:	No,
B:	huh.
A:	I mean there was,
A:	some people did, uh, on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but that is unusual.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, one of my sisters got sick,
A:	but the other one didn't
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, it is really nice
A:	and they, they just do so many things for you, you know, to make you enjoy the trip and everything.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, you will have to do that once.
A:	I want to go on another one,
A:	but I want to go to Alaska.
B:	Oh, yes.
B:	Now someone I know was on a cruise to Alaska.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Was it to Alaska?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I am pretty sure.
B:	That is right my hairdresser
A:	Oh, really?
B:	She went last year.
B:	She said she went on a cruise.
B:	And I was thinking, you know, cruise I am thinking.
B:	So on
B:	and she is laying on the beach.
B:	And I said, well you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise
B:	She said we went to Alaska
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, that, that I would like to go,
B:	well Hawaii is my, uh, is number one.
B:	I would also like to go to Australia
B:	and get a,
A:	Oh, I think I would like to, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I keep hoping to win the lottery where I can do all these things. You know.
B:	Oh, well see, I am, am just in the Publisher's Clearing House and the READER'S DIGEST, because we don't, uh,
B:	right now the lottery here,
A:	Okay. Well, what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody?
A:	I think they should.
A:	I know I had a job until, let's see, a year ago this past December.
A:	I was working for P I E
A:	and they closed,
A:	and naturally while I was working for them I had health insurance,
A:	but, um, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at, at P I E.
B:	Good grief.
B:	That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it?
A:	Right,
A:	it really is,
A:	and I think, you know, I think, uh,
A:	God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.
B:	Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, uh, interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that.
B:	That might be a step in the right direction.
B:	I don't know.
A:	Well, the thing is, you know, jobs are so hard to find you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	anyhow in the valley where I live at now, they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all.
A:	No benefits, you know. Um.
B:	You mean the, uh, the employers?
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low
A:	and, uh.
B:	Because everybody's competing for jobs.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they don't want, uh,  to pay any benefits,
A:	so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get sick.
B:	Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.
B:	I, I have to think about it some more now, because my doctor is, uh, actually he's Canadian
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, he told me that there're a lot of, uh, lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't understand the arguments, exactly.
B:	He says it restricts your choice of doctors, and, and so forth.
B:	I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does.
A:	No,
A:	I don't understand  that either.
B:	I mean  we're on a private insurance plan right now, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	actually I have my own business,
B:	and and we,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	our health insurance is through my wife's employer,
B:	and, uh, and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can buy our medicine,
B:	and, uh, it changes every year
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's always so confusing.
B:	So.
A:	Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor
A:	and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, you know,
A:	then I just sent cards in
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine,
A:	and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, you know.
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the, uh, the limits of, uh, compensation,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but of course that is restricted choice,
B:	so I don't think that the restricted choice really, uh, has to do with the difference between, uh, public and private health insurance.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I think it has to do with the, the, the, uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it
A:	Um.
B:	and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true,
A:	that's true there.
A:	Well.
B:	You, you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and, uh, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, uh, lavish.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh.
A:	But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything, you know,
A:	that,
A:	people that's on unemployment.
B:	Yeah,
B:	what happened to Reagan's safety net, anyway?
A:	I don't
B:	Did he take that back to California with him?
B:	Using it for a trampoline now?
A:	Yeah,
A:	probably so.
A:	I don't know,
A:	but it is, it does seem to be a big problem, you know.
A:	I don't know what they're going to come up with,
A:	but, um, I sure wish they would come up with, with something,
A:	and, uh, like I say,
A:	and, and I'm at the age, too, where the,
A:	I'll be fifty-seven in June,
A:	and the people don't want to hire people this age any more.
A:	And I worked for my previous company for twenty-six years, you know,
A:	so, it's kind of hard, you know,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they'll be needing you in a couple of years, because they're running out of kids down that, the other end.
B:	And.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they'll be calling at my door, huh.
A:	But anyhow.
B:	Well, if they're smart.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, uh, with this problem, because, it, you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to ask him anything, costs you forty bucks you know, just for the visit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then he,
A:	then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, you know.
A:	And he might tell you, well, you know, now you're going to have to come back in a week,
A:	and then that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you,
B:	Right.
A:	Okay, Bill, um,
A:	as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now,
A:	who do you work with at this time?
B:	Well, I own the company.
A:	You own the company.
A:	All right.
B:	I'm the president and C E O of the company.
A:	My goodness.
B:	So, uh, I guess, uh, I determine what the benefits are
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess you do.
B:	But, uh, so what are you asking me,
B:	what, what benefits I think are most important?
A:	Well, what, what do you think of the,
A:	let's put it this way,
A:	what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, other than, other than their present salary?
B:	Um, I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, uh, such as, um, health insurance and life insurance and the, some type of retirement plan I'd say that, uh, most of the employees, uh, um, that we have really like a, a profit sharing plan.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	A profit sharing plan,
A:	that's interesting,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, you know,
B:	because they feel like, well, we're contributing to it,
B:	so we'd like to participate in it,
B:	and so that means I make a little bit less,
B:	but the thing is that really you make a little more, because everybody has a interest in, in it working.
A:	Yes,
A:	because they they have a specific reason to do so, because they themselves benefit from doing a better job.
B:	Right.
B:	I think most people, uh, don't want money, um,
B:	it's been my experience, most people want, uh, to feel like they're participating in something that, uh, that is not a drudgery, you know, that they  enjoy, and that they can get some benefits out of.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	And it's a contribution.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, Bill, uh, that idea fits me exactly.
A:	I just retired from, uh, the university here,
A:	and that's been the goal in my life, was to contribute and, to the work that I was doing in my research,
A:	and that's what made me happy,
A:	and, uh, that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for,
A:	and I'm sure a lot of them don't.
A:	You can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, uh, our people get a lot of satisfaction.
B:	Um, we're a financial planning firm.
A:	You're a financial planning firm?
B:	Yes.
A:	How many, uh.
B:	You said you retired,
B:	I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning,
B:	but  anyway, uh, uh, we do, we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well.
B:	and, uh, it's real important, uh, that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that, where they were, that, uh, uh, that it take care of them.
B:	They don't,
B:	none of them really want to be rich,
B:	but they like to have enough to be comfortable.
A:	Well, what, what changes would you, have you considered, uh, in doing it, to, to your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better?
B:	Well, um, we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a, a salary is, uh, is tie, um, uh, a percentage, um of business that, uh, that a person would participate and bring into the company.
B:	Uh, pay them, uh, based on the percentage of business they bring, instead of based on their salary.
B:	And the
A:	When you say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people to, to come in and, uh, ask for your support?
B:	No,
B:	not necessarily.
B:	Um, it can be in-house people who help you handle X amount of dollars.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.
B:	Right
B:	well see, we have we have marketing people,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then we have financial planners,
B:	and, uh, then we have, uh, staff secretaries and administrative assistants,
B:	and these secretaries and administrative assistants, um, you know, if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company, they, they can get very dissatisfied very quickly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, so, uh, we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle.
B:	So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Yes,
A:	but it, it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job,
A:	but it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind of support.
B:	Well, and, and, but to,
B:	see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to that, you know, that they work together with it encourages them not to, uh, complain when they realize that they get a part of the, of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying, well make me do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	See, we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.
B:	I don't think any
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think most people want to be, lack of better terminology, they want to be self-employed,
B:	but they don't want to take the risk.
B:	In other words, they like to control their own future,
B:	but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence,
A:	That's true.
B:	which,
B:	that's what we have.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Actually, I'm in,
B:	like I said, I'm in Minneapolis
B:	and the big thing up here, of course, is the twins. Uh,
A:	I imagine you can't escape it
B:	No,
B:	it's, it's pretty pervasive.
B:	It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here.
B:	But, uh, actually, I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year,
B:	but that was a lot of fun .
A:	Well, of course, it was fun for you
B:	Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.
B:	In fact, I've only been up here a few months
B:	and I'm going back at the end of next month.
A:	To?
B:	Uh, Orlando, Florida.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.
B:	But,
A:	I was born and raised in, uh, near Miami and, uh, spent the  last twenty years in Dallas uh, where the Rangers played.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, for the  last, uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A and the San Francisco Giants.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, but honestly, you know, I, uh, I do my duty and watch the sports on, uh,  the newscasts
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I haven't followed it real closely at all. Uh, except like I said, last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that pretty religiously.
B:	Went out into the bars, you know drank a beer, watched the game, had a a good time that way.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	sure.
B:	But, uh,
A:	Well, I guess the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A were like the leading teams a couple of years ago.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Well, I
A:	well I don't know.
A:	That's sort of what I gather.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and, uh, I don't know.
A:	What is the prognosis for, uh, this year?
B:	Uh, real good as far as I can tell.
B:	People are pretty excited about it.
A:	Good.
A:	I, I assume that means good for the Minnesota
B:	Well yeah
B:	Sorry about that,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good.
B:	Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
B:	and they, they won that one seven to one,
B:	so, uh, that's pretty good I guess.
B:	It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.
B:	Are you still there?
A:	Yep
B:	Okay.
B:	I heard some noise on the line.
B:	Didn't know what happened.
A:	I think a train went by.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	All right.
A:	I know a train went by,
A:	I don't know what the noise was
A:	but I think it probably was the, the train.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	I, I, I don't even know, uh, who has been winning in, uh, as far as the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A
A:	but I think they both won their opener.
A:	I, uh, sort of gathered that in my, uh, subliminal memory.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, uh, for their season coming up.
B:	I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now.
B:	Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, uh, an internship.
B:	We, we're both doctoral students
B:	and he's  doing his with I B M
A:	Huh.
B:	and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.
B:	But, uh, I, I think he kind of follows the sports
B:	and I think he's mentioned uh, the Oakland A a couple of times.
B:	Uh  he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess they are different leagues.
A:	Is that right?
A:	The A
B:	As far as I know,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah .
B:	And in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions
B:	and then, of course, there's the minors.
B:	Uh, I don't know.
B:	I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,
B:	and he offered, you know, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought, uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, or a row of seats actually, for the home games.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.
B:	So there's no, no way that you can ever use them all.
A:	Eighty-six?
B:	Eighty-six.
B:	I was amazed to hear that.
A:	Huh!
B:	You know, that's just the home games
B:	and I, I thought it was a mistake
B:	but he goes no .
A:	Well they must play every day then.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well just about,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And that's, you know,
B:	yeah
B:	that's almost,
A:	And that's, Lord, that's, uh, over five months worth.
B:	That's a lot of baseball.
A:	Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.
B:	Well, you, if you, if you consider it, the season starts,
B:	well it's,
B:	the season started about a week and a half ago
B:	and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.
A:	No.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think so.
B:	It did last year, didn't it?
B:	Or was it November?
A:	That was the Super Bowl.
B:	Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.
B:	I know it was doggone cold up here. Uh,
A:	I don't feel so bad.
A:	I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball
B:	Well, I know for sure it was,
A:	I see,
A:	okay.
B:	And, and it was at least two months after I got up here.
A:	Oh, really,
A:	okay .
B:	Yeah,
B:	so it had to be November anyway.
A:	Well, I, I know, uh, the Super Bowl,
A:	Okay.
A:	What would you rather have?
A:	Or you want salary too plus what?
A:	What's most important to you?
B:	Well, as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, uh, health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern.
A:	Right.
B:	I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans, uh, goes a long way toward satisfying my needs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I'll tell you.
A:	I think that is the most important thing
A:	I've, uh, I'm not working right at the moment
A:	but the company that I did work for
A:	excuse me I had health benefits. You know, dental, vision, all that, pension plan, uh,
A:	now I don't have that, although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which, thank God, I had.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, man, I think those medical benefits are the most important. Uh,
B:	You, you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical
B:	and, uh, you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your, your compensation package.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh, I should knock on wood.
A:	I haven't, you know, had any serious health problems or anything.
A:	I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I left work
A:	and it was only for a cold, you know,
A:	and they can't really do anything for you anyhow,
A:	so you might as well not even go
B:	Yeah,
B:	they look at you, say, well you're still breathing, so, uh,  Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right
A:	Oh, you've got a cold.
A:	Go home and take, uh, liquids and, uh, rest.
A:	But,
A:	uh, that is definitely, the most important.
A:	Uh, pension, I guess, is next.
A:	Uh, thank God that I had one.
A:	I don't know what happened to the salary employees when, uh, the company went bankrupt
A:	but I was union,
A:	so mine was being put into a, like a trust fund, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	So, but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs
A:	or,
B:	I suspect that it just disappeared.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what I was thinking too.
A:	I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	So where,
A:	what company do you work for?
B:	Uh, I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark. Uh,
A:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	Have you heard of them?
A:	No.
B:	They,
B:	we do, uh, distributive system software for Unix based workstations
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	No,
A:	I, I worked for a trucking company P I E, nation wide.
A:	You probably heard of that
B:	Ah, yes,
B:	yes.
B:	In fact, my mom drives trucks
B:	so,
A:	Oh, does she really?
B:	Yes.
A:	Oh, how about that.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	I see, uh,
B:	after the merger, uh, you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road.
A:	Well, you did.
B:	So, did, did Ryder get out of the business?
B:	Is that what happened or?
A:	Well Ryder and P I E went together  you know,
B:	Right.
A:	and then, then that ended it
B:	Huh.
B:	So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing.
A:	It really did.
A:	It's, it started, I think, a little bit before that
A:	but that,
A:	when P I E and, and Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and the, the problem with that is, you know, when you leave a job, you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time.
A:	Right.
B:	But when, when the company goes bankrupt, I mean, the, they're just cut off completely
B:	and you're responsible for your own.
A:	Right.
B:	And, and that's exceedingly expensive.
A:	Yes,
A:	it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits.
A:	We could do that for eighteen months.
B:	Right.
A:	But three hundred and fifty dollars a month.
B:	It's definitely excessive.
A:	So, but anyhow, uh, and jobs aren't that hard to find, to get another one that does pay your benefits, you know.
B:	True.
A:	And a lot of them that,
A:	if you do get a job, they don't pay benefits.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're starting to, to cut back. Especially start-ups.
B:	I know here at Trans Ark, we get, uh, we get health care
B:	and that's it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, there's no dental or vision.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the, the short-term disability policy is, is a ninety day policy
B:	and there is no long-term disability policy.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, you know, at least in the case of this particular company, they tend to scrimp a little bit there.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, of course, they can use the excuse
B:	well, we're start-up.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right
A:	But you know what's happening is the, disability plan, you know,
A:	so many people are lying about their things.
A:	God, there's been big articles in the paper about that.
A:	Uh, you know, they claim a back injury
A:	and then someone goes out and spies on them
A:	and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen.
A:	But, uh
B:	Well that certainly doesn't help matters any.
B:	I mean, you, you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you, you know, these additional benefits,
A:	You want to go first
B:	Well, uh, no
B:	I I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or as I would like to, uh, uh, these days.
B:	I,
B:	seems to be to easy to get busy with other things.
B:	Uh, I have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run,
B:	and every, every January and every September, I start out again
B:	and then it tapers off
A:	Really?
B:	Uh, what about you?
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I do a lot of exercise.
A:	Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which I absolutely love.
A:	Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years
A:	and I wanted to get it back off
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was going through a divorce
A:	and I just found that running really made me feel good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Got out a lot of aggression.
A:	I went to the gym every day
A:	and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike
A:	and, uh, I felt really good.
A:	I needed to do it
A:	and it was really helpful at the time.
A:	Now when I do those things, they're boring.
A:	I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago.
A:	And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it
A:	and I'm just feeling really good.
A:	I love the class,
A:	it's real challenging,
A:	so I'm really into that,
A:	I really like that a lot.
B:	Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,
A:	It is, it's aerobics
A:	but it's with dance steps.
B:	Okay.
A:	It's an aerobic exercise
A:	and it's an hour straight.
A:	And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and I'm, I'm getting much better.
A:	My stamina is getting great for the dance floor
A:	so  I mean it's just,
B:	Yeah.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it,
A:	so.
B:	Well, uh, okay.
B:	Now that's inside again,
B:	right?
A:	It is inside
A:	and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
B:	But,
A:	and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
B:	Do, do you like to do it with other people.
B:	I mean like the, the jazzercise would be?
A:	I have a thirteen year old daughter
A:	and so we go bike riding
A:	and it's nice.
A:	We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I've enjoyed that part of it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And at the gym, even in the class, uh, I,
A:	it's not really a group where you chat a lot.
A:	Everybody's on their way to someplace
B:	Right.
A:	and so, you know, I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
B:	But,
A:	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	Right.
B:	But still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.
A:	There are, there are.
A:	It's more motivating that way, I think.
A:	Yeah.
B:	In terms of motivation and incentive,
B:	yeah.
A:	You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V
A:	but
A:	you probably wouldn't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I've,
B:	one thing,
B:	when, when I have run and jogged, uh,
B:	I've always enjoyed doing it by myself
B:	and, and,
B:	not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do,
B:	I, I've really enjoyed just the activity
B:	and, uh, I write software, uh, as far as the job
B:	and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out.
B:	The,
B:	it's
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I can see it'll be a good break.
B:	The the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
A:	Right.
B:	and I find that I can often, you know,
B:	often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working
B:	and I, I go back
B:	and I've got new ideas,
B:	but still .
A:	I think you do.
A:	You feel very good after you exercise.
A:	I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You owe it to yourself
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better
A:	and it's just, uh,
A:	I think it's well worth it.
A:	I just demand that time for myself.
A:	Now I've learned to do that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself.
B:	That you've just got to   you've just got to
A:	You have to.
A:	Because   there's always more things to do.
B:	Right.
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it
A:	but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself
A:	and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I take it
A:	so.
B:	Well good,
B:	well good.
B:	Well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging?
B:	I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, uh, club.
A:	No,
A:	I've done some walking with friends in the past.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's not really beneficial,
A:	so, uh I don't have time like that
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, read any good books lately?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I, I've read, uh, several good books lately.
B:	Uh, lot of them related to, uh, business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Uh, well I'm in graduate school
A:	and so I read a lot of books
A:	but I don't know if I consider very many of them good
A:	Uh, I haven't read a book for enjoyment since, I guess, around Christmas.
A:	Uh, I received, uh, uh, several books for Christmas
A:	and at Christmas break I read, uh, SARUM by, uh, uh, a fellow named Rutherford.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, it's the history of, uh,
A:	well it's sort of the the historical fiction about, uh, the Salisbury area in, in England.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, I, I really enjoyed that book a lot.
A:	Uh, he's not quite as good as, you know, Michener or some of, uh, some of the other historical writers.
A:	But he, he did this job well,
A:	so.
B:	Well, that sounds good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, do you find do you find you have much chance to read for, for just pleasure or mostly for business?
B:	No,
B:	I read for pleasure some also.
B:	I read a book recently called IRON JOHN.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you seen that by Bly?
A:	I don't think I have seen it.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well it's a book about, uh, uh, Greek gods and, and Greek, uh, mythology as well as, uh, man and interacting with other men and a book about, uh, men and how they mature through life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	And how they deal with life itself
A:	Okay.
A:	I think I have heard about that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that sounds great.
A:	Did, did it have something to mention about, uh, sort of, uh, cultural rituals of, of manhood?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have heard of that.
A:	I have, uh, someone suggested that I read it.
A:	Is it IRON JOHN?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	Good.
B:	By Bly,
B:	B L Y, I believe it is.
A:	B L Y?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
A:	Great.
B:	And, uh, it's a very interesting book.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, what are your favorite, uh,
A:	do you have a favorite subject to read, whether it be science fiction or, or history
A:	or,
B:	Well, it depends again if we're talking about uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I read a lot of books in the area of, uh, uh, psychology and self-help type, uh, materials.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh, always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, uh, so that, that's,
B:	my work is my hobby
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That  sounds great
B:	So I, I enjoy it.
A:	Uh, who is your, whose your favorite religious author?
B:	Well, I don't know if I have a favorite uh, religious author.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I would have to say that, uh, some of the ones that consistently put out good materials, uh, you know,
B:	that, that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I had to stop here and think a second.
B:	One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books
B:	and I thought that each one of his books were good.
B:	He's the man out of San Antonio.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Max Lucado?
B:	Max Lucado.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Max consistently writes good books.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, he's a great man.
A:	I've met him several times. Uh,
B:	Yes.
B:	I know him,
B:	yeah.
A:	Huh.
B:	But  uh, there's other authors also that have uh, uh, that write good books from time to time, but not consistently put out the materials all the time
B:	Uh, I'd say another, which is a local writer here in Plano, uh, is, uh,
B:	I'm trying to think of his name.
B:	He's with the Bible church.
B:	And that is, uh,
B:	I see his name
B:	but I can't,
B:	I mean I see him
B:	but I can't see his name
B:	But he, uh, he talks about, uh, he talks about a lot of different topics
B:	and,
A:	Okay,
A:	I guess its recording.
A:	Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?
A:	Do you sing or knit or anything?
B:	Well, I, um, I do cross-stitch
B:	and I enjoy reading and playing softball.
A:	Okay.
A:	I, uh, I started knitting awhile ago,
A:	I knitted
A:	I didn't know, even know what the stitch is called.
A:	I just had this, uh, uh, piece of yarn
A:	and I wanted to start something
A:	so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old
A:	So I kept doing that,
A:	and now I have a little blanket
A:	but that's all I've done.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, um, made a few things
B:	but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
A:	Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?
B:	Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,
B:	you could make the, like the granny squares or whatever, and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	I see.
B:	Nothing as big as a blanket.
A:	Huh.
B:	I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff
B:	but,
A:	I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket
A:	I don't know why.
A:	It's just too time consuming.
B:	Yeah,
B:	do you have any other hobbies?
A:	Um, I like to sing.
A:	I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that.
B:	Oh, well that's good.
A:	Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter.
A:	But, uh, if I could do anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally.
A:	But um,
B:	So are you on the T V then?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	I'm in, uh,
A:	I work for channel six in Waco.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And so I do little news reports and things.
A:	It's not as exciting as it as it sounds.
A:	But, um,
B:	So you don't have too much time for hobbies?
A:	No,
A:	not much,
A:	um, my day is usually pretty full.
B:	Yeah.
A:	My schedule is like from nine to five thirty,
A:	but I could be at work from anytime, you know, from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever,
A:	so it's hard to make plans much less, you know, have a hobby.
B:	Yeah
A:	so. What do you do?
B:	Um.
A:	Normally.
B:	I'm a housewife.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either
A:	Uh-huh
B:	But I've made a, um, few things, cross-stitch things.
B:	I really enjoy doing that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And um, I made, uh, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that, type of thing,
A:	Oh.
B:	and it just takes a long time to get it done
B:	but, you know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to, to see it.
A:	Right.
A:	I I showed mine to my boyfriend
A:	and he was like, you didn't make that.
B:	Really?
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it looks, uh, halfway decent
A:	actually, first thing I did
B:	I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long
A:	How many children do you have?
B:	Two.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	I hear them in the background there .
B:	Yeah
A:	All right,
A:	that's a hobby in itself.
B:	Not quite
A:	A job in itself.
B:	It's a fulltime job,
B:	yeah.
A:	Right now I was just sitting here watching T V,
A:	I was getting ready to fall asleep.
B:	So, um, have you sang at any weddings yet?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I sang at one last summer.
A:	Um, it was my first wedding.
A:	I've done, um, little commercials and background singing
A:	and, um, I sang all through college and things like that
A:	but I really haven't done anything really, professional per se.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I did one wedding last year
A:	and, uh, I just now got some cards together, kind of, uh, business cards that say, singer,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or something,
A:	and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops,
A:	I mean when someone comes in, you know, for a wedding, for a wedding dress, and they, they might ask about it.
B:	Oh, that's a good place,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, you know, if any one wants to listen.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, she wanted me to bring it in,
A:	she's going to play it on Saturday
A:	so that would be great, if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice,
B:	Yeah
A:	but, I haven't got any calls, yet
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	but I only just put them out this week
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it's the wedding season, I guess.
B:	Oh, that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would be great.
A:	Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.
B:	Yeah
A:	Not that I don't like reporting,
A:	but, I'd love it.
B:	Did you have training in singing when you were, younger then
B:	or,
A:	No,
A:	I've never, I've never had, uh, formal training.
A:	I've just been singing every chance I get.
A:	I try, you know, in school
B:	Choirs and that kind of stuff?
A:	and, yeah,
A:	choirs
A:	and, um, when I was at U T, I was in a group called Ensemble One oh Nine, just twelve singers
A:	and we did, uh, little conventions and, um, uh, like dinner parties and things like that.
B:	Huh.
A:	Sing pop music.
B:	Well, that's nice.
A:	So, that's what got me really, really interested in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	not just give up your job and jump right into it
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
A:	My parents would have a fit probably.
A:	But, uh, I think,
A:	I either have a call or,
A:	yeah,
A:	I do have a call,
A:	hold on one second.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Hello.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	okay
A:	that's my mother on the other line,
A:	I need to go,
B:	Oh.
A:	but, um, I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes
A:	are we suppose to hear a beep or anything?
B:	I don't know,
B:	I've only done this one other time
B:	and I thought that the man told me five minutes.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	my mother said ten minutes
A:	so, I don't know.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But, uh, okay
A:	well, it was nice talking to you
A:	and,  and good luck with your hobbies
B:	It was nice talking to you, too,
B:	good luck with your singing.
B:	Okay,
B:	bye.
A:	Thanks,
A:	bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, you want to start by telling me what camping is to you.
A:	Do you backpack or hike
A:	or,
B:	Well, uh, a little bit, uh,
B:	nothing overly strenuous.
B:	No,
B:	the majority of my camping experience is, uh, a tent by the lake type situation or, uh, maybe a canoe trip or something like that.
A:	No,
A:	I've never done a canoe trip.
A:	That sounds interesting.
B:	Oh, it, it's,
B:	we've had a lot of fun, uh,
B:	I, I moved to Dallas about five years ago
B:	and we've made three different trips since I've been here. The group of friends that I run around with, of varying degrees, uh, of difficulty.
B:	The, the last one we did, and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was, uh, was a canoe trip in Arkansas
B:	and the river was, it was up about three feet
B:	so it was, uh, it was it was pretty challenging.
A:	Oh, man, I imagine.
B:	But, uh, and then we, uh,
B:	as far as the camping part of that, we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and, uh, find, uh, find a clearing in the woods and go for it.
A:	So they'll actually fit in the canoe
A:	and then you go for days at a time.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's the,
B:	that, that particular one was a two day trip
B:	so what, uh,
B:	there's, uh, there's a outfitter
B:	and, uh, they haul you up to the headwaters, come down about halfway and then you get to, you spend the night
B:	and then, uh, the second day head on down to the, to the pool at the end of the river.
A:	God, that sounds like fun
B:	Yeah
B:	it, it really is.
A:	Well the camping I grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type.
A:	And, uh, you know, that just either out in the woods, or
A:	actually I, I grew up water skiing.
A:	I was, uh, from California,
B:	Okay.
A:	and so we would go up to the Sacramento, uh, river sloughs, the delta there,
B:	Okay.
A:	and you just pick a campground on the river,
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	cooled off,
A:	but, uh, when I got married, my husband had always backpacked.
B:	Okay.
A:	And so we did that, uh,
A:	I guess we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago.
A:	And that was a new experience for me
A:	but I enjoyed it.
A:	I like being able to go back into the mountains, or, you know, where the trail didn't necessarily lead, and where you couldn't necessarily, pitch a tent
B:	Boy, I bet,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, that, that was interesting.
A:	I, I have always wanted to do some white water rafting
A:	and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that was, uh, that's always been our next step.
B:	Our, our little group of friends here, we've been kind of getting married off and what not
B:	but, uh,
A:	Don't let that stop you
B:	Yeah,
B:	that,
B:	well, it, it just puts a damper on things for a little while.
A:	I know.
B:	But we're, we're starting to get everybody back together.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we'd like to do a float trip down, uh, oh, like Big Bend area or something like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so you haven't done that before.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	we haven't made that trip yet.
A:	My parents, uh, were sailing, uh, this last year down off, uh, Costa Rica
A:	and they took about two weeks and went into,
A:	I don't even know the name of the river there,
A:	but they went white water rafting
A:	and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience.
A:	She said it was truly incredible.
B:	I'll bet,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, you know, I,
A:	there's that sense of it, you know, you're kind of scared, that risk of like gosh, what could happen and then the thrill of, you know, the excitement of doing it,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	Well, do you have anything planned for this summer?
B:	Um, not really just yet.
B:	We've, uh,
B:	well I, I do have, uh, a little bit of property,
B:	I grew up in South Dakota,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet.
B:	There's, uh, there's a little lake up there
B:	and, uh, a group of friends that I, I went to college with, um, got together
B:	and we basically own all the land around this little lake, there,
B:	it's divided up into ten lots.
A:	Oh, I imagine.
B:	So, we've got a private lake,
B:	and it's completely undeveloped at this point,
B:	so, that's a possibility.
B:	And the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime.
B:	It, it's, it's about two hours north of Minneapolis.
A:	Oh that doesn't, that sounds good.
B:	So, uh, yeah,
B:	in fact, uh, uh,
B:	well I got married last summer
B:	and, uh, that's, that's,
B:	we ended up there for a couple days, uh, on our honeymoon.
B:	We kind of took, uh, a tour of the United States for about a week, and, uh, up through that area.
A:	That sounds,
B:	But, uh, my wife's real excited about it,
B:	so, we're, uh, we're going to hope to get up there sometime early
B:	last year it was the end of July
B:	and it was a little too late for the fish
B:	but, uh, hopefully get up there early enough to, to get into some of the, some of the fish and, uh, the, the good weather and what not.
A:	We've been wanting to start camping again this year too.
A:	Uh, my oldest child is a girl, was born three years ago, three and a half.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then I have a little one that just turned two
A:	and we are in the process of potty training.
A:	I didn't want to go camping with diapers, you know.
B:	Oh gosh,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I,
A:	and, and, you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is, you know, some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent,
A:	they'd be awake all night.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, but I think with him almost potty trained and, you know, she's not afraid of her shadow anymore, that I'm, I'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go, uh, this summer, you know, even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days, or something to get them used to it and get them started, uh, with little back packs of their own, and, you know, things like that.
B:	Sure.
B:	Right.
B:	You bet,
B:	yeah,
B:	we'll that, you know
B:	and there's a lot of places with, uh, like nature trails, things like that where they could learn a lot, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that's true.
B:	You know, it's like, okay, this, this is, this is what, uh, a pheasant looks like, you know,
B:	and okay, now we'll go look for one.
A:	Ugh, I would need that before I could teach them
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	that's,
B:	everybody might learn something that way,
B:	but, uh, but yeah
B:	that's,
B:	there is, there's an awful lot of things set up, you know, just any, anything you want to do.
B:	Like, like you say it can be, uh, a water ski trip, or fishing trip or just a sightseeing, bird watching, you know, hunt, hunt with a camera type of thing
B:	or, there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that.
B:	It's a lot of fun,
B:	it really is.
B:	Hello.
A:	I've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this.
A:	It's been down this weekend.
B:	V in Well, I haven't tried,
B:	but this is,
B:	I haven't called in a couple of days,
B:	but education in public schools.
B:	I have a son who's graduating, uh, in May,
B:	and there's some interesting problems of, of, of how you, how do you challenge the kids today.
B:	And I have some real hang-ups.
B:	I think that, uh, if your, if your kid's not ambitious, he can sure get lost.
A:	In the school systems?
B:	Yes.
A:	That's right.
A:	What school system does he go to?
B:	In North Garland,
B:	he goes
A:	Okay.
B:	What school system are you familiar with?
A:	Okay,
A:	my children go to Garland,
A:	and I teach in Dallas.
B:	oh,
B:	okay,
B:	well, I have a daughter that's in the, in,  in the I B program at Garland.
B:	In the,
B:	are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, do your kids go to Garland High, you said?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	they're still in elementary.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, yeah.
B:	Well, there's a,
B:	it's, um,
B:	she went from Austin Academy when it opened up, over to, uh, to North Garland for ninth grade.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But at North Garland, the, the difficulty I see with the education system is that, uh, is that, you can, you can, you can get some masses,
B:	but unless, if the kid's really dedicated, it seems like they do all right.
B:	But if, if, if your child is just pressing along, uh,
B:	I, I'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough.
B:	Would you, argue with that?
A:	I'm definitely not,
A:	are you kidding?
A:	No.
B:	Well you know the, the, the thing that I don't see, and maybe you would take issue with it is that if, if we went to, if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around.
A:	No,
A:	I want that
B:	Well would,
A:	I think it would be better for the teachers and for the children, because we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have.
A:	I know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like they've lost so much ground, we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up, reteaching what they had the year before. You know.
B:	Well how do we how do we get that?
A:	Well, we're starting pilot schools.
A:	It's
A:	Dallas is doing it I know.
A:	I think Plano, don't they have some,
A:	and Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools, going to school year around.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then we, you know, we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it.
B:	Does it work well out there?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it seems to,
A:	and one thing, it'll save us money, because we've got the buildings sitting there,
A:	right,
A:	and we might as well use them.
B:	Well, what about the, what about the issue of air conditioning.
B:	Isn't that a an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning?
A:	Well, air conditioning, what's, and, and heating.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Isn't air conditioning less than heating, because we have to, just up
A:	like, if we get in the thirties, we raise it up to the seventies,
A:	right,
A:	that's forty degrees.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Isn't it less?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's less degree days,
B:	you're right.
B:	But I think, I think,
A:	And it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer,
A:	really, if you go year around there's not thirty days difference.
B:	Yeah.
B:	well how do they do it?
B:	Do they put, uh, long,
B:	do they put two or three week breaks between?
A:	There's different ways to do it.
A:	Like I, I think going two six weeks and then having two, two weeks off, each after a two six weeks period is one way.
B:	Is that,
B:	from, from what you've seen, is that the desirable way to do it?
A:	See, I don't know, because I've never seen it in action.
B:	Oh, you said you had some people from California.
B:	Oh I thought you,
A:	No,
A:	the school system in Dallas has sent people there to do that.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	No.
B:	But you didn't go.
A:	But I think I'd like it,
A:	and I know a lot of teachers that would like to try it.
B:	Well, the, the other issue has to, that I hear that the local commentator I listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal,
B:	do you see that the principals aren't really in charge?
A:	The principal's, their hands are tied, by all the administrators,
A:	and I heard that in Dallas, it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired
B:	Well I had heard that one of the comments when they, when they brought it,
A:	It's just,
A:	you don't even know who all your bosses are.
A:	It's ridiculous.
B:	Um. Then why the,
B:	the one they brought in, the new superintendent for Dallas schools, the um,
B:	can't think of his name,
B:	but the idea yeah, that he had suggested that, that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and, and some of the people who were administrators saying, that, that, uh, that's not what he was hired for.
A:	Marvin Edwards.
B:	But they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there.
A:	Well, you know he did, supposedly cut administrators,
A:	but what they've done is create other offices for those same people, and just renamed their jobs and, you know, opened up other other things.
B:	Um.
A:	One thing we've got going is called reading and initiative,
A:	and they've hired all these administrators in on that, you know.
B:	Well, you know, the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it that it took to contest the, the football, um, issue.
A:	Pass or no fail, what is it?
B:	Yeah
B:	but the
A:	No play.
B:	I can't think of the name of the school, that, that, uh,
A:	No play.
B:	but in any event they, they, they kept arguing.
A:	Carter High School.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they went to court,
B:	I mean, you know,
B:	guess I, I'm sympathetic with the kids,
B:	but, but how much money did that cost Dallas to, to, to fight that in court.
A:	And all the things that Dallas fights, costs thousands, probably millions of dollars, I bet you.
B:	But just think of all the, the, all the lawyers you've kept employed,
B:	see.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
A:	And psychologists and stuff.
B:	That's right,
A:	That's right.
B:	and, and all these other people are out running around.
B:	I guess that's the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce,
B:	so. But you need to keep all these people employed,
B:	right?
A:	No,
A:	we do not.
B:	And, and
A:	No
B:	You mean, you mean, we need a little more of our tax money, like maybe, uh,
A:	We need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students, because it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper,
A:	and you're trying to ration it, you know,
A:	now that's sad, when there's supposed to be what, you know, one thousand, what, sixty-five dollars, something like that, spent on each pupil.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, it's, it's wrong.
A:	Anyway, I was thinking about
A:	one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities,
A:	and I think in nineteen, uh, ninety-three we're supposed to begin that.
A:	If, if a child is a visual learner, we're supposed to present him with all these visual things,
A:	and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic, we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it, learns the best way.
A:	And that's going to be quite a problem.
B:	Oh that's,
A:	But if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help.
B:	Um, that's interesting,
B:	and how many administrators is that going to take?
A:	I don't know,
A:	no telling,
A:	I don't know.
A:	And, you know, at nongraded schools.
A:	They've had one in Gladewater for years and years and years.
A:	If we could just let these kids go at their own rate.
A:	I have children even,
A:	I, I teach Chapter One,
A:	and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to, like I T B S scores.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And some of the kids, really they shouldn't be in there,
A:	and they're, you know, they're not being challenged,
A:	and they're not being challenged in their home,
A:	and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's, that's part of where my son is, um, would like to go to Rice,
B:	but I don't think he's,
B:	well, the, the difficulty is, is, is the people that get in are, are, are overachievers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he's not an overachiever.
B:	But the same time, everybody can't go,
B:	but it,
B:	the question of, of, you know, of how far should you take a kid in the motivation,
B:	I'm not sure,
B:	I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids.
B:	I had a, a friend that was administrator in Richardson said if the parents read books, then the kids probably would read books.
A:	Right.
B:	But that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to, question of, of how much reading do those kids' parents do.
A:	My children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them.
B:	Well.
B:	Well, but that's the point, as I would say, uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that is, that's what makes,
B:	there's a lot of problems.
B:	But anyway, um, I'm trying to think how much longer.
B:	I had a conversation, week or so ago
B:	and we got carried away,
B:	and they cut,
B:	it beeps in at ten minutes.
A:	I know it,
A:	I know it
A:	I went for a couple
A:	and I didn't know that there was even a cut off or anything.
A:	Oh another things that's wrong with schools,
A:	this is big,
A:	there's too much emphasis on test.
A:	We're spending the first hour of every day teaching for the test at my school,
A:	and we're going to do that until at least the first part of May.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well see, that's in the Garland schools,
B:	the numbers,
B:	they, I don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes.
A:	But see, they're not in Dallas.
B:	Well, opportunity,
B:	right?
B:	If you get graded on percent improvement.
B:	But see, that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in Garland are.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And unfortunately, the, uh, that's, that's tough,
B:	that's a real challenge though.
B:	But, uh.
A:	But see, what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we're not teaching toward the test,
A:	we're teaching, you know,
A:	I always objected, you know,
A:	it's like there's not a whole lot of, you know, fun time like we used to have in school.
A:	Like our principal says, I want every child to be on task all the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And you can't do that as adults.
A:	But we're expecting kids to.
A:	And like after, after recess, play
B:	Yeah.
A:	we don't get that.
A:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If they finish before their thirty minutes is up, then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes, probably be the most.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But we always got that,
A:	didn't you?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	you know, our son had that,
B:	he was, had an attention deficit disorder,
B:	and they were keeping him from recess
B:	and in reality that's, uh, that's one of those really tough situations.
B:	I think the kids need some time to play.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, people like, if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and and change some education
B:	so. Uh, I got some background noise there
B:	but I guess ...
A:	Well, I, uh, before I was married, I used to play a lot of sports.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but when I got married and had children and everything, it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations
A:	so I haven't done a lot of, uh, exercise on purpose.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What about you?
B:	Well, it's funny,
B:	this week,
B:	yesterday I started exercising seriously.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	This weekend I cleaned out my closets
B:	and, uh, a couple years ago I, too, got married.
B:	I haven't have any children yet,
B:	but this weekend I cleaned out some closets
B:	and I found a bathing suit that I had bought.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me.
A:	Oh no,
A:	that can be awful.
B:	So yesterday I went to, uh, a spa.
B:	I belong to a private spa and went in and, and got with a trainer
B:	and, uh, he checked body fat content
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we set up a program for me to work on,
B:	and I went back tonight also.
B:	So I've been two nights in a row
B:	and I, I'm going to take it pretty seriously.
B:	I'm going to start going every night just, you know,
B:	even if I, I,
B:	like tonight I only went for thirty minutes,
B:	but I at least did something.
A:	Do you work out on,
A:	like, is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it?
B:	Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few, like, three different types of, uh, uh, weight lifting for my legs and, and my hips
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I did a hour of aerobics.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that was really tough
A:	Oh, I bet.
B:	And I was sore this morning when I got up,
B:	but then tonight I got into a, a,
B:	it's sort of like an aerobics class
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's only thirty minutes
B:	and it's for your abdominals your thighs, and your butt.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	So, and that was,
B:	thirty minutes was definitely plenty.
B:	So,
A:	Doesn't sound like low impact.
B:	No,
B:	it was a lot of sweat
A:	Well.
A:	Well that's good.
B:	So,
A:	So are you
B:	Have you started exercising at home
B:	or,
A:	Well, I, like, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise,
A:	but I like to, uh, play tennis and play racquetball
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort,
A:	and so that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, uh, the shape that I was satisfied with at least.
A:	And, uh, then I have given that up,
A:	but, uh, I would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a position that I like myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't feel good
A:	and I get, you know,
A:	when you get out of shape and you don't,
A:	if,
A:	you're easily tired
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so that has made me,
A:	but I, I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just,
A:	if something like, uh,
A:	I mean I have so many chores and so many obligations every day for, to add another obligation would make me feel stressed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I wouldn't enjoy it.
A:	But if I have something, some team sport or some activity, then it's kind of like having fun, playing
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then you, then you get some of the, uh, good exercise and some of the desired results,
A:	but you, you're doing it for fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I really admire people who can go and work out
B:	Well, I don't, you know,
B:	a lot of people,
B:	I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it
B:	and she walks around, talks to people
B:	and and, I don't really get into that.
B:	Naturally I'm married
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so my husband goes a lot
B:	and we'll go and, and just do what we want to do and then leave.
A:	Well, that's nice.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	and swimming is a, is a part that I, I'd like to get into as far as my you know,
B:	just aerobic activity they say that swimming is real good,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I'd like to try that as well.
B:	And that's probably something that, that you could do, you know family, included.
A:	Yes.
A:	It is kind,
A:	It is family,
A:	and it's fun.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's a fun thing
A:	and kids enjoy that and and all.
A:	And also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation, you know, like saunas, or you know, uh, hot Jacuzzis or whatever, they have that kind of is, kind of makes it fun and stuff, you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	You know, just going for it, they take it quickly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they don't think anything of that.
B:	And I don't, you know,
B:	that's makes people resentful too.
B:	And so, And yet they have, they have a right to be here
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	and I know that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's, it sometimes it's gets touchy.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So, and I'm sure it's a lot different,
B:	you're from Maryland,  You said?
A:	Yes,
B:	What part of Maryland are you from?
A:	Up in the Gaithersburg area.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	My sister used to live there,  in that area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I, I'm sure that it's a lot different there.
B:	Uh, it's a lot different in than, in Iowa than it is here.
A:	Well, no.
B:	Is that right?
A:	And with the same, you know, some of the, some of the same problems that you've mentioned.
A:	But, uh, I don't know,
A:	I guess I wasn't involved enough to, to, uh, really stop to think about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I, you know, since I teach, I see see it.
B:	And, and I feel
B:	and I love the example that most of these children give the, our American children.
B:	And yet, you know, I can see why some of the parents are that are fearful too.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, and it's a kind of a touchy situation.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened.
B:	But it doesn't happen that way all the time.
A:	Exactly,
A:	exactly.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	So anyway,
A:	Well, it was good talking to you.
B:	It was good to talk to, to you too.
A:	And I
B:	And have a good trip in California.
A:	Okay.
A:	And have a good weekend.
B:	All right.
B:	Well thank you.
A:	all righty,
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye
A:	Okay,
A:	do you have any, uh, ideas on universal health insurance?
A:	Do you have any strong opinions?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it's probably a good ideal,
A:	You do?
B:	uh, I think, given, uh, given, well given that there are so many people who don't have health insurance. It's probably a real smart thing,  at least to have some basic coverage for everyone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you hear these horror stories of people, homeless people going to the hospital and,  and being thrown out because they have no insurance,  and having to go to someplace else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, it would be nice if, no matter where you are, or who you are, what happened, you know, what happened to you, you just go to the hospital and they say, Okay, just, just take him,
B:	and we will worry about who he is later
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I feel like there should be some kind of coverage made,
A:	but I, I'm really leery of a, kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan, because I just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly
A:	and it is going to be about six times more expensive.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know, that, that's certainly true.
B:	But, I wonder about like, like in Canada.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In Canada, where everybody, uh, everybody automatically has insurance in Canada.
A:	Right,
A:	and they have that in England too,
A:	but I think that it's a pretty poor,
A:	they get a lot lower quality care than we do.
A:	Now, I know some people don't agree with me,
A:	but, uh, I know you have to wait real long time to get, for certain surgeries that aren't emergency,
A:	and you don't have the kind of choices that we have here,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals
A:	and I really don't want to give up having those choices.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's, that's true.
A:	I think,
A:	I mean, there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors, and good hospitals and bad hospitals.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	And in England, at least at the time when I was familiar with it, about ten years ago, they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be.
B:	Oh, you
B:	so didn't get any choices at all?
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	I mean that.
B:	Oh, that's a problem.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because I know, I know even among,
B:	even now, the way we have it now, there are still.
A:	It's getting worse,
A:	isn't it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean like we have,  an H M O allows us to pick our own physicians.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	I mean I picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had to switch because I just thought he was a quack.
A:	Right.
A:	That's exactly the problem,
A:	there's just so many, such variation
A:	and it's,
A:	but see, I guess, what they had in England, and I guess in Canada is socialized medicine.
A:	So maybe, that's like the extreme of it.
A:	Do you think?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that is the extreme,
B:	and what that, what that I think that tends to do though is I think that tends to,
B:	it probably has two, a good and a bad side,  for young people wanting to become doctors. Which again a lot of people who are motivated, because the money isn't, I guess, as much,  for doctors anymore,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	so you wind, you wind up getting the people who really want to be doctors, being doctors,
A:	Really want to.
B:	but then again, you know, you don't get those people who would be good,  and are real smart and decided, Hey, I want to make a lot of money,
A:	Right.
B:	so I will go into medicine.
B:	You don't get those.
A:	Right,
A:	or that,
A:	yeah,
A:	exactly,
A:	or people also get the feeling that, well jeez, you know, you don't have to worry about, you have a lot of job security there,
A:	and it's more of, uh, seniority, I would imagine kind of thing, instead of having a skill or, or whatever to advance,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of,
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it would be nice to see something where at least,
A:	I think we have to have something.
A:	We really do.
B:	I mean, even something that says you know look, free major medical for all, you know, everyone
B:	and then,  beyond that, you could work out on your own if you want.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know,
A:	I, I don't know,
A:	I,
A:	having worked in doctor's offices and stuff I see it from a physician's point of view.
A:	And I, I think the problem with the skyrocketing cost right now is the insurance companies because,  I don't see doctors getting real rich,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and I think hospitals do make money, but not nearly as much as insurance companies.
B:	Oh, right.
B:	No.
A:	I think they are really making a killing and nobody is talking about it.
A:	Nobody's,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are the ones who make,
B:	I mean they are the ones,
B:	they have, you know, the although,
B:	I mean, it's
B:	the unfortunate part of that is that the people, I think, tend to forget that doctors are humans as well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that
B:	insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people, or certain types of, of doctors, given that, you know, someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them, well, they could take, you know, it could be millions, I mean, unfortunately.
A:	Right.
B:	And if the doctor, whether, it was, you know,
B:	I mean I'm sure there are those cases where, where the doctor is wrong or malicious or something.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	But you know their, you know. Mistakes, you know.
A:	Their mistakes are made.
A:	Right.
B:	Everybody makes mistakes, unfortunately.
A:	Sure.
B:	It shouldn't be a billion dollar, you know, industry.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and this is, this is their compensation.
B:	Not,
A:	So, yeah,
A:	I think that's the legal part of it coming into it to.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is a big problem.
A:	I wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for.
B:	That would be nice.
A:	Or, or, I don't know because then that's where the insurance company,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It would be a lot better.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean I'm sort of in a, in a government run medicine program.
B:	Sort of.
B:	I'm in a,
A:	Are you?
B:	Well, well I'm a graduate student.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, uh.
A:	At where?
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'll bet you are in Texas.
A:	I
A:	what?
A:	I'm in Texas
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I was going to bet that,
B:	okay.
B:	Uh, yeah,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, great.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And because the university, the university offers me two plans.
B:	They offer what they call the mandatory version,  which is basically major medical
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	And, they don't,
B:	and even though my, my wife's insurance covers me,  for everything, I still have to pay them a hundred and some odd dollars a semester.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And that's for the mandatory portion of the insurance.
A:	That, that, that can't be legal.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not actually sure if it is or not
B:	but, people sort of keep fighting it
B:	and I'm,
B:	and I mean to keep fighting it,
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	but you know, it's just one of these things where I just don't want to spend my time.
A:	How can they, how can they make you pay for insurance coverage?
B:	Well, the reason,
B:	their rational is, is they make everyone pay for it so that it, it keeps the cost of university health services down,
B:	and everyone can use it.
B:	You know it.
A:	How, how does it keep the cost down?
B:	Because everyone is now forced to pay for this.
B:	And there is like an,
A:	Oh, so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy?
B:	Well, no,
B:	well, yeah,
B:	well what they use it
B:	no,
B:	what they use it for is, is, is university health services.
B:	We have a,  we have a hospital here, and a subportion of the hospital.
A:	So you're subsidizing the hospital.
B:	Right
B:	obviously, we're paying for the welfare state.
B:	Now, as it turns out, as it turns out, uh, my wife and I have chosen to use the university as,  health services as our primary care facility.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We can do that.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	So, in, in,
B:	but in effect, I'm paying twice for one service.
B:	So,
A:	You are, you are
A:	I know.
A:	And see that's the thing,
A:	that is the thing,
A:	now that I'm in my thirties now, and I have three kids
A:	and I mean, I'm very liberal.
A:	I'm extremely liberal,
A:	and, uh, I,
A:	but now I just in the last couple of years. I have gotten to the point where I am saying I just cannot afford to pay anymore,  to help people out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I want to keep helping people out
A:	but I need for the government or the agencies, to find a way to do it on the amount of money, you know, that I can afford.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just can't afford anymore.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's, it's just outrageously.
A:	It's just starting to get me angry,
A:	and for the first time in my life. I am starting to feel like I, I.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well that's, that's certainly true,
A:	I mean, if I can't afford to have some kind of optional operation for myself.
A:	Because our, our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over, let's see, the past five years, to the point now where even if we need surgery, our insurance only covers eighty percent of it.
B:	Right,
B:	which is ridiculous.
A:	And, right
A:	and so no matter what happens to me, if I get in a car accident this afternoon, I have no way of, you know, no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs,  because my insurance is now only eighty percent of whatever it's going to be.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, so on top of that, uh, then, what if I, what if we decide to have universal health insurance,
A:	I'm subsidizing,
B:	Everybody else.
A:	And what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say, Okay, well, you really need to have those varicose veins fixed, or your teeth fixed or something like that.
B:	Right.
A:	And I am paying for it.
A:	You know, stuff like that has happened with education and with other things that you hear about
A:	and it's just, Wait a minute
A:	You know, my kids aren't getting that.
A:	How come their, their kids are getting that?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly,
B:	I don't, I don't, uh.
A:	And I know it's only in a few cases
A:	and I don't want them to, uh, to cut funding for welfare programs or anything.
A:	I don't want them to do that, because I know a lot of people, they live right on the edge
A:	and they need that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's one of the strange,
B:	I think it's strange that as you get older.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think, I think the tendency is that as people get older,  and gain, I don't want, I don't want to say more responsibility, but you know, things like homes and kids,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	that's,
A:	and it's, uh, it's funny because a couple of years ago, I heard a quote from Winston Churchill.
A:	Let's see if I can remember it,
A:	anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart,
A:	and a person who is not a conservative in his fifties has no brain.
A:	It was something like that
B:	That's probably very true.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I don't know,
A:	I guess that's what's happening to me,
A:	but I, I think it's just starting, uh,
A:	it's, it's,
A:	I, I don't know maybe other people,
A:	I,
A:	do you think it's a sign of the times, that people are starting to say, All right, we really mean it, no more taxes
A:	or maybe this is just my own personal.
B:	No,
B:	I think, I think people are starting to really mean it,
B:	I mean everywhere you, you look, you are getting something new.
B:	I mean, you start off,  you know, especially, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you guys I believe in Texas you don't have state tax, do you?
A:	No,
A:	no income tax.
B:	Right,
B:	we have, we have federal income tax. State income tax, local income tax.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh.
A:	Wow.
B:	So on top of the federal tax on gasoline,  we have state tax on gasoline,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so we are just.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but I tell you, uh, we have incredible property taxes down here.
B:	Oh, that could be, uh, making up for the difference.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and we don't have the services either that other states have.
B:	Okay.
A:	All righty.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Probably some of that is divorce
A:	and some is they're more educated than they used to be I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I think sometimes, uh, leaders in government they've become more, uh, adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have more women in government.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, now I'll let you say something
B:	Well, uh, I probably a little bit older than you are,
B:	so what I see, uh, is,
B:	the change that I see the most is, is that, uh, women have much more, many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I went to college.
B:	When I went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary,
B:	or, but there were very few women in business at that time.
B:	A few,
B:	but they were the oddity.
A:	Very limited.
B:	And now I see
B:	and, and I see for my daughter, which is wonderful this,
B:	she's thirteen
B:	and I see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so many different jobs, which I think is terrific.
A:	Yes.
B:	Because I'm a teacher
B:	and, I mean, I love teaching,
B:	but, there, I think there are a lot of other things I would have liked better.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, not that I would give the career up because it's, it's a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I I need the income.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have, have started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must.
A:	I think that's right.
B:	Uh, you just,
B:	it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh, the male, uh, has an extraordinarily good job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And especially men who teach school, they don't make that much money,
B:	and, and most all,
B:	they always either have
B:	they're either moonlighting or else their, their wife works, too.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, it's just an economic need now.
A:	I really think women have so much more responsibility than, you know, as far as everything.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	And, like you said, uh, one, women today have so many, uh,
A:	the average today of having a, a single family, you know, with the mother as the head,  you know, it just really, uh, so commonplace,  nowadays.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	exactly.
B:	We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents
B:	and,  uh, the majority is, uh, married couple with children,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but still there's a lot more than there used to be.
B:	And see you never picture yourself in a situation like this.
B:	When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest of my life.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And, uh, but I'm all, I'm really grateful that I went to college.
B:	My mother always said, you know, get an education in case you need one, because my father died when we were,
B:	I have a twin sister
B:	and we were eleven when he died
B:	and she had a nursing degree,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she was able to make it.
B:	But, she said in you never know what's going to happen
B:	and I thank God that I did go to college and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children.
A:	You know, isn't that funny, uh, because the same thing happened to us, except I was twelve.
A:	And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession,
B:	Isn't that something.
A:	and was,
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	and even today I think the chance for education is is, is so much, uh, better for all of our girls,  and, and boys, too.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	But, but the girls especially.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do, too.
B:	But I think it needs to continue to change
B:	and I I think it, there's still not equality as far as, uh, paychecks for men and women.
B:	I think that the, we still have a long way to go.
A:	A lot of things,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think that, uh, I think by the year two thousand it, we're going to see some, a lot more changes, uh, hopefully, that women are, you know, able to get the, the executive jobs,  and hold positions that men, men do because they can do it just as well, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	if they want to dedicate their, most of their time to that they, they're, they can do it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I also think that in the future that, uh, it's going to continue.
A:	We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force.
B:	Uh-uh.
A:	I think they're going to stay there
A:	and I think that they're going to, uh, uh, be really responsible and, and do everything just like, what you said, you know, make, make it the grade and, and make it so women can be the top people in their,  in their field.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Exactly.
B:	And I think that's the way it should be.
B:	I think it
A:	Oh, I think so.
B:	I mean, not that I, I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, could never do strength wise and so forth
A:	Right.
B:	but, also there's some things women can do like have children,  that men can't do.
A:	Right.
B:	So, you know, it,
B:	I don't I don't want to be equal
B:	but, I, I want to be, I want to get what I deserve
B:	and I want to be able to be on the same level with them.
B:	If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay, you know.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And, And I just, I'm not a women's libber.
A:	Exactly.
B:	I really am not.
B:	But I, I think that that we have just as many rights as they do.
B:	And I feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay.
A:	That's right.
A:	And I think that is happening more and more.
B:	I do, too.
A:	I think it's just going to take a little bit longer.
B:	Oh, I do, too.
B:	Definitely
A:	Well, great,
A:	okay.
B:	Well, it was good to talk to you.
A:	Good to talk to you, Sally.
B:	All right.
A:	Thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I don't have any, I guess, definite views about elderly care.
A:	Um, the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see,  where elderly people are abused and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother, uh, in some sort of home.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I agree with you.
B:	I, um,
B:	a group that I'm a part of goes once a month to a, um, they call it the Heritage House.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, it's a nursing home for elderly people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, I watched,
B:	the interesting thing was I watched this particular one change hands.
B:	It started out just being a terrible place for the people,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then a new company bought it,  and came in and remodeled the whole place.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Hired new nurses and, uh, just really, just redid it, you know.
A:	Just out of curiosity, what, what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place?
B:	Well, to me, it was dirty, for one thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, when you would walk in, the smell was just,  awful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The, you know, the floors, you could just,  if you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and, you know, crying,
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right mind.  or how many were,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	In pain or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I just really don't know,
B:	but I feel like they were neglected.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, yeah,
B:	that was what I was going to say.
B:	It sounds like just neglect all over.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, neglect to cleanup.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't really think anyone was being, you know, cruel or,  or trying to mistreat them or anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I just think they were not doing anymore, you know, than they had to do.
B:	And, um, just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But this new company came in
B:	and they, like I said, they remodeled the place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it smells nice when you walk in.
B:	And it looks nice.
B:	And they got like several new color T V's for the people, And redid the dining room, where they made it, you know, a lot more place for them to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They made a little patio area where they can go outside.
A:	That's great.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Just, you know, small things that make it seem a lot more homey.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it's like, it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just, uh,
A:	I would, I would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that.
A:	And my biggest fear would, that they would be, is that they would be lonely.
B:	Right.
A:	And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room,  You know. Just makes, just brightens and, and,  and just makes them, just a little more active.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Television,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They can go outside
A:	and, just to know that they're not, you know, laying in a room,  looking at gray walls. You know,  that, that's what would just really kill me.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'd like to know that, you know, they have friends there,
B:	Right.
A:	and they have little conversations and things.
B:	Right.
A:	I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and, maybe some kind of, of activity, little field trips or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know how they would do that.
A:	But,
B:	Well, they, uh,
B:	this place that we visit, it's really neat.
B:	They have, everyday, they have schedules of groups that come in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they will do bingo.
B:	Our group does a church service once a month.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then other groups come in and do the services, you know, other Sundays,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that they have at least one service every Sunday.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So there are a lot of things.
B:	There are places that have a lot of things for them to do.
B:	But you really do have to kind of seek it out, you know,  and make sure that it's not a place like this one was
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that.
A:	That's,  really neat.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It's real nice.
B:	And, um, I know our church does it
B:	and there are a lot of other churches,
B:	and they are just like civic organizations,  that do.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I have other friends.
B:	It's kinds of neat, they take animals over and let the people pet them.
A:	Oh.
B:	Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
B:	and they will wash it all up,  and make sure it's, it's a friendly animal,  you know. And take it in and let, just let the old elderly people pet the dogs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That will be something, you know, they would look forward to if they knew, you know, that the puppy is coming on Wednesday.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, that would be something to look for.
A:	That's really neat.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That really is.
B:	I thought that was a real unusual thing, for someone to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	there's a lot that can be done.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just a matter of people not being lazy.
A:	Right.
B:	And, you know, doing the best they can.
B:	Again, I don't know what I'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother,  you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Putting any of my family in an elderly home, to me would be the very last resort.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, it, um,
A:	and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to, to work or trying to take care of your own family,  it's kind of hard to, to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent,  you know, on you.
B:	Right,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know that's hard sometimes
A:	and,  but it would really have to be a last resort,  because that would just,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would feel so guilty.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I would, too.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know.
B:	I know what you mean.
A:	I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because, um, many of them, of course, their minds are not good.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story, you know,  and tell me something that they did
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then the next time I go it's the same thing, you know,  that, just somebody to listen to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, just seems to make them really feel good.
A:	Nod your head and smile at them.
B:	Right.
B:	I'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for,
B:	there's a guy at this particular one I go to,  that I think that he's really an intelligent person,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, he's blind
B:	and he has seizures, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, he's just like in a world of his own,
B:	and yet he wants so much,  to be around people.
A:	Right.
B:	And if you come over to him, if he can touch your hand, he'll grab it and kiss it.
A:	Oh.
B:	Oh, and he's always got a smile.
B:	I mean, he really tries to, brighten up your life.
B:	Oh, it's just amazing.
A:	Oh.
B:	But he can't say anything.
B:	He can just kind of make noises.
A:	That's something, that, if I had to work in an elderly home, I don't think I could do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Like I, I would really like to be a teacher,
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I don't think I could do it. Because I'm very, very emotional.
B:	Me, too.
A:	And the minute, I mean, the minute something happens,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials.
B:	I know.
A:	That's just the end of me.
B:	I know.
A:	And so I mean something real life, I just,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I interview a lot of children,
A:	I'm an education reporter,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I always go and do an education things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And all the sudden, they're in this program.
A:	They're making straight A's,
A:	they're going to graduate early,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'm just, I just want to hug them,  and go, you are just fantastic.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And those people, they're so sweet and,  and so genuine, You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and all they want is just for everything to be happy,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, it does.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is,
B:	it's really hard
B:	and,  But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have a three year old and a six year old,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they, um, have gotten comfortable being around these people,  because they've always gone with us,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the people love them.
A:	I'm sure.
B:	And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand
B:	and, so far, my kids will do it. Just real easily,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they've never been afraid.
B:	But that's something,
B:	to me children,  you know, need to,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	people need to take groups of children, Because the kids just brighten up their lives.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here.
B:	I want to see her
B:	I would love to hold her.
A:	And children,
A:	I mean, usually a of elderly people like to, they like to, uh, share their experiences with the,  with the younger children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They'll be telling them all kinds of stories.  that they don't even know what they mean.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	You know, they feel like they've lived life
A:	so they need to share it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm sure I'll be like that, too.
B:	Well, me, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's quite an experience.
A:	But, that's great.
A:	I didn't know there were such groups.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	there are.
B:	And, and, uh, it really helps those people, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, like you said, I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It would be a last resort.
A:	And I would hate it if anyone put me in one.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	I'm always afraid like, oh,
B:	no,
B:	what if I lose my mind.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Am I going to end up in a place like that
A:	Somebody take care of me.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, nice to talk to you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You, too, Tonya .
B:	Thanks for calling.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	So have you got a pet.
A:	no,
A:	I don't,
A:	an
A:	my kids would love a pet.
A:	I had a pet when I was a girl.
A:	I had a Cocker Spaniel.
A:	And I think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company.
B:	Yeah,
A:	You can, you can tell them anything
A:	and they won't tell anybody.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's like unconditional affection.
A:	Right,
A:	as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love.
A:	They just give it, and don't expect too much.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Anyway, do you have a pet?
B:	I had a cat,
B:	I've had several cats.
B:	My pet, uh, was hit by a car New Year's Eve,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Oh! like a
B:	I'm going to get another one as soon as I get back in town.
B:	I'm going out of town this weekend,
B:	when I get back I'm going to find a cat.
B:	So,
A:	Oh, I'm so sorry.
A:	But that's good that you're going to get another one.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know some of my friends who have pets, uh,
A:	and they just are really, you know,
A:	the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them
A:	and I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets.
A:	But they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
B:	I work and go to school
B:	and it's kind of nice
B:	you come home your, your pet's there for you and wants a little food a little attention.
A:	Yeah,
A:	an,
A:	and my, my kids,
B:	And that's,
B:	it's kind of fun.
A:	um, they really want a dog badly,
A:	and they've been looking and looking
A:	and want, you know,
A:	they'd take anything I think
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, um, I don't know do you like,
A:	I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
B:	No
B:	it was an kind of indoor, outdoor,
B:	it, it was,
A:	It kind of traveled around
A:	travel .
B:	well yeah,
B:	I don't, I don't care for the smell of the litter box
B:	so my cat was trained to go outside,
B:	other than that it was inside when it wanted to be, it was outside when .
A:	Yeah,
A:	when I had a Cocker Spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog
A:	and, uh, I think I liked that better.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, think, you know,
B:	I like dogs,
B:	but I think that, uh,
B:	I'm,
B:	kind of like big big dogs
B:	and you have to have room for them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	And dogs take a lot of, a lot more care than cats do.
B:	Cats are pretty independent, you know,
B:	you feed them
B:	and they keep themselves clean
B:	and, if you, if you raise them right, you know, you don't have to worry about the litter box thing, where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	Take them for walks,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I see all the people on, on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs
A:	and, and I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog,
A:	I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something.
A:	So, I
B:	Yeah,
B:	I got to take care of a friend of mine's dog.
B:	He's just got a puppy
B:	and he was out of town last weekend
B:	and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet,
B:	so it was, go over there and clean up after the dog,
A:	Oh, that's exciting.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, kids kind of,
B:	they want the, they want the fun part and not the, not the work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That, that kind of gripes on me some,
A:	but, but I don't know.
B:	Well if you're, if you're going to have a pet,  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to, you know deal with the consequences, take care of the offspring
A:	More and more people are,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	and, and I think, you know,
A:	But, uh,
B:	when I was growing up we had cats
B:	and, you know, just seeing the cats, you know, the, the miracle of birth, you know, put that in quotes, is that's a, that's a neat thing to, to experience as a kid and understand,
A:	I think that's really true.
B:	and, and it was a real positive thing,
B:	but on the other hand you don't want to, you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	they're, they're, getting old now,
B:	and it's time to get rid of them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	So.
A:	Exactly.
A:	I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too,
A:	and, and that's good too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I think that's all I have to say.
B:	Okay,
A:	Okay,
A:	have a good night.
A:	All right,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	what kind of
A:	do you have children?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have one that's seventeen, one that's fifteen, and one that's just now six.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put Michael's goods ,
B:	his birthday is the first of September,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he was going to school at five.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, he started the first grade when he was five
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	first grade when he was five years old.
A:	And you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, we could, you know,
B:	we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something.
A:	Right.
B:	And it was, uh,  mediocre expensive,
A:	But,
B:	it wasn't really that expensive,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something.
A:	To learn something.
A:	And that's, I mean, that's
A:	even not only toddlers but, you know, even your older children.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's hard to find anywhere they're really going to learn something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well,
A:	And then, yeah,
A:	you do have to pay, you know, if you,
A:	the better the place, the more you're going to pay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
A:	True,
A:	very true.
A:	It's,
B:	You know, my wife works
B:	so,  it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so. We try to,
A:	If I had any children I would, uh, I hope that I'll be in a position to stay home with my child because I'm not real, uh, uh, trusting of a lot of people,  uh, especially today.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see I don't know,
A:	People,
A:	I work in the news business
A:	and I just see different things all the time,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and people are just crazy these days.
A:	They're crazy
A:	and,  and I don't, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it takes me a, takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend,  much less to, you know, trust someone with my, with my child.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, see we took our time
B:	and we checked it out,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we found a preschool for him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it, you know,
B:	through other folks where I, where I work,
B:	I work at T I.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
B:	it was actually at a licensed preschool,  you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we, had those requirements,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so,
A:	I guess that's the best way, you know, to get,  recommendations from your friends or,  family members.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I know,
B:	I'm,
B:	well,
B:	that
B:	and, you know, I don't think I would have left him anywhere that would,
B:	I would have stayed home with him first,  before I left him somewhere that, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here  you know, I just, I, I don't think I'd take that chance.
A:	Huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I think it's out of sight or out of mind,  for less than,  for more than,  a minute or so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	I mean you have to be, you've got to be sure,  that these people,
A:	I mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything,  but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them, you know,  that they wouldn't let them drink something or, you know, eat something off the floor,  you know,
B:	But you never know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	just simple things,  that can be harmful.
B:	But you, you know,
B:	as,  as far as child abuse is these days you never know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you don't know who you can trust,  and who you can't, you know.
A:	Huh.
A:	Then you hear so much, you know, on the news about, uh, child care places
A:	and also, um, senior care facilities, you know, you hear abuse.
B:	Yeah,
B:	senior care, is getting real bad.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and so you just, you just don't know,
A:	and you almost want to, you know, spend a couple of weeks with, in class with your child just to see how it is or something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	So, you have no children at all.
A:	No,
A:	I don't.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Gee.
A:	No.
A:	I'm,
B:	Do you miss that part in your life
B:	or,
A:	Uh, no,
A:	I'm only, I'm twenty-three  still have a little bit of time,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	um, it's just not in the cards for me right now
A:	I'm trying to get my career going.
A:	And,
B:	I imagine,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah,
B:	working in the news production,
A:	Yeah.
B:	anyway back to the subject,
A:	Yeah.
B:	we should have discussed this earlier,
B:	but anyway, it's tough,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it really is,
B:	it's hard to find good child care,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's,  going to be fine all day long.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you brought up a good point, you know,  about learning,
B:	And,
A:	you just don't want a baby-sitter
A:	you, you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their A B C's or something, you know,
A:	get them,
B:	Yeah,
B:	you know, and he's, he's doing real well,
B:	it, it, it has paid off for him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He's in first grade now,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's, you know, got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level.
A:	Huh.
B:	So, you know, those early ages when he would, you know, when his mom and dad are at work,  and he's actually in child care in a preschool not,  just child care,  you know, we could have sent him to anybody,  you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something,  has paid off not only for us,
A:	Right.
B:	his, his attitude is I think a little bit,  tall for a six year old
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, but his,
A:	Did you take this same, uh, route with your other two children?
B:	Um, they, they were outside my marriage,
A:	Okay
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, I don't know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was wondering how,
B:	I would say, no,
B:	but, you know, all my children,  excel,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they're, they're really good,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I guess, no,
B:	he learns from the older boys too
B:	but,
A:	Right.
A:	And it helps that he has older brothers, uh,  you know, just to have role models and things like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	seeing
B:	like, uh, in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys,
B:	but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share,
B:	but, you know,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so, we faced that too
A:	Huh.
B:	he learned quite a bit from, not only from nursery school
B:	but he learned quite a bit from the older boys,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, he's excelled
B:	and it's paying off for him,
B:	it really is.
B:	He's,  he is pretty smart,
A:	That's excellent.
B:	sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	but he is smart you know.
A:	Well, what kid isn't  these days,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
B:	But I think it's important, I think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace,
B:	I don't know, you know, how it is down there in Waco,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but in Lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
B:	and they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat.
B:	And,
A:	Do they have any kind of program like at T I or wherever your wife works, um,  some in kind of day care?
B:	No,
B:	not in,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	We just,
A:	Huh, because I know they're, they're putting that into a lot of, uh, corporations now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're trying to.
B:	The federal government is trying to intercede on that too,
A:	Right.
B:	so, no,
B:	we don't get,
A:	So, maybe that will be an option for,
B:	Well, it would be nice, you know, there,
A:	But then I, I foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but, you know,  kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's not,
B:	well,
B:	You know, where, where we sent Michael the first few years was, there was different teachers all the time, you know,
A:	Huh.
B:	and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, and then they had a group of kids
B:	and they put on skits
B:	and they put on plays,
A:	Huh.
B:	and they did the Halloween thing,  and the Valentine's Day things
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's, you know, it was important to us,
A:	Huh.
B:	so we, you know, we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way.
A:	Do you think it would have been better for him to have, um, maybe one continuous teacher, somebody to, that he could, uh,  get attached to
B:	Um,
A:	or is it better the other way with a lot of different,
B:	No,
B:	because I think, you know, as a child growing up I think is a task that belongs to his parents.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't think he needed to be attached to too, even though he did,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, he attached himself to a couple of those,
A:	Right.
B:	but I think his attachments at home
B:	and, you know, he gets the idea of what school is for
B:	and, uh, you know, I have different teachers,  here
A:	Huh.
B:	and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach, teach me another
B:	and, no,
B:	so, I, I, I really can't say that it would be, it's important for him to attach himself to anybody.
A:	Right,
A:	huh.
B:	He did well,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	each child is individual,  in life learning and things.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see.
B:	But I don't have that experience,
B:	so, I can't say that,  you know, he did well,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, I don't think we made too many mistakes.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, it sounds good,
B:	We tried hard.
A:	sounds like he's doing real well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's doing real well.
A:	Huh,
A:	good.
B:	And he learned from it
B:	so, and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day.
B:	You know, baby-sat sounds to me like, well, you're here, I guess I'll watch you when I get time.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, maybe I'll clean my house, maybe I'll cook you lunch,  maybe I won't, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they'll probably sit him in front of the television,  you know, while they do other things,
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I don't, you know,  I don't allow that when he's at home
B:	so, but we had a good experience,
B:	and we really did well.
A:	Well, that's good,
A:	that's good.
B:	So, and he did, he served better than we did, you know,
B:	he gained, he actually gained from it, you know,
B:	sure we gained from it,  because we were allowed to continue our employment and,  continue our family
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something,  instead of just sitting around watching T V,  and playing all day.
A:	That's great.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And it's important.
A:	That's probably what I'll try and look for whenever I do have my children,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know when that will be,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, um, you know, just really look into,
A:	it will, it will take me a long time to find somewhere I'm sure,  just because I, I just want to be, I want to be so positive that, you know, my children are okay,  as well as the other children in the center, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, his Mom didn't go back to work until, you know, when he was six months old.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we just didn't want to dump him somewhere,  and make him feel like he wasn't wanted.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And we wanted his center of attention at home
B:	but,  we did what we could
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it, it worked out real well,
B:	I'm glad,  we were so careful.
A:	It's difficult these day,
A:	It's, it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times,
B:	Oh, yeah,
A:	and, so, you have to find day care,  whereas, you know, here,
B:	Most of the time now it's a necessity,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you can't afford,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, you know, I'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No choice,
A:	so child care's a necessity, whereas years ago, you know, the husband basically worked and the wife,  basically stayed home.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, I'm forty now
B:	but, you know, when I was a kid Mom was always at home.
A:	Right.
B:	So, we didn't,
A:	I think that has a lot to do with just, just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is, is breaking, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is,
B:	yeah
B:	it is,
A:	the basic family is not there anymore.
B:	I'll agree with that, it is.
B:	It's, it's not there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that plays a big part in, in a child's learning and, you know, what they can and cannot do in child care.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think,
A:	Okay.
B:	Well let's start with you
A:	Okay, um,
A:	the last movie I saw was the FIVE HEARTBEATS
A:	and I liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it.
B:	FIVE HEARTBEATS?
A:	Yeah
A:	it's, It's, it's, uh, Robert Townsend movie.
B:	Who, who was in that.
B:	Okay.
A:	Um, I, I don't know all the actors or anything,
A:	but it was just, it was a lot of music a lot of old songs, things like that.
B:	When was it out?
A:	Um, it's still out now, uh,
A:	it came out I guess about a month or, about a month and half ago, something like that.
A:	It's about a Black singing group.
A:	It,
A:	and, uh, it was called the DELLS,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it was kind of like just about their, their life, and their, uh, history and things like that and the way they went from, from, how they went from stardom to nonstardom.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, that was pretty good.
A:	I enjoyed,
A:	I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES.
A:	Have you seen that?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I saw that one,
B:	that was pretty good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, that won best picture, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And Costner got best director.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right now Kevin Costner, I mean, he's starring in everything.
A:	He's doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out, um,
A:	and there's one,
B:	Another Kennedy movie, huh
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	starring Kevin Costner,
A:	and let me see,
A:	what else.
A:	Um, he's doing some other movie,
A:	I can't,
A:	I think ROBIN HOOD, that's it,
A:	the ROBIN HOOD coming out
A:	and he's going to be in also.
A:	And, let me see,
A:	what else have I seen.
A:	What have you seen?
B:	One comes to mind here
B:	and I not sure about the name, has Meryl Streep
B:	and, um, what was the name of that?
B:	Anyway the
B:	the premise of the story is that, uh, uh, uh, you go to a after you die you go to a place called Judgment City.
A:	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
B:	And, um, anyway,
A:	My.
B:	uh, I can't
B:	the other, the other actor, uh,
A:	It's called REVIEWING MY LIFE, or something like that.
B:	Yeah
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I didn't get to see that.
B:	DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's it,
A:	okay.
B:	DEFENDING YOUR LIFE,
B:	and it's, it's an excellent movie, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's pretty entertaining, uh.
B:	Let's see,
B:	what else have I seen lately, um.
A:	One of my favorite movies, it's not one that I haven't seen,
A:	I,
A:	it's not a late movie. FATAL ATTRACTION
B:	HOME ALONE.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's probably my all time,
A:	well not all time favorite,
A:	but one of my favorites, that I can watch over and over.
B:	well, did you ever see HOME ALONE?
A:	No,
A:	I never did,
A:	I, I heard it was really good,
A:	I've never, just haven't gone out to see it.
B:	That was a, that was a good one, too.
A:	Was that pretty funny?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's pretty good,
B:	and, um.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	somehow just never made it to see that,
A:	but I need to see it.
B:	I can't believe I'm just drawing a blank, because, I've
A:	Yeah,
A:	FATAL ATTRACTION, that, I don't know why I like that movie so much,
A:	I guess it was so much suspense.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I like suspense.
B:	That kind of reminds me
B:	like, uh, did you ever see, this is going way back, uh, JAGGED EDGE.
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	on that order.
B:	that was a good one too,
B:	yeah.
A:	Certainly is.
B:	But, uh.
A:	And I liked the woman that played in that,
A:	I forgot what her name is now.
B:	Yeah
B:	that's,
A:	Anne Archer she's the one, she was the wife in FATAL ATTRACTION,
A:	yeah,
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and she played in, uh, narrow margin which was a little more recent,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that was kind of another suspense type, Alfred Hitchcock type thriller.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That was good.
A:	Uh, God, I guess I haven't seen too many movies lately.
A:	I need to,
B:	I haven't seen a whole lot either,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Somehow,
A:	I mean it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive, you know,
A:	I'd, I'd rather rent.
B:	I know
B:	it's it's obnoxious, because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but then you end up spending another six dollars on food.
A:	Yeah
A:	and that's just for a a bucket of popcorn, you know.
B:	And a pop, you know,
B:	so it's, it gets pretty,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	God forbid you should want something to drink with it,
A:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah
B:	like if I,
B:	so if I take a date, it, it cost me, you know, twenty bucks, easy.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah
A:	easily.
B:	And, uh, I don't know.
A:	And you're usually going to do, you're usually going to go to a dinner, go to dinner or something with that.
B:	I was going to say, you, you know, you can find certain restaurants that are nice, and have good food for eat for thirty dollars.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's almost more fun really,
A:	yeah,
A:	it's almost more fun really to rent movies. You know, just kind of stay at home, maybe.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the problem is you always have to wait until they're out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true too.
B:	So that's what you're, you're, uh, dealing with.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but then you can make your popcorn and you know, be comfortable.
B:	That's true,
B:	that is true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well.
A:	Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently
B:	I ought to open the paper here because I know I've seen a few that have, have played.
B:	But, um, I just can't come up with any names here,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	haven't, haven't been to one for a little while,
B:	but, um. Did you ever see KINDERGARTEN COP?
A:	No,
A:	I never did.
B:	That was pretty good.
A:	Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, um.
A:	There's a movie I do want to see, uh,
A:	I haven't seen it,
A:	what is it, oh,
A:	KISS BEFORE DYING.
B:	Yeah,
B:	whose in that?
A:	It looks, it looks pretty suspenseful.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Another one I saw is called the OBJECT OF BEAUTY.
B:	I don't recommend that, as much as, uh, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE,
B:	but, it was, it was all right, kind of funny.
B:	Um, but, um, what else has been on and about.
A:	Are you looking in the paper?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'm trying to,
B:	I wanted to get to the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
B:	I hear that,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that was great.
B:	Oh, did you see that?
A:	Yes,
A:	that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too,
A:	that was an excellent movie.
A:	It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital, uh, near to where I live
A:	and they were saying that some of the patients there, you can't leave by themselves, because they'll make a weapon out of anything, you know,
A:	out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And this guy in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lector, he was, he was that kind of person,
A:	and you,
A:	they couldn't leave him alone
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it was, it was really
A:	he was very dangerous,
A:	but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, but they couldn't leave him alone at all.
A:	And they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time,
A:	but I won't tell you that, just in case you see the movie.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'll probably try to go to see it in a little while here.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	oh very good.
B:	But it's been out for a while.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	oh yeah.
A:	I'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores,
A:	it should be a while yet, though.
B:	Have you heard anything on, like, OUT FOR JUSTICE.
A:	Oh, I haven't heard anything about it.
A:	I,
A:	but I don't like Steven Seagal things, uh,
A:	so.
B:	Has he had, has he had very many other movies out?
A:	He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE
A:	and there was one right before that with a similar title
A:	like, uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title.
A:	That's why, I, I just don't like the,
B:	Because it's a macho movie.
A:	yeah,
A:	it is,
A:	I, I don't like that a lot.
A:	I don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either.
B:	Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that might be good, though,
A:	that might be good.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I've enjoyed a lot of his movies,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, they just, they're action filled, and a little bit of humor,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh.
A:	I guess, I'm not fond of the action packed movie, where they're always chasing or fighting,
A:	or, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I like the more, movies that make you think.
B:	Yeah,
B:	did you ever see, um, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't seen that yet,
A:	and that's something I really should have seen.
A:	Was that good,
A:	did you see it?
B:	I haven't, I haven't heard much lately.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a friend of mine saw it
A:	and she said it was okay, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	it wasn't anything spectacular.
B:	You expect more out of, uh, Julia Roberts, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the previews looked so good that I wanted to see it
A:	but I never did, uh.
B:	Did you ever see the original F X movie.
A:	well I saw half of it,
A:	and I remember I was in school, I saw half of it
A:	and I fell asleep
A:	and everyone else watched it
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	because I was going to say I always enjoyed that,
B:	I, I, uh, I remember that movie,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it was,
B:	I mean I got in to it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I really need to go see the original one,
A:	I'm sure it was a good movie,
A:	I just, I probably had a test that day, or something,
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	it's, it's, it's, it's, uh,
B:	I can't put it exactly on the lines of the JAGGED EDGE,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	you get these twists
B:	and, it's usually pretty good,
B:	but, uh.
A:	I think, I think though, that movies are losing their luster.
B:	What's that?
A:	I think movies are losing their attractiveness, just to a lot of people.
A:	Just,
A:	I think,
A:	I don't know,
A:	because of the cost
A:	and, I think it, it's just losing its originality or something.
A:	I don't,
A:	I can't pin, pinpoint it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	But it doesn't seem like it's as big, uh, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be.
B:	That's probably true.
B:	I, I, I
B:	just you see the same story lines, different characters
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	exactly.
B:	it's, it's, it's hard to say.
B:	An,
B:	and I know I don't,
B:	you, know, I don't keep up with it, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, I don't try to
B:	just for that reason, it is a, it does cost a lot,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so why go out and see something right away, you know,
B:	you kind of wait
B:	and if something gets really good reviews, maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks, you know to go to it.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, um, you know, I haven't been to a to an opening for, oh, you know ages, Just because.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	in Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	I guess we're set.
A:	Um,
B:	Current events.
A:	I get my current events basically from news, uh, just because I watch,  pretty much a lot of television, um,
B:	Television news?
B:	Is it, uh, C N N or HEADLINE NEWS or just local,  news
A:	Uh,
B:	or,
A:	I watch a little bit of everything.
A:	I like to tune into, to C N N because, uh, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on,  everything,   in about five or ten minutes.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	I think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance.
A:	Like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, really quickly,  on regular stations.
B:	Well,
B:	on commercial radio, I guess, I, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,  or evening on the way to school
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's good, too,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so, So, I don't, uh, I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school,
A:	I like K R L D.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I do here.
A:	Yeah,
A:	where do you go to school?
B:	Uh, University of Texas at Dallas.
A:	Oh, Okay.
A:	I went to U T at Austin.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, I'm a news reporter
A:	so I, I should get all I can , my news from the from the T V.
B:	Really.
A:	But, um,
B:	I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play,  and listen,
A:	Yeah,
B:	but, uh,
A:	I usually don't intentionally. Although I should, I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.
B:	Right.
A:	Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news.
A:	If it comes on, I just happen to hear it.
A:	Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to to, in to look at the news.
A:	But other,
B:	Yeah,
B:	all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	That's about it.
B:	That's about it,
B:	yeah.
A:	The Sunday paper, it's so full of stuff,
A:	but you pick your favorite section,
A:	and the rest,  you throw away.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it
A:	but,
B:	I like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, I don't know, it's variety,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour .
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it usually is.
B:	They throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries.
B:	It's kind of like getting a newspaper.
B:	There's a lot of sections to it
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and they, they present different sides of things.
A:	Um.
A:	Because I find like on K R L D,
A:	I like to listen to that,
A:	but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.
B:	Oh, well they spend a little more time, you know,
B:	they cover the headlines,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and,  interviewing people.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would probably be better.
B:	And it's,
A:	Especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They have little, little, teeny-weeny news, breaks, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and only in the morning, I guess, there's a little bit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	basically.
B:	I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So,
A:	So let's see, um,
B:	And I guess I get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things
B:	but,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh,
B:	Right
B:	Yeah,
A:	But, um,
B:	a lot of people are.
A:	Yeah,
A:	trying to get out of wherever they are
A:	but, um, I think, I think news is,
A:	I'm wondering where it's going.
A:	You know how,
A:	I think it will be pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper.
A:	I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news.
A:	And now, it's, it's kind of your final choice.
A:	You watch,
A:	first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	where nobody wants,  to sit down and read.
A:	And I think it,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	It's, it takes a lot more time to read something,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you've got news,  bombarding you from everywhere now.
A:	So much more effort.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know you,  turn on the T V, turn on the radio.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.
B:	Why is that?
A:	I don't,
A:	well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio.
A:	You still, you have two or three,
A:	I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations.
A:	And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just,
A:	And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in,
B:	I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is.
B:	And I enjoy reading,
B:	but most people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and,  flip through the channels, you know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,
A:	True,
A:	yeah.
A:	True.
A:	That's true, too,
A:	yeah.
A:	Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper.
B:	Right.
B:	And they don't have to go get one, you know.
A:	One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed in to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it.
A:	That's all you have time for.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio because they get on one of these little things,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they give you headlines that are brief,
B:	just,
B:	they touch on what's going on.
B:	And then they'll get into something and really explore it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And it's, it's informative.
B:	It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because that's what we do.
A:	I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.
A:	So, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's so much going on in the world.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Communication, you know, expands the world now.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	There's too much going on.
B:	You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.
A:	I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news,
A:	and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.
B:	And the question is, how much of it or how, some of it,
B:	I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is it, is it the true story
B:	or is it a little bit biased.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they could tell us.
B:	Right.
A:	So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know.
A:	So that, that was pretty scary.
A:	But we,
A:	I talked to one woman,
A:	and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on.
A:	And at the same time, I talked to another woman,
A:	and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam.
A:	And she didn't know what was happening at that time.
B:	Right.
A:	And she was so happy to get the information, you know.
A:	So there's just a lot of different opinions on that.
A:	But,
B:	I, I, you know, I like to, to know what's going on.
B:	Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News
B:	and it will play over and over
B:	and you just tune it out because it's the same thing
B:	but,
A:	And then, too, a lot of times I think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they tend to,  dramatize things.
A:	Like,
A:	You know, like this Kennedy thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	like a It's just, I mean, everywhere you turn.
A:	Kennedy,
A:	Kennedy,
A:	Kennedy.
A:	You know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night?
A:	And you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous.
B:	Like who cares?
B:	Really.
A:	So,
B:	Well,
A:	But what are you doing?
A:	Sitting on a computer?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I heard the little clicking.
B:	Trying to do some C programming.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay
A:	Okay.
B:	Take care.
A:	Take care.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	bye.
A:	There a lot of places to camp in Dallas?
B:	Well, not necessarily in Dallas,
B:	but it's a very short drive to areas near here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you do a lot of camping?
B:	Well, I have done camping in the past.
B:	Uh, I can't remember when the last time I actually went camping was.
B:	It was, uh, several years ago,
B:	and then I did most of my camping in the mountains.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that must have been fun though.
B:	Well, it is.
B:	I enjoy hiking and camping.
B:	We went to the
B:	. I have, uh, some land there,
B:	and so it's, it's handy to, to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and, and overnight camping.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that sounds fun.
B:	Do you do most of yours in tents?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we've done ours,
A:	I've only been camping twice.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And one of them I don't really consider camping.
B:	Um.
A:	It was on the edge of the lake
A:	and it was at a camp.
A:	I don't like those camping grounds where, you know, you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just don't care for that.
B:	No,
B:	I agree with you.
B:	I think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where,  that you can't see people right out the window.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	But,
A:	Well, it doesn't, uh,
A:	we, uh,
A:	four years ago,
A:	it was about four years ago, my little boy was three months old
A:	and the first time I left him we went overnight camping.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we went, and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake.
A:	And we had a ball.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just sat out there with our,
A:	we didn't even use tents then,
A:	we just had, uh, sleeping bags and fire going.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning.
B:	Doesn't that always taste so much better,  when you're out like that.
A:	Oh, it did,
A:	it did.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't even think about frying potatoes.
A:	But my sister-in-law, she's always done a lot of camping.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she's good.
A:	She'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out.
A:	And, yeah.
B:	That's right.
B:	If you don't you'll find every rock on it when you put your when you put your bag down.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well,
A:	yeah,
A:	she was, she is always prepared,
A:	I mean, she brought everything from, like I said, toilet paper to the rake.
A:	The only thing we'd had to do, we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, and we, and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we broke the, I guess it's the freezing component
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we broke that out of there and put it over our, um, hole.
B:	Oh, what a clever idea
A:	Yeah.
B:	I wouldn't have thought about that.
A:	Well, it held our pan and, you know, the potatoes and stuff.
A:	We had a good time.
B:	Oh, that's a good idea.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're still waiting to go again.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well if you get a chance,
B:	now there are some really nice camping areas, uh, up in the Wichitas, which is in Oklahoma and, uh, Arkansas.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Arkansas.
B:	I can't remember the name.
B:	It's, it's on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it won't take but just a, you know, just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I took a drive up through there, as a matter of fact, last September, just took the drive through to see what was there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They have some wonderful camping areas there.
A:	Pretty.
B:	Beautiful, beautiful country.
A:	Well, I love to swim,
A:	so I like to get out by a lake or a, uh, you know, somewhere close where we can swim.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	well, Lake, Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we had a two bedroom mobile home there,
B:	but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	How old are your boys?
B:	Oh, oh they're grown now.
A:	Oh, so they don't go camping with you.
B:	They go camping on their own.
A:	Oh.
B:	Once you start them, they enjoy it all their lives.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I haven't taken my little boy yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm afraid to get him out.
A:	He is so fearless, he, it terrifies me.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	He,
B:	Oh, don't be concerned.
B:	There's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere.
A:	Think so?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's the water he's not scared of.
A:	He'll go out into it until it's up to his nose and then try to tread back
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it's easy to keep him occupied though on land.
B:	I know that I took my kids, we'd go out,
B:	and I've them walk with me along the lakefront
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell, and finding the biggest shell.
B:	And, or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some, uh, pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out.
B:	We, you know, we,  we searched for
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we ate the wild plants
B:	and we gathered wild berries,
B:	and, uh, it's really, you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	the, the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find.
A:	If you know what to look for.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had my boys build their own little you know, three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark.
A:	Well, that sounds so neat.
B:	And, uh, we cooked in a pot.
B:	I baked them a cake, right there on a camp fire.
B:	They were so impressed.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven.
A:	Well, I'm impressed
A:	My mother-in-law
A:	and my,
A:	well, they've always done a lot of camping.
A:	I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky
A:	and there wasn't,
A:	I don't know,
A:	but we just didn't get out.
A:	My mother and my father split up when we were young,
A:	so, and my mother wasn't into that,
A:	and that's who I stayed with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we didn't do much outdoors stuff, except swimming
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we went swimming a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, oh, excuse me, my baby's getting sick.
B:	Uh-oh.
A:	I know.
B:	Well, if our time is up we can quit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, I've got to clean her up
A:	I'm sorry,
A:	appreciate it.
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I enjoyed talking.
A:	Thank you.
B:	You bet,
B:	bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	I hope you know more about the subject of baseball
A:	and where they're going than I do
B:	Oh, I know a little bit about it.
B:	I'm not a die-hard fan
B:	but I, I enjoy the,
B:	I like the Boston Red Sox myself.
A:	Well, I,
A:	of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best.
A:	However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years,
A:	but I have kept, uh, my eye on the Rangers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know
A:	and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point,
A:	and then they kind of fell on their face
B:	Well, with, uh,
B:	their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,
B:	so.
A:	Correct,
A:	right.
B:	Right
B:	Oh, it's amazing.
A:	They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money.
B:	Right.
A:	You know it's just, uh, phenomenal
B:	Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.
A:	Well, good.
B:	Um, I've been really busy at work this past week
B:	and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper
B:	and, uh,
B:	so every day I'll have a newspaper at work,
B:	and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.
B:	But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop
A:	I understand.
A:	I understand.
B:	But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, you are involved with T I uh, speech, um, recognition?
B:	Well, not really.
B:	I, um I work at laboratory.
A:	How did you find out about it?
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	From, uh,
B:	I'm an officer in the Air Force,
A:	I see.
A:	Interesting.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I, at, uh, not in my office
A:	I see.
B:	but, uh, in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	And the topics are interesting, uh,
A:	they run a whole gamut of, of, uh, subjects,
A:	and, uh, I think we can address every topic,
A:	but the depth of knowledge is quite different.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
A:	So, uh, when they chose baseball,
A:	I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand baseball, you know,
A:	I don't understand football.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I prefer to,
B:	I, I like,
B:	I never used to really like watching football that much
B:	but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game,
B:	but I've always liked baseball.
B:	I, I prefer to watch, um,
B:	I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.
B:	And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game.
A:	Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.
A:	But I can't relate to football because I've never, played football and, and don't, and have any interest,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football.
A:	And, uh, I had four daughters
A:	so that wasn't a question,
A:	but now I have a grandson that you know, is gung ho for, uh, football.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well,
B:	Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.
A:	I understand that,
B:	I'd, I,
A:	but I think the, they happen more in football.
A:	I think the odds are cut down.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.
A:	The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage
A:	but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.
B:	it's true.
B:	I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less, troublesome sports,
A:	Because
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, for some people it's just, uh, uh,
A:	A love for them.
B:	Well, that,
B:	not so much that
B:	but, uh, even in baseball you can,
B:	like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing the ball because I very, I was always very strong
B:	and I
B:	when I was young I could throw harder, than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see.
B:	And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, having trouble.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, and I was a catcher
B:	so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff.
B:	So I,
B:	that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,
B:	so.
A:	Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?
B:	No,
B:	I did that wrestling
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	No,
B:	I'd,
B:	well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things
B:	and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.
B:	But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like,
B:	now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling,
B:	but it,
B:	as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me
B:	then playing football this fall, I, it was just flag football too. I separated it again
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it seemed to be, like the straw that broke the camels back,
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three.
A:	It was never set right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.
A:	And, uh, one of the men that was in our on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.
A:	And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.
A:	And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.
B:	My God.
A:	So, uh, yeah
A:	Um, it was really funny, you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, uh, follow through with my, uh,
A:	addressing that , to put the ball,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the, uh, pins.
A:	So that was interesting.
A:	So I really, um, I got a lot of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not sure where all my pins came from,
A:	but it's,
A:	but that was quite awhile ago
A:	but I, and I never pursued it.
A:	And a lot of people said, well, you should have turned pro.
A:	And I thought, no,
A:	not
A:	I don't,
A:	my love wasn't there for the game.
A:	I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment and I, uh, fellowship
B:	Sure.
A:	but outside of that, no.
A:	I didn't.
A:	And I, and I still, I like to bowl,
A:	but, uh, I don't have, uh, Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do
B:	Are you on, you on any leagues now?
A:	No,
A:	I'm not.
B:	Oh.
A:	No.
A:	No, uh,
A:	at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement
A:	and, uh, it's true bowling
A:	and I've never, uh, shared that with them.
A:	I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, uh, win a lot of money for the junior achievement, uh, organization.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be to do.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years.
B:	I don't know,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	a long time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And she still, she's got to be,
A:	Still carries a good uh, average?
B:	Well, no,
B:	she
A:	Okay.
B:	So, what's it been doing up there?
A:	It's real dry up here.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	We need rain really bad.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well,
A:	All the farmers, you know,
A:	well, it's good for hay.
A:	You know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything,
A:	but they're going to need some you know, rain to get the second cut.
B:	Oh.
A:	I, I'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field,
A:	and if we don't have rain, she's going to lose a lot of money.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Well, we have been drenched.
A:	Oh
B:	We have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the, uh, weather people down here really confused.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	Uh, we,
B:	it's probably,
B:	it, it's just,
A:	It's usually dry down there, isn't it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right now,
B:	by now it's usually,
B:	no,
B:	you know, it's quit raining, you know, by at least a month.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's still,
B:	we're still having April showers, for June.
A:	Oh, I hope they come, this way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I don't know where, where it came from
B:	but it's been really,
B:	we got a lot of, uh,
B:	we're in central Texas
B:	and it feels like we live in Houston.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it, it, you know,
B:	like it rained today
B:	and then it just kind of steamed everything up, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system,
B:	We've had some with really, really high winds that have trashed trees and, everything else.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	It's just,
A:	Now see, every, everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I hope you get some of that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We got enough.
B:	We have had plenty,
B:	and we're still, uh, forecast for more.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, gee,
B:	So,
A:	uh, does is California getting rain then?
B:	Uh, I'm not real sure.
B:	I think a lot of this is coming out of,
B:	I think what's of
B:	it's coming out of Canada,
A:	Out of the Gulf?
B:	and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf.
A:	Oh.
B:	And it's just causing chaos
A:	Yeah.
B:	so it's been, it's been, uh, wet.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we've moved our yard I think three or four times in the last two or three weeks.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	I mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
B:	and, and one, one week it just rained, thunderstormed for a day straight
B:	and you couldn't get out there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You just couldn't get out there.
B:	By the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink, we were, you know,
B:	yeah,
B:	lawn mower broke
B:	So,
A:	Oh, well, see, now we need,
A:	we could use two days straight of rain.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's really drying up, up here.
B:	Well, what always works for me is if I water my plants or we wash the car, it usually rains.
B:	If not that night, the next day
A:	Does it?
A:	I was telling everyone, hang your clothes out on the line
A:	and it's surely going to rain.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um,
A:	We've had real hot weather.
B:	Hotter than usual?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yes.
A:	We, you know,
A:	and, uh, let me think.
A:	I got out of school in May.
A:	In March I was wearing shorts.
B:	Wow.
A:	I was wearing shorts in March up at college,
A:	and, uh, we,
A:	what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring.
B:	Huh.
A:	Is what they said what happened.
B:	Huh.
A:	I hope that,
A:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	But,
A:	I hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter.
B:	No.
B:	I wouldn't think so.
B:	I wouldn't,
B:	not as early as it came.
B:	I mean your talking September, maybe.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's a little early.
B:	Still the,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was wearing shorts in March.
A:	You know it was nippy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, like it was still in the seventies.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, high sixties low seventies in March.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And we were there, we were in New Jersey last October
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it was hotter there than it was here.
A:	Yes.
B:	It was just like a heat wave.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we haven't,
B:	and we just died.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	It was really hot,
B:	so. But I like it here.
A:	Huh.
B:	I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it for snow any day.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	See I like, I like the snow
A:	but I like to watch it fall,
A:	and I just like it where it's deep enough, you know, but not too deep.
B:	Right.
B:	And I can handle a vacation in it
B:	and, you know, but my husband is from New Jersey
B:	and he wouldn't go back either.
B:	He did all the, shoveling and everything else.
A:	Really?
B:	He said it was a pain.
B:	So,
A:	Well, isn't it weird at Christmas time without snow?
B:	No.
B:	I don't think so.
B:	Well, see last year we had snow at Christmas time.
A:	Oh.
B:	So it really wasn't, it was weird because we had snow
B:	It's like, wow, it actually fell on the right day.
B:	So, uh, no,
B:	it's not.
B:	In fact, uh, you know, we're used to running around in, you know, spring clothes in December,
B:	and so when it throws in a real cool winter, we get broken pipes and, and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is, just isn't built for you know, real cold weather for long periods of time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's real dry down there.
A:	You don't have the humidity either, do you?
B:	No,
B:	not, not were we are.
B:	Now in Houston and stuff they've got it, they've got it where no hairsprayer works.
B:	It's so humid at times,
B:	but here it's, it's just about right.
B:	It's, it's pretty dry and, not too dry where, you know you just, it hurts to breathe,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we're just about right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We're just having this, all this rain,
B:	and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable.
B:	Made it, the humidity real high.
A:	Yeah,
A:	muggy, huh?
B:	But no,
B:	I like it.
B:	Well, we're right in a good stop because we're, you know, we get over in the, over the hundreds in the summer,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's, it's not, it's a dry heat
B:	and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity, ninety percent humidity,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so.
A:	See that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real, you know, hundred and the high nineties, we have the humidity to go with it,
B:	Oh.
A:	so you're like real mucky
A:	and you, you know,
A:	your legs stick together just from walking you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know what,
A:	So, um,
B:	So we like it where we're at.
B:	If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So. But no,
B:	it's interesting when it gets really cold here
B:	and people forget that they're, live in Texas
B:	and they don't know how to drive in snow
B:	and, you know. But, uh, I wouldn't trade it for anything
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	I was born in Texas
B:	and I visited other areas,
B:	and I'm just a sun person I think.
B:	I've gotten used to it.
A:	Well, I don't know
A:	Well, I guess that's really about all.
B:	Yeah,
B:	weather is not real hard to talk about
B:	It doesn't last real long either.
B:	I thought the weather is the last thing you talk about,
B:	but in this case it's the only thing to talk about.
B:	But, well, Michelle, it's great talking to,
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, the last movie that I have seen,
A:	it's been, it's been a couple of months.
A:	I saw, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and FLATLINERS.
B:	Yes,
B:	I saw that one.
A:	Those were the last two that I've seen.
B:	What was the second one?
A:	FLATLINERS.
B:	I didn't see that one.
A:	Oh.
B:	Did you see those because of, uh, Julia Roberts, or for, uh, the subject matter of the two?
A:	Oh, it was just,
A:	well, someone had,
A:	I had seen the advertisement for FLATLINERS on T V,
A:	and I thought I'd like it,
A:	and then, uh, one of my friends who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, and she told me to go.
A:	It was good.
A:	So that's why I saw that one.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Well, I've, uh,
B:	I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
B:	and I, um, I've seen, uh, well , just recently, um, WHAT ABOUT BOB?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't gotten to see you know, any real recent ones.
A:	I like comedies better than I do dramas.
B:	I, uh, am not one for the, uh,
B:	I don't need the suspense movies or the, the movies with lots of, uh, the horror movies with, uh, trying to shake you out of your chair.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?
B:	Um, I'm not sure
B:	I, uh, I saw it and, uh, because my wife wanted to see it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise,
B:	and having gone, uh,
B:	well, it really wasn't on a theme that I was, uh, uh, that into,
B:	or, as I say, I prefer the light movies that, uh,
B:	my style of entertainment is, is comedy, uh, primarily and then into action films.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	well, I didn't care for the movie myself.
B:	What?
A:	I didn't really care for the movie either.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you kind of have to like to be, uh, drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Well, okay,
A:	on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN?
B:	Uh, yes.
A:	Do you enjoy that one?
B:	Uh, it was interesting,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	well, I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, um, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
A:	Oh, I haven't even heard of that one.
B:	Well, that was one where, uh,
B:	it's kind of like,
B:	to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN.
B:	The, the story line, um,
B:	if you accept a few of the basic starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.
B:	Uh, it was hard to accept that, uh, this, uh, multimillionaire wheeler dealer would, uh, would, you know, find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, I really liked PRETTY WOMAN.
A:	You know, I just,
A:	well, you just kind of went with it.
A:	Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, FLATLINERS, now, it's a drama,
A:	and I don't usually like them,
A:	and I really enjoyed it.
A:	I, um, I don't know,
A:	it was kind of,
A:	it made you think a lot I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did you see GHOST?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay,
A:	now, did you care for that one?
B:	Uh, that was,
B:	I enjoyed that one.
B:	I, in that I, I guess I, I hate to be too surprised in a movie,
B:	and in that one you could, you could pretty well guess where it was, going to end up.
B:	You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,
B:	but you knew where it would end up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, now, I didn't,
A:	I thought it was an okay movie,
A:	but it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I didn't think so, um,
A:	I really didn't care for the ending of it.
A:	I thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen,
A:	when, you know,
A:	but, um, I don't know, you know.
A:	Well, of course, uh, a bunch of girls had told me and warned me,
A:	and they said, "Oh, it's a real tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da.
A:	Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said well, when are you, when are you supposed to start crying, you know
B:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't really, Uh, I didn't really find it to be a tearjerker
B:	Well, whenever she starts crying
B:	Well, do you go to many movies more than once?
A:	Um, if I see them more than once, I see them on video.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But like you said, I, I enjoy the comedies a lot better.
A:	In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, these days it's, uh,
A:	You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.
B:	Well, if you don't, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, uh, left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, unless a movie is popular and stays around, uh, you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So we have, um,
B:	well, I think just most people have V C R now
B:	and we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No,
A:	I saw one, it was a drama also,
A:	and I can't think of the name of it now, that, um,
A:	it was a book before it came out in a movie,
A:	and it was, it it was a drama.
B:	Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES?
A:	I wanted to see that.
A:	I didn't get to.
B:	I, at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in a, in a longer version even though it was a long movie.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	It's sort of the uncut version.
B:	At least that was some of the rumors.
B:	We'll have to see, because it's, uh, there was some talk about that.
B:	I,
B:	maybe it will come out this fall.
B:	There,
B:	we're sort of in the middle of the summer, um, season of a lot of new movies coming out,
B:	but then there's these, um, periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again, it, uh, will increase the revenues from the movie.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, um, what movies are showing down there now?
B:	Oh, I, I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.
B:	My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them, uh,
B:	I keep track of them a little,
B:	but, you know, ask me to name the ten that are out there right now,
B:	and I'd have to say, uh, I, uh, I don't know.
B:	I, I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's pretty much what I do.
A:	I, I know for sure that that one about,
A:	what was that one about Bob?
B:	Uh, it's kind of, WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB?
A:	I think it's just,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it's just playing now up here.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because some of them, they, uh, they'll start in one area of the country,
B:	and if they it's,
A:	or radio heard faintly in Okay.
A:	I, I guess first of all I'll just say we haven't done much, uh, gardening.
A:	We do lawn work all the time.
A:	But, uh, our gardening we lost,
A:	remember the last two freezes,
A:	I don't know how long you've been here
B:	Yeah
B:	I do
A:	But we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones.
A:	And so, as far as our bushes, we don't have any
A:	but we do have some blackberry bushes.
A:	And  and they were really hearty and stayed on
B:	Oh, really.
A:	and we've done really well with them.
B:	Did you plant those yourself?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so they've been really good
A:	and the kids, I had to,
A:	the first year I had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries.
A:	But, uh, we go out,
A:	it, it's hard to go out when it's this hot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but, uh, keep the weeds out of them and, and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them.
A:	And they're okay.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	That's nice.
B:	I, I love blackberries
B:	and we, uh,
B:	when I was smaller, we, my family lived in Tennessee
B:	and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick, my brother and I.
B:	But, I don't have any down here.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, we have some flowers that have,
A:	they're just are real hearty also,
A:	and they're bold
A:	and they come up every year
A:	but, uh, they're getting too thick,
A:	I need to go thin them out.
A:	I don't know what kind of flowers they are.
A:	They're real common around here.
A:	They're, they're orange
A:	and they look like a lily, sort of.
B:	Oh, I think I know what they,
B:	I can't remember what the name of them are either.
A:	No,
A:	but I think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in.
A:	They, they keep the, the rain on the outside, little rain drops
B:	Oh.
A:	and, and they look real pretty after the rain.
A:	And so I really like them
A:	but I need to get out and, and, um, do that.
A:	Now as far as our grass, it grows crazy here.
A:	It just keeps growing and growing
A:	and sometimes my son does it.
A:	But it just is,
A:	I don't, I don't know.
A:	I've lived in Utah my whole life
A:	and we can't seem to get ours green.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Down here, the grass?
A:	Yeah
B:	Well, I'm,
B:	we've had problems with our yard.
B:	We,
B:	it was one big weed is what it was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was just horrible.
B:	And my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
B:	and we have this God awful ugly thing.
B:	And   and I know they must think, you know, I wish those people would do something about their yard.
A:	Crappy I know,
A:	we have that too.
B:	But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that, that seems to be helping
B:	and he put it on the front yard to see how, you know, it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we've got a Great Dane in the back
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she has eaten everything I have put out there.
B:	She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees.
A:	Oh dear.
B:	I know,
B:	and she's eaten the bushes.
B:	I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there
A:	No.
B:	and I barricaded it up, so she couldn't get into it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I went and took a shower and looked back out there
B:	and she was already in it.
B:	And I was so mad.
A:	Had somehow gotten in.
B:	So I can't do anything back
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I've tried out in the front
B:	but like you said that, that freeze that came.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had some bushes that, uh, some shrubs I put out front
B:	and it killed those too.
B:	So, I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing.
B:	I just don't even want to do anything.
A:	The, the other problem that we have,
A:	well it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived
A:	and so I, I don't know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that happened to us.
B:	We have these,
A:	So like I wanted to go out and kill them too.
B:	I know.
A:	They had no right to live.
A:	But anyway, uh, under our trees we get a, a north sun
A:	and, uh, the,
A:	it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them.
B:	Oh, I know.
B:	Ours don't.
A:	And we just can't grow, uh, grass underneath there.
B:	I know,
B:	we can't either.
B:	But I've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. Uh, you know one on either side of the yard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and they're big
B:	and they're real full and everything, you know, in the summer time
B:	but it, it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree
A:	Yeah.
B:	but toward the end of the summer, you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing.
B:	But, by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops.
B:	You know, it's, it's  it's a never ending cycle.
A:	Right.
A:	It's a vicious cycle, isn't it?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is.
A:	It just really,
B:	So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot.
B:	So,
A:	Well, I don't,
A:	we've never done anything like this
A:	but we've been thinking, you know, if we built up, uh, you know, either a wood, wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers, or, or some new bushes in there that would live.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I think that we're going to try that.
B:	Huh.
A:	I, I think the I think that's pretty much what we have decided.
A:	Now I have two long windows
B:	Yeah.
B:	Really
B:	well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front
B:	and they've got mini-blinds and stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But only, only one is really like in the flower bed part
B:	and the other one is out on the porch.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So there's not really much I can do about that.
A:	That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows.
A:	One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son
A:	and one is, uh, an office that my husband and I work in.
A:	And so, I, I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that,
A:	well, the flowers are out by the back of the house,
A:	so, and that's why the front room is.
A:	So that's not too bad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I like to look at the flowers.
A:	They're pretty.
B:	I do too,
B:	that's why I look at my neighbors yard
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't have anything to look at
B:	so I look at theirs.
A:	But it's funny because, uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, anyway I do, to do our yard
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours  to them
B:	Yeah
A:	or and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back
A:	and
B:	Yeah.
B:	It, it's really a pain.
B:	My husband works a lot
B:	so, um, a lot,
A:	It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work.
B:	Yeah
B:	I'm,
B:	it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard
B:	and and I just I really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else.
B:	I hate to mow that yard.
A:	I know.
A:	It is, it's not my favorite, thing in the world either.
A:	I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well mine's getting there.
B:	He helps,
B:	he does half
B:	and I do half,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	Well that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out, outside,
B:	Oh sure I'll be more then glad to pay him  if he'd just go out there and do it and, and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it.
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
B:	That, that's my only thing with him.
A:	Exactly.
B:	That's why I'm help, having him help me now fade at end of
A:	Okay,
A:	well, some of the things I like to do are,
A:	I like to knit.
A:	I knit sometimes,
A:	and I sew
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I like to sew sometimes for my kids.
A:	I, I sew clothes for them every once in a while.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I make quilts.
B:	Oh, wow,
B:	that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do.
B:	I do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery
B:	and I'm, I'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch.
B:	I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt.
A:	After a while, cross stitch, I
A:	I don't know.
A:	I have to put it away
B:	It gets boring.
A:	and then I have to bring it back.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know. And, and, uh, I don't know why that is.
A:	I don't know if it's looking at the little things every time.
B:	Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that might be it.
B:	But I do a lot of it in the car.
A:	That might
A:	and yet, there's,
B:	We,
A:	Oh, do you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we commute from Plano to Dallas
A:	Oh.
B:	so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done
B:	and I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car.
A:	Oh, I bet.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know that I could even think about quilting.
B:	You have to have a pretty good frame, don't you, to do any kind of quilting work?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I've not really done any, too much challenging, uh, stuff.
A:	I, I can do it with a, a needle and thread you know, but, uh, and get about five small stitches in, which is pretty good,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's very long.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time
B:	Oh, I bet.
A:	So, uh,
B:	But, it's such a lost art.
A:	So, uh, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's so much easier.
B:	Yes.
A:	But, uh, the other ones are very pretty.
A:	They're, uh,
A:	we have a quilt on our bed that's,
A:	instead of, like, yarn they tied, uh, ribbon into it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	And it's real pretty.
B:	I bet.
A:	It's real pretty.
B:	There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.
B:	She had crocheted a full bedspread.
B:	It's kind of a hobnail looking thing.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long time I think oh, why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now did you say you could knit?
B:	No.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Haven't tried that either.
A:	Well, I was going to say because, Because if you could knit, you could crochet.
B:	I want to learn to crochet.
B:	I,
B:	Really?
A:	It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the, the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then you just use your right hand with the hook.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's not,
A:	it's really not too difficult.
A:	You could learn that, I'm sure and pick that up.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's not too difficult.
B:	It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle.
A:	Yeah
B:	But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine.
B:	I never learned,
B:	and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me.
A:	Isn't that interesting.
B:	But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew.
A:	I think that's really interesting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	And yet, you know, I think about, you know,
A:	you said you do a lot of needlework
A:	and, and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns that people do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, I just think that, uh, that's one of, one of the arts that I think are really pretty.
A:	And a lot of people don't do that either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, and so,
B:	Well, it's hard to find the time.
B:	I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or just not sitting down at all
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	You know, and, and I always think, well, I can do this and watch T V or something you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it seems like I always get my mind carried away to something else
A:	and then it doesn't quite work
B:	Well, it,
A:	or,
B:	I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary.
B:	It's so I find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework
B:	and I get frustrated doing that
B:	so Just give it up.
A:	And, you know, I like to sketch.
A:	I can, I can sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that
B:	Ooh.
A:	and that's nice and everything,
A:	but, you know, it's funny,
A:	I can't I can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wish I could.
A:	And, and yet I can't do, you know, like, like, uh, craft, uh, on wood.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can't do that painting thing.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And yet,
B:	I'm the same way.
B:	If I see something, I can copy it,
B:	but I certainly can't create.
B:	I admire people that have that in their minds already.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me, too.
A:	Me, too.
A:	I know a woman who's just wonderful at that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I look at it
A:	and, you know, you look at those things
A:	and you wish so badly that you could do them.
A:	I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn.
A:	I guess that's the only way I could do it.
B:	Well, sometimes, even with that. I, I think you have to have some,
A:	Okay,
A:	what kind of fishing do you do?
B:	Well, mostly, uh, a, a little fresh water fish,
B:	but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, down here I haven't fished much in Texas.
A:	That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout.
B:	Oh, they're really not,
B:	I think they're good to eat.
A:	What, what kind of bait do you use to catch them?
B:	Oh, just, usually worms, night crawlers.
B:	Sometimes fish eggs.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Sometimes
A:	Fish eggs?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
A:	Huh.
B:	Just little, just little fish eggs.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook
B:	and it will stay relatively well
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
B:	Yeah
A:	That's a great way.
B:	and, and they really like that.
A:	I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,
B:	Now I have never caught catfish.
A:	personally I like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because they fight the best
A:	But a, a catfish will really just tear into anything like that, like liver or, uh, cheese or anything that smells terrible
B:	Oh, is that right?
B:	Now in Amarillo did you fish any of this ?
A:	Uh, no.
A:	Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma
A:	and they have the, uh, Lake Texoma right next to them.
A:	So the,
A:	we used to catch some, uh, sand bass off Lake, there's a Roosevelt Bridge
A:	and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up, you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and the fish would be sitting at different levels.
B:	Oh, how about that.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	you just leave it at that level
A:	and in no time something would hit it
A:	and you could pull them up two and three times in a row,
A:	but you had to find out what level, how many cranks they were off the bottom.
A:	And if you left it on the bottom, there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, of course, depending on how big your bait was, uh, you know, would be depending on what you caught.
B:	Oh, I think that is really interesting.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that was a lot of fun.
A:	My grandfather used to do that
A:	and we used to have a light at the top of the water.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He'd really spoiled me in that respect.
B:	I think they're,
B:	see, and I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here.
B:	I guess it would,
B:	if you did it like you were just, uh, saying, that's pretty much like rainbow trout.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You bait the hook,
B:	you throw it in,
B:	you troll it a little bit
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you wait
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they troll it a little bit.
A:	Well, if you,
A:	do you have any friends with ponds?
B:	No.
B:	I don't
A:	I, uh,
A:	well, if you can
A:	well, or even a lake.
A:	If, uh,
A:	seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and, uh, bring it in to you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat.
A:	You, you want to make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a, a regular animal or, or fish uh, well, you know, something coming off from the bank like they usually do
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you don't have to really get, uh, fish from a boat, you know, because they're actually right there at the shore.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms,
A:	but, uh, if,
A:	I am now
B:	You are now.
A:	Oh, yeah
B:	I've never used those.
B:	That's really interesting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It just, uh, just a slow reel
A:	and then let it sit on the bottom,
A:	but the key is to always have your line tight.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And that way you can feel when they're hitting it,
A:	and believe me you'll know the difference.
B:	Uh, what kind of fish do you like the best to eat?
A:	Oh, crappie actually.
B:	Oh, do you
A:	Yeah
A:	I've been fishing in the, the ocean.
A:	We're about three hours from the ocean.
A:	And I also like Spanish mackerel.
A:	And you catch blues
A:	and, uh, that's a different kind of fishing off the pier, too.
A:	Have you ever fished off the pier?
B:	I've done fishing like that
B:	but, but, uh, tell me what, uh, where you'd catch crappie.
B:	My, my neighbor has gone before and, and done that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but,
A:	Oh, the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and, and jigs.
A:	Uh, they have like yellow, uh, fuzz on a hook, you know, that kind of comes out.
B:	Oh, oh, I know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, they're sort of like, well, I want to say flies,
B:	but not exactly like,
A:	Yeah,
A:	get,
A:	but they're a little heavier
A:	and they're bigger.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Get the yellow ones.
B:	The yellow.
A:	Those are the ticket
B:	Okay
A:	And let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a, a kind of a slow reel.
A:	You don't even have to have a good rod or anything. Just, just even a regular line
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you throw it out
A:	and, uh, the, the other thing that's real good is small, uh,
A:	it's a real small rapalla .
A:	It's about an inch and a half long
A:	and they're pure all silver, something real shiny about that long.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They'll go after that in a heartbeat also. Just anything that really shines or spins.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my mom, she just loves to fish
B:	and she has a lot of those, those little, uh,
B:	they almost look neon.
B:	You know, they're just real colorful things on, onto her end.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And she she's really a good fisher woman.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's neat.
B:	Well, you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too.
B:	Hi, Clarice.
B:	Um, have you had a family reunion recently?
A:	Yes,
A:	just this last summer we went back to Utah,
A:	and we met, it was my,
A:	we usually go to my family reunion,
A:	but this one was my husband's
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're usually quite similar, I think.
B:	Are you both from Utah originally?
A:	No,
A:	he's from here
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, most of his people are from Oregon,
A:	so we kind of met halfway
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so, this was one,
A:	and they, um, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, you know,
B:	Oh, how nice.
A:	things like that have to be planned,
A:	like they had planned
A:	that, we went to the reunion in end of June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January to reserve that.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure,
B:	Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles like that or his immediate family?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	this was everybody.
B:	Oh wow,
B:	how many people were there?
A:	Oh, I, oh, I, jeez, I think over, um, three hundred were there.
B:	Wow.
A:	It was quite a large
B:	Wow.
A:	it was a great big lodge,
A:	and so we had plenty of room and everything,
A:	and some of them live in that area,
A:	so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, that was a great big thing,
A:	and we do that with his family about every five years,  a great big one.
A:	And then like immediate family we do, like we try to do one thing once a year.
B:	Now how many, how many people are in his immediate family?
A:	Well, he has eight brothers and sisters
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	so that's big by itself.
B:	Wow,
B:	it really is,
B:	and you get together once a year.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wow,
A:	So we have a little shindig with them.
B:	Are they all here in the area,
B:	or are they scattered?
A:	Um they're close, in a close proximity.
A:	Um, let's see,
A:	there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, um, the others live in close neighboring, um, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	yeah
B:	Oh wow,
B:	that's wonderful.
A:	so, it's been fun.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, we don't really get together,
B:	I, I would love to,
B:	and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime.
B:	Um, I have a sister in Colorado, and, uh, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas.
B:	So we're kind of scattered right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, my, my cousins have a, you know, they put on a family reunion, um, once a year,
B:	but it's always like the second week in September,
B:	so it's,
B:	the kids are already back in school
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so, and that's back in the
A:	That's hard.
B:	and that's in New York,
B:	and there's no way, I mean there's just no possible way.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it's not really a weekend,
B:	it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, you know, um,
B:	my family moved to Connecticut,
B:	the rest of the family stayed in New York and, uh, on Long Island,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so, they're all kind of local and close,
B:	and so they just have a, you know, a day picnic,
B:	and, uh, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing
A:	Yeah.
B:	that would be so wonderful
A:	It really is fun,
A:	and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	once a year, um, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing.
A:	You can come and go as you please type thing.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	And they do that once a year.
A:	I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad,
A:	but you can't go every year,
A:	you just cannot do that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	And do they, they have a hotel,
B:	or where do you stay?
A:	Um, basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters.
A:	There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out.
B:	Take everybody,
B:	yeah.
A:	Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them,
A:	like I go stay with my mother,
A:	and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And so it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	so that's not hard,
A:	but the real planning, that's the real key
B:	Oh, that sounds so wonderful,
B:	isn't that nice.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they send out,
A:	my mom's family now,
A:	this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,
A:	but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year,
A:	and that's how they divide it up
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But then one brother and sister from each family.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and each one of them take their turn.
B:	Oh, wow,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And then the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is her children help her,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing.
B:	Oh, I see, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, wow,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, um, the thing is, that, um, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out,
A:	and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making,
A:	Okay.
A:	What do you think of the public school system?
A:	First off, do you have children that are in it?
B:	I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems
B:	and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,  system
A:	Oh, okay
B:	So,
A:	Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now.
A:	I now have grandchildren,  in the school system
B:	Oh.
A:	so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now,  with it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	So what do you think?
B:	Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job.
B:	I think they have a long way to go yet
B:	but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.
B:	You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,
B:	and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.
B:	And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.
A:	Right.
B:	you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.
B:	And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,
B:	they literally cannot come in out of the rain.
A:	That's right
B:	You know, and that just,
B:	I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.
B:	So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,
B:	and I think that's very, very important.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
A:	I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren,
A:	we have a, uh, fourth grader
A:	and then we have one that's in kindergarten
A:	and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade
B:	and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my Algebra Two, when I was in high school.
A:	Is that scary?
B:	And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, so they're really, they're really moving them along
B:	but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life.
A:	Now,
B:	And that's you know,
B:	a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.
A:	Yes.
B:	And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.
A:	Correct.
A:	Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?
A:	Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.
B:	Yes,
B:	that's a,
A:	And, and
A:	are you, do you find that?
B:	Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,  things so that they compare
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.
B:	And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,  you know, that I think it's, uh, I think it's crazy personally
A:	Be,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, the the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review
B:	but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,  October. So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States.
A:	Coming up,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And I think that's totally useless.
B:	I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
B:	but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.
B:	It's like bragging on your grandchildren.
A:	Right
B:	You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
B:	and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,
B:	and that's great.
B:	But that's what they're doing with the school systems
B:	and they're wasting too much time on that, I think.
A:	Well, I, I know that this again this, this friend, uh, is in the Plano School District,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she teaches, uh, uh, it uh, emotionally disturbed children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she says she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade.
B:	Yes.
A:	But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something.
A:	I didn't quite understand it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there's a,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, uh,
B:	The bottom line is always money,
A:	Laurie?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay.
A:	I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your credit cards
A:	and I'm supposed to compare those with my, my habits.
B:	Okay.
B:	How do I make use of credit cards?
A:	Yes.
B:	Um, let's see.
B:	I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash.
A:	Right.
B:	And I I,
B:	do you work for Texas Instruments?
A:	No,
A:	I do not.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and those are only available at T I.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money
B:	so I'm always using credit cards.
A:	Sure.
A:	Well, myself I always,
A:	I'm, I'm a traveling person
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'm out of town quite a bit
A:	so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me too.
A:	So that's, uh,
A:	as far as using them outside that I'm not, I don't use them too much
A:	but I, I think my wife is sort of like you
A:	she uses a credit card,  most of the time.
B:	Yeah
A:	So she does most of the shopping for our household
A:	so she'll use them more than I will.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	But do you get to pay the bills?
A:	Yes.
B:	Same at my house
A:	So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's
A:	and I'll go in and charge something
A:	and I'll have to give them my driver's license.
A:	They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, you know, primarily work type things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	This is my first call by the way,
A:	so
B:	Oh, it's mine too.
A:	Oh, is it really?
B:	Yes.
A:	All right
A:	so we're both beginners then.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've had this for a couple weeks
A:	and I've been out of town
A:	so this is my first time to,  to use it.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	So,
B:	Now, did you pick this topic
B:	or were you given?
A:	No,
A:	I was given this topic.
B:	I see.
B:	Okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they give you, they assign you a topic,
A:	you call the eight hundred number,
B:	Right.
A:	Have you tried it yet?
B:	No
A:	Okay.
A:	When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, uh, pretty, uh, cut and dried
B:	Huh,
B:	okay.
B:	Um, let's see.
B:	So how long are we supposed to talk for?
A:	I'm not sure.
A:	A couple,
A:	about two three minutes I think.
B:	Okay.
A:	But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards.
A:	I,
A:	one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Definitely.
A:	like years ago my wife and I got married
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit
A:	and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that.
B:	Oh.
B:	That will cost you a fortune.
A:	That was like thirty years ago
A:	so now it's a little different.
A:	We,
A:	I get a bill
A:	and I'll pay it the same day it comes
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest
A:	so they should follow the same rule.
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, yeah,
A:	Oh, you bet it's
A:	it's an absolute savings.
B:	Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in,  you get to keep the money.
A:	You bet.
A:	That's, that's very handy.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It works great.
A:	Well, I think that's all I have.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, it was nice to meet you.
A:	Nice to meet you
A:	and, uh, give it a try.
A:	I think you'll enjoy it.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	Thanks.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.
B:	Do you?
B:	Why?
A:	Why?
A:	Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.
B:	You think the problem is not enough doctors?
A:	I think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your uh, I mean, on your liability.
B:	Gosh, for one thing.
A:	Oh?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you think there are plenty of doctors?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I don't think there is a shortage of doctors
B:	and I do know that O B, which is my field the doctors' health the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's astronomical.
B:	Now they can't doing anything about that.
B:	I don't think they're in a conspiracy.
B:	I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.
A:	No,
A:	people don't sue
B:	People are very sue, sue conscious.
A:	lawyers sue.
A:	If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's probably true, too.
B:	But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.
A:	Well, sure.
B:	And, so,
A:	But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.
A:	You know what tort theory is?
B:	No.
A:	Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, it, uh,
A:	an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.
B:	That's right.
A:	If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.
B:	Well,
A:	If, if they have complications and,
B:	It depends.
A:	Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,
A:	but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.
B:	Well, that's true,
B:	they are because doctors are performing many more tests.
B:	Many of them are unnecessary,
B:	they are doing so many C sections just to prevent.
A:	Just to prevent a a law suit.
B:	Because they have all these monitors now
B:	and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, I believe that there, there is a system already in place for health care.
B:	So, it's terrible.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they have indigent health care.
A:	You show up at Parkland bleeding
B:	You'll get it.
B:	That's true.
B:	In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we have that happen.
B:	We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and at the last minute, they come to us.
B:	Well uh, we can't turn them away.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	So,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm for that.
B:	I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,
B:	so I'd like to wipe them all out
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I, I happen to know a few
A:	and I even claim one as a friend.
A:	He's a divorce attorney.
A:	But,
B:	He better not be mine
A:	I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.
A:	But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	some they do.
A:	Uh, he just said,
B:	They stop their O B at least.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever.
B:	Right,
B:	Right.
A:	His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.
B:	That's incredible.
A:	And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And most of them are very sincere.
B:	Most of them do the best they can.
A:	Yeah
B:	They are human.
B:	Occasionally something will go wrong.
B:	Well, you can be human and Catholic.
A:	I know you can be human and Catholic,
A:	but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no
A:	I mean,
B:	most of them do.
B:	I really believe that.
B:	From dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious.
A:	Well, you know, who is getting rich?
A:	Insurance companies.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they are.
A:	You know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance,
A:	say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
A:	or,
B:	Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program.
B:	I'm a graduate student,
B:	and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.
B:	Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,
B:	so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming
B:	and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.
B:	But, um.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and and it's least hard on your body,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and there's and there's no jarring on the.
A:	I,
B:	Pardon?
A:	It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
B:	Exactly, yeah,
B:	um,
A:	and
B:	yeah,
B:	fluid resistance.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week,
A:	but it's not enough to,
A:	boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore,
B:	or do you enjoy it?
A:	I like it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like it, uh,
A:	part of my problem is I have small children,
A:	so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
A:	Of course, you got a little different direction going,
A:	but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds,
B:	and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um,
B:	so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college,
B:	and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly,
B:	and so I got my weight down,
B:	and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
A:	Right,
A:	you don't notice it  as much,
B:	, yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it
B:	and,
A:	You feel it, don't you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes,
A:	and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years,
A:	but, uh, it's changed places
A:	And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh,
A:	in Texas, uh, does
A:	there, probably quite a few facilities.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there are.
B:	Um, I'm living in a dorm right now,
B:	and so right downstairs there's a facility.
B:	And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
A:	Do you enjoy it,
A:	or is it, uh.
A:	If you can have, find the time it's just the.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	yeah,
B:	I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while,
B:	but that's hard, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is hard
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it is hard.
A:	It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
B:	Exactly.
A:	Don't get enough sleep as it is,
A:	right
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, kind of have,
A:	if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of,
A:	course it's really, you know,
A:	as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You feel invigorated
A:	and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	ready to go another twelve hours.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
A:	I do.
A:	I have to be real careful.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
A:	Did you?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	completely.
B:	I mean, any kind of meat
B:	or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
A:	Makes a lot of difference.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really does.
A:	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
A:	Right.
B:	and so. I found that really helps.
A:	And unless you really like, uh, fish.
A:	Fish is pretty good for you,
A:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I eat that,
B:	I think I've eaten fish like twice since.
B:	I used to eat a lot of fish, too,
B:	but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
A:	Kind of see what happens.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I like it.
A:	I've tried to do that with sugar
B:	I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
A:	everything has sugar in it .
A:	I mean, if you go,
A:	your ketchup has sugar in it.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Course,
A:	and I like sugar, too,
A:	that's that's a problem,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but.
A:	Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you.
A:	Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
B:	Okay,
B:	yeah,
B:	it sounds good.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
A:	Well, you, too.
A:	Good luck, uh,
A:	enjoy college while you can.
A:	Let me tell you it's, uh.
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now.
B:	I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
A:	It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	Well, it's good talking,
A:	Where are you going studying?
B:	Pardon?
B:	I'm studying speech pathology.
A:	Right.
A:	do you see as, uh, the changes that have occurred in the last ,
A:	Beverly.
B:	I think one of the thing that I notice a lot,
B:	I know it's touching social changes,
B:	but, uh, to me what becomes socially acceptable,
B:	and I, I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction,
B:	but I notice things on T V being more, um, open, more I believe, uh,
B:	they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago,
B:	and, you know, and specifically, nudity, things like that, uh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I, I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V
B:	and nobody will think anything of it,
B:	and to me that's surprising.
B:	To me, that's, that's a big change to accept it,
B:	and it comes across, I think subtly, you know, a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, you know, when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much.
B:	That's one of the biggest ones I've seen.
A:	Huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's a big one.
B:	What about you?
A:	Well, I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions.
A:	Somebody else, uh, made them do it.
A:	Uh, that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, uh, no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices.
A:	It's rather, sue these guys because they made a uh, a seat belt that didn't work right
A:	or uh, that's what I think is a big one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I tend to agree with you,
B:	and I think there's a lot of that.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	we have become lawsuit happy.
B:	Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get.
B:	Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, um, oh, you know, the, the, the era we went through that was like, you know, hey if it makes you happy, do it.
B:	You know, kind of like, disregard to others,
B:	do what makes you happy,
B:	and, and yes,
B:	we should take care of ourselves, you know,
B:	and we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others.
B:	Um, I don't know,
B:	I think it's come to that a lot.
B:	I see it a lot in my daughter.
B:	I have a four year old.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through,
B:	but whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that,
B:	you made me do this,
B:	and so I try to tell her, , everything isn't always somebody else's fault.
B:	You know, you have to watch where you're going
B:	and and so it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, uh, the roles that men and women play.
A:	That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly.
B:	Um, in your opinion, good or bad, or both?
A:	Well, both, you know,
A:	there's some great things that, uh, have come about with more equality,
A:	but I think that also,
A:	I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us.
B:	I do too.
B:	I think part of that,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like, in terms of their self confidence, their self worth, you know, I can do something,
B:	I can be somebody, you know,
B:	if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too.
B:	And I think that's good,
B:	but, um, I think when you push, you know, maybe I think when that was first trying come about with, you know, what we know as the women's lib movement
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it was too extreme.
B:	Um, I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, you know,
B:	and I think there's definite roles,
B:	and I think, you know, part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of the, the, the social changes,
B:	I don't know,
B:	the fact that, uh, during their early changes where, you know, women did come more, speak, maybe speak out, I was going to say, come more out of themselves,
B:	but speak out,
B:	I think a lot of men were threatened by that.
B:	I think now less men are, you know, because they're used to it,
B:	it's around them.
B:	Um, but I, I don't know,
B:	I, I, I don't know why the families are breaking up.
B:	I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work.
B:	They go in and say, well, hey, you know, I'll stick with it while it's good,
B:	and then I'll get out.
B:	And I, I, I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I would agree with you.
A:	Uh,
A:	What kind of movies have you been seeing lately?
B:	Uh, it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies.
B:	Course, my, my favorite now is, is DANCES WITH WOLVES.
A:	Oh, it's an excellent movie.
B:	Uh, SILENCE OF THE uh, of the LAMBS was good.
A:	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What was that anyway?
B:	Oh, it's a, I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it.
B:	It's with, uh, Jodie Foster.
A:	Okay.
B:	And it, uh, it's pretty good.
B:	Another one that I think I really liked was, uh, THE FISHER KING.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Let's see,
A:	who was in FISHER KING?
A:	That was, um, Robin Williams
A:	and, uh and, uh, I can't the last name.
B:	Right.
B:	How about you?
B:	What are you?
A:	Uh, we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately.
A:	Um, we really enjoyed, um, DEAD POETS' SOCIETY.
B:	Yes.
A:	Um, several years back one we saw, we saw we really, really enjoyed was, uh, ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, uh, Timothy Hutton and, uh, Mary Tyler Moore,
A:	and, uh, uh, who played the father, anyway
B:	Right.
A:	excellent movie.
B:	That was, that was an excellent movie.
B:	Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?
A:	Yes
A:	we have.
B:	What'd you think of it?
A:	Oh, we loved it.
B:	I don't think I can see it enough times.
A:	I know what you mean.
A:	I know what you mean.
B:	Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done.
A:	Uh, he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD,
A:	but, uh, I mean, you know, basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit.
B:	No,
B:	but you know, it wasn't a bad movie.
A:	Oh, no.
A:	It's a good movie.
B:	It got such bad reviews,
B:	really, and, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B:	But I, then I wasn't expecting any classic either.
A:	Well, um, they did a real good job with it.
B:	I thought so.
A:	Um, they didn't try to make him super human or, you know, invincible.
A:	They just, just,
A:	he worked hard at it.
B:	Have you seen THE FISHER KING?
A:	No
A:	I haven't, not an opportunity to see that, uh,
B:	Uh, it,
B:	you, you know,
B:	I guess it, it really isn't for everybody.
B:	It's, it's pretty deep and, uh, uh, philosophical.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I thought it had a wonderful message to it. It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said, You know, I think I liked that
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, You know, I did like it
A:	Yeah.
B:	But when you first came out, you weren't real sure.
A:	It sounds kind of like one, uh, we saw at home here on the, rented it, um, CLARA'S HEART.
B:	Haven't seen that.
A:	Um, Whoopi Goldberg.
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	I did,
B:	yes,
B:	I did.
A:	And she played a, uh,
A:	the, uh,
A:	she's a housekeeper.
B:	Uh, the nanny type.
A:	Yeah,
A:	she's a housekeeper
A:	she. She was a, oh, now I can't say it, a Haitian.
B:	Housekeeper, uh-huh.
A:	Anyway, she, uh, she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy,
A:	but then again, she's got a whole lot on the ball,
A:	and the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, more than, more than, you know,
A:	it wasn't a mystery,
A:	it wasn't, you know, blood and guts and violence and, and car chases type thing.
A:	It was just a good movie.
B:	I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING.
A:	A KISS BEFORE DYING.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had not heard about it when it was on the movies, but was out on video.
A:	And.
B:	And it's with Sean Young.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it's a, it's a mystery.
B:	It was very predictable,
B:	I mean, you knew, you knew when the murder was going to happen or something,
B:	but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching.
B:	That's right.
B:	I had, uh, uh,
B:	I like the, I think it's called the, uh, RAZOR'S EDGE,
B:	but, no
B:	no,
B:	the JAGGED EDGE,
B:	the JAGGED EDGE  with, uh,
A:	Oh, okay .
B:	All right.
A:	Um, serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it.
B:	Well, what do you think?
B:	Oh.
A:	And, um, I was a teacher for seven years in the public schools,
A:	so I know a little bit about it not, a whole great deal.
B:	Well, tell me about it.
B:	What are,  what are the problems with public education?
A:	Well, um, there, there's some.
A:	There's several
A:	It's such a, a broad, you know, topic that you need to boil it down.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, one that, um, I thought was a problem that , I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, uh, was like bilingual education for, um, different, um, minority groups and like Asians and, um, uh, Mexican Americans and, and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages
B:	Right.
A:	and so most of these children are put in, um, either special ed or a bilingual program, and then for just a small amount of time,
A:	and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the, part of the day,
A:	and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, um, a lot of the money isn't put into that,
A:	and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner
A:	and, um, you know, there's only so long you can do that
B:	Right.
A:	And a lot of the teachers,
A:	it it was not the teacher's fault.
A:	A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children .
B:	Do you find that those parents, um,
B:	I've seen the same thing and heard the same things,
B:	and at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend, you know, that, that time, you know
A:	Yeah.
B:	typically the mother was at home with, uh, the children and,  and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and really society sort of dictates that, uh, you know, both the parents work.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, um, I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the, you know, the second and third grade, uh, if the kids had, you know, proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that, that would make a lot of difference.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, definitely,
A:	definitely.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I work at a university,
B:	and, and it's really tough when we're, uh, uh,
B:	I, I, uh, work at the University of Texas at Dallas
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class, even some who are maybe, you know, in the top ten of their class,
B:	and their S A T scores are very low,
B:	and a lot of it has to do with their, uh, their reading ability, you know,  their, their language
A:	Yeah.
B:	and,
A:	Oh, definitely,
A:	yeah.
B:	It, uh, makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low, they may be, uh, good students,
B:	but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential
B:	and they're going,  to fail unless some sort of remedial, uh, education is given to them
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,  And then it, then it comes into, well, who's supposed to give it to them, the colleges and universities or,  are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and,  the junior highs.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I know Richardson school district has a, has a wonderful program in the remedial reading, um, where, you know, of course, all the children are tested in some, time portion of the year
A:	and, and, uh, some children who need extra help are put into this, um, reading program,
A:	and it is just excellent.
A:	It is,
B:	Yeah
A:	I wish that all the children could be exposed to that program, you know.
A:	And I I know that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in that,
A:	and yet they don't qualify,
A:	but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify, because I think everybody would benefit from these programs.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it sounds like it.
A:	It is excellent
A:	so,
B:	So how many children do you have at home?
A:	I have two little ones
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, you know, I've been teaching since they were, gosh, newborns
A:	and and it just wasn't adding up
A:	and, you know, being a teacher, and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just, you know, don't have the time, time, time, time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It was kind of getting to me, where, where I'm doing the same thing
A:	And so, um, you know, my children are getting older
A:	and I was missing out on a lot,
A:	so I just decided to stay home for a while,
A:	I don't know how long
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Okay, uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I basically read books.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It is,
A:	I do.
A:	Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed,
A:	so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am,
A:	I have about three books that I am going on.
A:	And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one.
A:	But that's just kind of,
B:	Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.
A:	Not always,
A:	just sometimes.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And what what kind of books do you read?
A:	Uh, just really different ones.
A:	Uh, I have one that I was reading on, uh, raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another one on, uh, uh, uh, like a crime story
B:	Oh yeah
A:	A true crime story.
B:	Oh, do you like those detective stories?
A:	Yeah.
A:	But this,
A:	it was a true one.
A:	It was just a little different though.
A:	Reading that one last night.
B:	Oh, well that is interesting.
B:	Actually, I like to read also,
B:	but, uh, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.
A:	Yeah,
A:	like my husband.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	kind of one or the other.
A:	You must, uh, work for T I?
B:	Yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my husband does too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I am a computer scientist.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, I have a lot of other hobbies.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	really.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I am kind of, uh, I guess what you would call it, a project person.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I love,
B:	like I have a shop
B:	and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself
B:	and so, hobby,
B:	it's, it's funny, uh,
B:	from the one stand point, it is work.
B:	But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy to do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	To find broken,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	What kinds of things do you fix?
B:	Well, essentially anything you find in a house. Uh, a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, uh, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.
A:	Oh.
A:	And you have a shop?
B:	Well it, it is not anything elaborate.
B:	It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you can fix just about everything and anything.
B:	Right.
A:	Well, that is great.
B:	And in the car,
B:	I guess the car too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And so, uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.
B:	Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is pretty much like my husband.
A:	He is, he is pretty, uh, mobile in that area too.
A:	He, he works on the cars.
A:	He rarely takes them in
B:	Yeah
B:	I,
A:	and, uh, he works on irons, and all T V and stuff too.
A:	We rarely have to take those things in too.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think it, it,
B:	not only can it be fun,
B:	but it can certainly help your finances.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	definitely.
B:	So, do you have any art, uh, how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies?
A:	Uh. Not really.
A:	I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, uh, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	well that's good.
A:	But, but, uh, not really
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I don't necessarily either.
B:	I can plink out a song or two on a piano
A:	Oh.
B:	and I can, uh,
B:	I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art,
B:	I guess uh, graphic arts is that what they call it,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I can't do any of that,
B:	but sweat shirts is certainly impressive.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I belong to this organization for, uh, if, if you have preschool children
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, uh, section for the moms
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and those are really neat
A:	and we learn to do the, uh, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, those are really neat.
A:	So we learn different crafts like that uh
B:	I see.
B:	Well, that is neat
A:	Yeah.
B:	I guess you could consider that a hobby.
B:	Do you, do you cook for a hobby
B:	or do you,
A:	No
A:	I cook dinner
B:	That's not something you,
A:	I don't consider it a hobby
B:	I understand that.
A:	But, uh, you know, I
A:	no
A:	I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I like to bake off and on.
A:	And usually once a week I will bake something,
A:	but it's not anything elaborate, you know
B:	Right.
A:	At least, I don't think it is.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So,
B:	But, I think that still borders on hobby.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. Uh, on the computer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I have little projects little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, drive my wife crazy.
A:	Oh.
A:	Well good.
A:	You have a computer at home?
B:	I do,
B:	yes.
A:	Oh, good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Not all of them being mine.
A:	Wow.
A:	Then you are busy
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that is very good.
B:	Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?
A:	Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading,
A:	and I stopped because it was so,
A:	it's
A:	the book is so detailed
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you have to,
A:	sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all.
A:	And, uh, it is so detailed,
A:	Hi.
A:	What do you think about gun control?
B:	Well, uh, sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess, uh, uh,
B:	I, I I lean more towards the control side than, than towards, you know, just the, the free, free army.
B:	Uh, on the other hand I, it's, it's sort of an issue of, of uh,
B:	I'm not, I'm not a great fan of, of government control in general
B:	and so it's, it's kind of a tough issue.
B:	What about yourself?
A:	Well, I guess that I would like to, to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or, uh, have a legitimate use for the, the, the weapon I suppose because also, living in this area, the, the problems in D C come home very quickly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm, I'm sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, so you would take a position where somebody without, without a, uh, uh, specific use,
B:	in other words, if they just wanted to have a, a gun to have in their home, uh, you wouldn't, you wouldn't like them to be able to do that?
B:	Is that,
A:	Well, I'm not so sure about that,
A:	but I think somehow, uh, safety courses
A:	or, I don't know whether this could be something that was done in school,
A:	but somehow people,
A:	I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were, whether they followed them or not.
A:	but still,
B:	I, I have, uh, I have the impression that, that the, the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not, are, are probably not from the people that are, are buying them through legitimate channels anyway.
B:	Uh, that may be wrong.
B:	Uh, you know, I mean, certainly there, there are cases of, of, you know, children who find their parents' gun or something and, and shoot a brother or sister or, you know, things like that that need to be definitely avoided
B:	and that's, that's certainly within the channels,
B:	right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, a lot of the, the crime, I think, that goes on, I, I don't know to what the degree the guns are, are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know,
A:	this morning in our paper, it, there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license,
A:	so he went over there and got a driver's license, the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for, you know, very high markups.
A:	Now, in a sense, that's a legal way of getting the guns,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but certainly the the purpose is not very legal.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	I, I mean, I think, uh, some
B:	or, I, I don't know if it's been actually been implemented,
B:	I think so, uh,
B:	or at least there's been talk about doing, uh, you know, like waiting periods and and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and, and, uh, you know, I, I think stuff like that is perfectly good.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I've, you know,
B:	I, I don't own a gun and, and don't really want one,
B:	and I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but on the other hand, you know, uh, like I say, I kind of, kind of against government control in general.
B:	Uh,
A:	Right.
A:	And I suppose uh, you know, total ban would lead to more illegal weapons.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I, you know,
B:	something about banning is that, you know, there, there are so many weapons out there that, that they're not going to disappear anytime soon.
B:	Uh, and they're already,
B:	I know there's a ready market for them, you know,
B:	in the
B:	the stolen, stolen guns can be sold.
B:	I mean, the first thing a, a, a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	because, uh, because they, they can be so easily sold
B:	and, you know, they're, they're,
B:	I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country,
B:	but, uh, it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden. Uh, even if you do do a total ban on them.
B:	Uh, it's a real tough problem.
A:	Right.
B:	I, I don't know,
B:	I don't know where I really come down on it.
B:	I mean, I, I grew up,
B:	my father was a hunter,
B:	right,
B:	and that's, and that's sort of almost a separate issue.
B:	I think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	But that's true.
A:	I mean, some people grew up with guns in the house.
A:	We never had any in the house
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, to me, the, you know, the first time I saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing.
A:	And I'm not sure that's good either.
B:	well we, you know, we, I grew up with them.
B:	I never really took to hunting.
B:	I mean, I did some of it,
B:	but, uh, you know, we didn't have any, we never had any handguns or anything like that.
B:	We had, you know, had shotguns for, for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, it was a whole different thing
B:	and, and gun safety was taken very seriously
B:	and it was, you know,
B:	I mean, before we go hunting, we, we took safety courses, uh, you know,
B:	and, and, and it,
B:	but, you know, that's, that seems to me to be just a whole another issue.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know, the, the thing,
B:	the, the,
B:	yeah,
B:	I'm not certain that people are, are, are terribly concerned about other people.
A:	Do you, uh, have a family budget,
A:	or, how do you work your budgeting?
B:	Well, for many, many years, uh, my wife and I did have a budget.
B:	Uh, we were both working at the time and so forth
B:	and, uh, that,
B:	we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and, and other big bills taken care of.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we have a, a budget,
B:	but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So it, it's, uh, it's helpful.
B:	I mean, yes,
B:	having a budget is very, very important
B:	and that did get us so that, you know, the house is paid for and, uh, other major things are taken care of
B:	and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before,
B:	so we don't have to have quite as strict, uh, a budget as we did.
A:	Oh, well, we don't have a real strict budget.
A:	Uh, we have a, a low budget to work on,
A:	but we, uh, you know,
A:	for like groceries, we say about this much per week
A:	and then we just spend about so much.
B:	Sure,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	We don't, I, I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we, you know, keep to or anything,
A:	but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within, you know, five dollars between here and there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	A certain amount.
B:	I think I've, I do that automatically myself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I unconsciously, uh, you know, stay in a, within a, with a certain amount because I, I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time.
A:	Oh.
B:	All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that.
A:	Wow,
A:	that's great.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have two freezers,
B:	and, course, we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
B:	and we freeze a lot of that,
B:	so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, you guys sound pretty self sufficient
B:	Well, we, we keep a little note pad on a, on a wall.
B:	if anything is absolutely out, make a note of it
B:	and then, uh, the next time I go to the store, why, I pick it up and fill it up.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it's, it's worked very well that way.
B:	That way we you know, if each of us finds something is missing, uh, we put it up.
B:	Uh, the other person might not know about it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That way we keep up to date
A:	Well, that's a good idea.
A:	Let's see,
A:	the other thing there the topic was talking about was, if, if, uh,
A:	all I can think of is if you don't keep a real, a real tight budget, how do you control expenses,
A:	but, uh, one,
A:	another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas.
A:	Well, not fly back,
A:	but somehow we get back there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive
A:	and,
B:	Well, actually, it's more interesting, too, if you've got the time.
A:	Huh?
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh, you know, we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, I think we unconsciously do the same thing.
B:	Excuse me, my throat's not as clear today as it should be.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's all right.
B:	Uh, we are, uh, going to be traveling to Europe with a choral.
B:	We sing with a so called Pennsylvania choral
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we make a two weeks tour of, of, uh, foreign countries
B:	and, of course, that costs money.
B:	So we, uh,
B:	each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that, that we gather together over a period a time enough money to, to make this trip.
B:	So that is another way of, uh, budgeting
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.
B:	We, uh, just live a normal life,
B:	but we don't throw any money away, particularly.
B:	We save it for this trip, which is, uh, always very, very nice.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, whenever
A:	I don't know if this is part of the topic,
A:	but whenever I find, you know, a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up
B:	I do the same thing.
B:	I have a whole pile of them saved that I have found by parking meters
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah,
A:	I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in.
A:	You know, just count it up at the end of the year, something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	But, yeah.
B:	Well, let's face it,
B:	the, when we're talking budget, it is important to, to have a budget
B:	and, uh, I, I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account
B:	and I have a money market account also.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I keep those levels up above a certain minimum,
B:	and I'm always trying to,
A:	Well, are you in the market for a new car?
B:	Uh, well, yeah,
B:	I am as a matter of fact.
B:	Well, actually I'm looking for another car,
B:	but, uh, uh, new,
B:	probably not.
A:	Oh.
A:	What sort of requirements to you have for your car?
B:	Uh, sports car.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, usually either black or red.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And electric windows, and power locks
A:	I see
B:	Now,
A:	Top of, top of the line.
B:	Well, not so much that as it is,
B:	I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.
A:	Oh.
B:	It is just a real pain,
B:	or, you know, if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And, uh, so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, uh, just really help a lot
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	What about you?
A:	Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that I know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work
B:	Sure.
A:	And then I want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage
A:	and I want an air bag
A:	and, uh, I guess,
B:	Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't.
A:	Have you?
B:	No.
A:	Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea
B:	Well, it, it sure seems to save lives
B:	and
A:	Right.
B:	uh, yeah.
B:	I, actually, I like the anti-lock brakes.
A:	Right,
A:	that's a good idea.
B:	And I have never had a chance to,
B:	I have been in cars that have had them,
B:	but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, uh, you know, on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or Japanese?
A:	Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands.
A:	I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American
A:	and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh,
A:	and I needed air-conditioning
A:	and, uh, can't remember what my, oh,
A:	I wanted uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice
A:	There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
B:	What was that?
A:	It, it turned out to be a, a Chrysler. Uh Lancer.
B:	Huh,
B:	stick shift,
B:	huh?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed?
A:	No,
A:	a five speed.
A:	And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up,
A:	and so it had been on the lot three months
A:	and they were really eager to sell it.
B:	Wow.
A:	So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
B:	Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift
B:	and, what, I'm, I'm curious.
B:	I, I know why I love a stick shift.
B:	Why why did you want one?
A:	Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one
A:	and I thought it would be more reliable.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.
A:	I found that out.
A:	I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement
A:	so,
B:	Huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	So,
B:	No,
B:	I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.
A:	Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore. At least in this area.
B:	Huh.
A:	Not that I was looking for sports cars,
A:	but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
B:	Huh.
A:	And so why do you like stick shift?
B:	Uh, I guess I, I grew up on it and it's fun.
B:	It's, it's an enjoyable part of driving.
B:	I do feel like I have, uh, more control over the car
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, it, it does, uh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	it, it's really more fun than anything
B:	else. As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun
A:	Right,
A:	and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, of course, I like gadgets and, and, uh, fun things, on the cars, which are all the things, course, the
A:	Are we tonight?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sure.
A:	Okay,
A:	well let me go ahead and press one
A:	Okay, Leslie,
A:	I'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies.
A:	What do you like to do in your spare time?
B:	Well, and when I have my spare time I do enjoy,
A:	Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days, huh.
B:	That's right.
B:	Uh, I do enjoy, uh, sewing,
B:	I hand, uh,
B:	I do some needlepoint.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And I, I've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law,
B:	but if I, uh, ever get enough spare time, he might see it one day.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And some other things I like to do are, is music and, uh, also reading.
A:	What kind of music?
B:	Well I enjoy singing.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well great.
A:	I enjoy music too
A:	and I, uh,
A:	one thing that I like to do, uh, is sit down and play the piano.
A:	I can't play that well,
B:	Um.
A:	I enjoy that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh,
A:	I really enjoy bike riding
A:	and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in.
B:	Yes.
A:	Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer
A:	so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
A:	and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.
A:	So we're riding bicycles
A:	and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And uh, so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to change.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.
A:	I really enjoyed skiing. Uh, and a lot of outdoor activities.
A:	Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now,
B:	That's right.
A:	but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day
A:	but,
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	I have not had the opportunity to go skiing
B:	but, uh, I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it
B:	but uh, never did get out and ski
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You didn't?
B:	No,
B:	I never did.
B:	Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
B:	and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places.
B:	I couldn't go by myself.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	That's true.
B:	And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.
B:	So
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	I guess that for me it was very helpful.
A:	My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	And so we, we went quite often
A:	and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.
A:	When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago
A:	and we would go skiing and enjoy that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have
A:	and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned
A:	and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.
B:	That's right.
A:	It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	Oh yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
B:	so she's real excited about doing that.
A:	Well, great.
B:	We will be busy with that again.
A:	What, again.
A:	So you have participated with that in the past?
B:	Pardon me?
A:	Have you participated in that in the past?
B:	Well, I did with my older daughter
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she was in it for a few years,
B:	but she has got so many interests herself that, we had to start eliminating
B:	and well the first one to go.
B:	She still likes her piano
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she is in band.
B:	So, she's got lots of hobbies or, uh, activities going on.
A:	It sounds like her life is full too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place.
B:	Very much.
B:	That's right
B:	That's right.
A:	All right.
A:	All right.
A:	Well, Leslie, it's been very nice talking to you.
A:	Is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight
B:	Uh.
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	I think we covered it pretty good.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Great.
B:	Thank you for calling.
A:	Well thank you
A:	and you have a nice evening.
B:	You too.
B:	Bye,
B:	bye.
A:	Bye now.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, are you a fisher person, are you?
A:	Yes,
A:	I love to fish.
B:	Great.
B:	What kind of fishing do you do?
A:	Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.
B:	In California?
A:	And, yes,
A:	and from the banks.
A:	I don't like to go out on boats.
B:	Oh.
B:	Well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?
A:	Well, it, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	But, I like it all except, uh, really I don't, I don't really care that much for the trout.
A:	I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout
B:	Well, I, I don't blame you.
B:	I grew up in Nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River
B:	and then, uh, we moved to, uh, South Dakota and, uh, did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing
B:	but, uh, I still, uh, I am sort of a catfish man at heart.
A:	See. Well, uh, like in, uh, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?
B:	Yep.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do.
A:	You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads
A:	and that's,
A:	they look just like baby catfish.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	I like to fish.
B:	The only problem is I just moved to Texas
B:	so it's been a little over a year now
B:	but, uh I, I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's driving me crazy
B:	but, uh, one of these days, I will go over to, uh, Lake Lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	sure.
A:	Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,
B:	Well
B:	Yeah.
B:	Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.
B:	Uh, and you're right.
B:	I mean I like to fish for trout
B:	and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters
B:	but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish
B:	or do you fillet them out,
B:	how do you, how do you,
A:	We, uh, skin them.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Just cut their heads off and skin them
A:	and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't put that corn meal on them.
B:	No.
A:	You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them
A:	so
B:	Well, that's how we do it too.
B:	Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out
B:	and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish
B:	and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
B:	and, uh,
B:	and it really tastes pretty good.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.
B:	There, uh,
A:	Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel
B:	but, uh so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines
A:	Um.
B:	so,
A:	Wouldn't that be something?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike
B:	and, uh, they really, uh,
B:	in, in,
B:	when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,
B:	but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So when you were,
A:	when you did go fishing where did you go?
A:	You moved there from where?
A:	Nebraska?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the lakes I suppose, huh?
B:	In, In Nebraska?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,
B:	so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
B:	but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for,
A:	Afternoon, Doug,
A:	it certainly is, uh, going to be a pleasure to chat with you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm, uh, certainly was surprised to, uh, to hear from you.
A:	Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	me too.
A:	How did you get on this list?
B:	Uh, through Nancy Dahlgren.
B:	She, um, she had somehow gotten the information from T I and was distributing it around.
A:	Well, okay.
A:	All right.
A:	Well, now, what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy?
A:	What ideas do you have on that, Doug?
B:	Um, see, I'm not sure that,
B:	I don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country,
B:	but I think that the opportunity is definitely there for, um, people to invade your privacy when they want to,
B:	I think it's, um,
A:	In what manner?
B:	Well, it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.
B:	It's completely trivial to, for instance, listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone, since they're just radio signals.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, um,
B:	and let's see,
B:	well, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?
A:	Well, the thing that I thought they were, uh, concerned about was, was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and in reality in many cases, they knew, or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations.
A:	And I thought was, uh, beginning to invade the privacy of people, because the things about where you live and, and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business,
A:	and they in return, come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge.
A:	To me that's an invasion of privacy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I agree with you there, for sure.
B:	Um, and I think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get.
B:	It's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history, for instance, if they just, um, twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, you know, possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change it if he wants to.
A:	You mean your history in regards to, uh the charge card company or something like that?
B:	Well, um.
B:	Well, yes,
B:	well, for instance, yes, um,
B:	and they'll probably goes into other things, like, you know, your records with the government or utility companies or anything.
A:	Do you consider these serious, uh, problems?
B:	Um, uh, not, not yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread enough,
B:	but I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, what should we do about it,
A:	or what could be done about it, do you think to correct it?
B:	Um I'm not really sure, because the, I mean society is going more and more electronic,
B:	and there are certainly benefits to its doing so,
B:	and it's hard to, hard to say whether the, um, risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not,
B:	and I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't.
B:	Why,
B:	do you see any out for us?
A:	Well, I would think that, uh, information held on records, uh, by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and, and not be allowed to be, uh, to, given out by those companies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, it should be made a, a, uh, national or a state law to protect people so that, uh, you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, uh, and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else, uh, you know, from the outside, so to speak then you would, you would feel more free to, uh, to go into detail with them
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I.
A:	but, but we have no control of that now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, uh, you, you're, when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you, you feel that it someday might be used against you.
A:	Uh, I basically, uh, listen to the news from the T V.
A:	That's probably the only time I get a chance to, uh, uh, take a look at it is the evening news
A:	and, and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise.
A:	But, uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through, uh, uh, you know, uh, through conversation or whatever
A:	but, uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening
A:	so that's about the,
B:	You don't get any newspapers?
A:	Newspapers?
A:	No,
A:	I'm not too much in reading newspapers.
A:	Uh, not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that
A:	but, uh, part of it is because I just don't feel like I need, the need to have them, uh, with watching the T V or whatever.
A:	We get our weekly news around the area
A:	and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state
A:	But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, uh, news coming in that kind of stuff.
B:	I'm kind of the opposite of you.
B:	I get all my news from newspapers.
A:	Oh, you do
B:	We have, we have two newspapers.
A:	You read it in the morning then?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Two newspapers in the morning.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh  I'm, uh, in, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot
A:	Sure.
B:	so, uh, I, I kind of look through to see, see what, uh, I'm quoted in.
A:	Oh, sure
B:	But, uh, how, how bad the quotes are every day.
A:	To see if they did it or if they, uh, criticize you or put something in there wrong.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	Or, uh, sometimes there's, uh, letter to the editor about me
B:	or there's a, even, uh, editorials  for and against what I'm doing
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure,
A:	exactly
B:	But, uh, but T V, uh, the T V, I, I don't really watch, even if I'm, even if I'm on it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	But just,
A:	Well, that's, that's kind of like you said then.
A:	We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
A:	and, uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock
A:	so, by that time, you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever.
A:	But, uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, other than that, no.
A:	It's,
B:	And that's,
B:	C N N had the, uh,
B:	everybody was watching C N N,
B:	that seemed to be the place to be  to find out what was going on on that.
A:	Exactly,
A:	exactly,
A:	exactly,
A:	sure.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well it brought kind of, uh, more of a vivid, uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things.
A:	But, uh, yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	You know you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on
A:	and, uh, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all
A:	so. But,
B:	Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, uh,
B:	a lot of times the, the news on, uh, the local T V is so brief, you really don't get the full picture of what, uh, what's going on.
A:	Exactly happens.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
A:	That's,
B:	And, uh, that's, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, uh, idea of what's happening.
B:	But,
A:	Oh sure,
A:	a clip, you know, a sentence or two
A:	and that's about it of what went on
A:	and, uh, they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time.
A:	Sure.
B:	Right.
B:	But  I like the weather report.
A:	Makes sense.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I
B:	I alway, always, I always turn that on
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	that's one part I watch because of, uh, I go surfing down here
B:	and I always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you're right on the coast line.
A:	You're not, uh, further up.
A:	You're,
B:	Yeah.
B:	No.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Sure.
A:	I suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Sure.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Weather channel's good
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's about the only time in the, in the summer, uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on,
A:	they'll kind of say, well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever.
A:	This is the, what is expected,
A:	but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, uh, so fast you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
B:	Yeah.
A:	so.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I can predict my, my week and where I'm going to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	So I can be at the, at the beach when the waves start coming in.
A:	to take off.
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's,
A:	sounds pretty good
A:	so. Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here
A:	or it's got to be fairly close to that
A:	Okay.
B:	So, what is your opinion on, on drug testing?
A:	Well I can see it in certain cases where it might be, uh, somebody's in a position that, uh, perhaps a lot of lives are involved, like, maybe, uh, pilots that, uh, you know, fly jets
A:	and, uh, maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people.
A:	I could certainly see it being done
A:	but, in general, uh, you know,
A:	whether companies want to do this
A:	and I know that companies do.
A:	Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested.
A:	I know a couple of corporations that are doing that.
A:	Uh, so, you know, they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab.
A:	But there's got to be like a limitation.
A:	Do we drug test everybody that comes in
A:	and or do we kind of say, well you can be drug tested
A:	and you look okay because you look this way.
A:	You're, you're very conservative
A:	and, and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs
A:	but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of, uh, the conservative or whatever could be drug tested.
A:	And,
A:	uh, you know, whether legal rights and, of that person,
A:	I don't know.
A:	There's certainly a lot of things to really consider, uh, when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless, of course, like I said, they have a large responsibility over a mass of people
A:	uh, that's about it.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	it, it, it's just not the
B:	you're talking about company's liability.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	If, if, uh, if the company is liable for something that, that, a employee does while under the influence of, of a drug, you know, then by all means they should have the right to, to, to, to  to minimize their liability.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
A:	And I think that's what companies are doing, uh, more and more because there are products that are out there.
B:	And there's also the case about just, uh, uh, health, health and welfare of the, uh, employees.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If a company has a healthy work force, their  insurance rates are low.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	And not only not only low, there's all sorts of a, of a benefits, uh, financial benefits associated  with having, you know, having people file fewer claims, being sick.
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
A:	The only thing is,
B:	There, there's the whole question that, that a, that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
B:	I don't think anybody  would argue with that.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Exactly.
A:	The only thing is, uh,
A:	the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive.
B:	Right.
A:	If they have had like, uh, medications in the past, let's say, once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil
A:	and the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked marijuana.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, and there's poppy seed type things.
A:	I think that everybody is aware of that
A:	but, uh, where's the line where you, where you say to somebody, I'm going to drug test you tomorrow
A:	so please do not take these medications
A:	or where's,
A:	you know how can  how you can do it?
B:	Well,
B:	the
B:	Right.
B:	The question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests, who tests positive.
A:	Exactly.
B:	that's where the real sticking point comes in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not,
B:	I don't think there's any problem with testing people.
A:	Sure.
B:	It's what do you do with the information?
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
A:	and the only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on.
A:	Let's say, uh, you've taken medication of some sort, even though they usually have you, at the time, list what medications you've taken.
A:	Uh, let's say you do come out positive
A:	and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there.
A:	Or you've had a cold
A:	and you've been on medication or whatever,
A:	you come out positive.
A:	Is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well, you know, this is kind of iffy, you know,
A:	are they really on drugs
A:	or, or they on drugs,
A:	you know what I'm saying.
A:	Where  there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person, uh, is on drugs
B:	Right.
A:	or make up, they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee,
A:	you know what I'm  saying?
B:	Right.
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	I think clearly, the person who is the line the line manager
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing.
B:	That should go to an entirely different, uh, agency within a corporation.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Uh,
A:	And it's a,
A:	they can that the,
A:	if it does come out positive the first time, they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take,
A:	you know what I mean?
A:	It, it's kind of like, uh,
A:	I think most people are aware, at least now, common knowledge is that
A:	Uh, I don't know.
A:	Your camping experience is probably,
A:	I don't know if they're similar to mine
A:	but, uh, since I've had children it has changed a little bit,
A:	but, uh, when my husband and I were, uh, camping, we'd take this domed tent that, uh, is easily collapsible and, uh, go camping and, uh, just kind of roughed it.
A:	As long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that, then it was fine.
A:	But, uh, we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little, uh, escapade for the day and, uh, kind of, uh, do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to.
A:	But, uh, that's kind of changed now.
A:	When you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning
A:	and you don't want them up that early.
B:	Would you then go hiking.
B:	I mean would the camping be part of a long hike?
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	We did a lot of different things.
A:	We'd stop when we wanted to, that kind of stuff.
A:	So, we kind of did a little bit of hiking, sure, and a little bit of, uh, sightseeing, uh, different areas. Uh, sitting back at different areas and spending hours,
A:	we never had really a time limit,
A:	we just kind of did what we wanted to do for that day.
B:	Um.
A:	Very comfortable,
A:	so.
B:	Were you up in, in Wisconsin
B:	or would you go into
B:	where would you camp ?
A:	Well, there's, uh, places in Wisconsin.
A:	There's the Apostle Islands, uh which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then there's also, uh, what we found, uh, in the state of, uh, South Dakota, the Black Hills.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's beautiful.
A:	And we just have this, uh, really good time there.
A:	One thing is they don't have mosquitoes
A:	and, uh, sorry to say,  and, uh, in Wisconsin we do,
A:	so, that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your, uh, you know,
A:	if, if you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs
A:	and, uh
B:	Right
A:	We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes.
A:	They just don't have them
A:	and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, most of my camping,
B:	I haven't done much since I was a kid
B:	but, uh, we'd, basically, take the tent up in the Sierras and, uh, usually just camp near some stream  or some lake.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	And, uh, just,
B:	it wasn't even a, a full tent.
B:	It would be more a tarp, uh strung up between trees
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	and, uh, we just thought it was absolute heaven.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, there was certainly nothing like a, a bathroom, a shower or anything, near by
B:	It was dig your own hole
B:	and, uh  and I I'm not sure I'd do that  that anymore,
A:	That was really called roughing it,
A:	yeah.
A:	I,
A:	Anymore.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see
B:	but it's, it, uh, uh,
B:	actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer, uh, for four days.
B:	Also  going fishing, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have a idea it's going to be a, a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than  before.
A:	Than you,
A:	sure.
A:	Than it, when you were younger,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	it,
A:	with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday.
A:	With kids they don't care, you know, uh, a about a lot of things.
A:	But as adults, uh, it's like if I don't take a shower every day, I feel like, you know, ooh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I just don't feel right
A:	so. There's lots of places if you're going to go camping.
A:	K O A are wonderful.
A:	It's kind of it's kind of the, uh, yuppie type of camping because they have showers,
A:	they have things for kids to do.
A:	They have swimming pools, things like that.
A:	If you  can find, uh, some really nice, clean, uh, campgrounds versus, uh, if you go to state parks, uh,
B:	Oh, my.
A:	we have found state parks, not that they're lacking
A:	but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner.
A:	You've got the showers available.
A:	It's not, you know, in the same category.
A:	State parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled
A:	but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different.
A:	But, so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night.
A:	That's the only time you really use your campground.
A:	If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did,
B:	So interesting political trends or events, huh?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I guess the, uh, most interesting one that's, uh, going on right now, from my perspective, is this, uh, phenomena of, uh, uh, Ross Perot.
B:	Uh, caught his interview last night with David Frost
B:	and it was  the, the first time I had, you know, heard, uh, his views expressed by himself.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But the whole phenomena of him coming out of, uh, literally nowhere and no party. Uh, at least, no apparent party support on either side is  pretty interesting.
A:	Huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have not even heard, believe it or not, of that person.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not kidding.
A:	When you, when you said it, it was kind of like a surprise.
B:	Like out of nowhere?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I,
A:	as far as
A:	like now, the new house bill that went to Minnesota, uh, being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota, I'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that, and that being passed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, as far as politics in the grander, uh, part of it as if you want to look at, uh, election type things, I'm not quite sure even if I'm going to vote.
A:	Uh it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that, to make the decision on who would be the best to run.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it seems that the decision, so far, has been filtered by, uh, you know, party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval, party support and therefore get presented to the public, the, the  candidates are already beyond what, uh, most public, uh, feels is acceptable behavior.
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, the,
B:	one of the common criticisms of Clinton is, uh, gee, he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House.
A:	Sure.
B:	And, and, up and to the point of, uh, Perot being a serious candidate, it seems like that, that was a requirement of being a, a contender within the party is to have done all those things.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	I mean, here's, here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward, you know, getting the party nomination and, and preparing himself for the presidency
B:	and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are, you know, pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena.
A:	He might be a, a one of those,
A:	sure.
A:	Uh, it, it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer, uh,
A:	when you think of some of the best presidents we've had, in the past, have been people that have struggled to get to the top.
A:	I mean, they were not rich in in any means
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it has been kind of, in the past, uh, I don't know, maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics, they've had to have money.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so it makes the common person, uh,
A:	not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent
A:	and I don't know if we'll ever see that you know. Where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and, uh, has, uh, you know,
A:	you think of Abraham Lincoln and, you know, just the background of Abraham Lincoln. You know, teaching himself to read.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He didn't go to college.
A:	He didn't, you know, do all the other things that, uh, you know, you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved in and have money.
A:	He didn't come  from money.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and now it's,
B:	And, and yet even he was a, a consummate politician in the sense that, uh, not only did he, uh, fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the first and the first and only election he won was, uh, the presidency
A:	Yeah
B:	He, he had lost every other office that he had, you know,
B:	he was appointed a couple of times to, like, uh, uh, state legislator.
A:	So you really know a lot of his background.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Then, then when he finally, you know, did win an election, uh, you know, it was the presidency.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It was the big one.
A:	It's the one that everybody wants.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Whether or not I, you know,
A:	you look at all these candidates that want to become president.
A:	I really have to ask them why, you know.
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh, it's the toughest job in the world to do.
A:	And not only that, you don't have that much freedom to make choices.
A:	I mean you  have to go through so many different,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you have to go the House, the Congress, and all of the other things  to get a bill passed.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And sure you can veto veto it at the last minute
A:	but then it's not like you have all that power
A:	and I think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, hello, um,
A:	what is your favorite, um, food for a dinner party?
B:	Um, I don't know,
B:	I, I think I make things, you know,
B:	I do things kind of simple because I, you know, I just have close friends over.
B:	I make like lasagna
B:	and, uh, oh, we like to have barbecues outside so, you know, when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather,
B:	so, we do a lot of, um, things like that.
B:	Um, I'm not really into gourmet cooking,
B:	so, I don't know how to do that,
B:	so, I don't have gourmet foods
A:	Do you do Tex-Mex?
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	you know, like fajitas and stuff like that,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, fajitas,
A:	how do you make fajitas?
B:	Um, it's kind of like made out of skirt steak
B:	and you marinate it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You can buy marinating mixes here
B:	I don't know, get it up there.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, you can, you know, marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like
B:	and then you, uh, you quick fry it real fast with, in hot, hot grease. You know, not a not, not deep frying it
B:	but you can either barbecue it which is really good, with, uh, green beans, not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions.
B:	And, uh, then you put it on a flour, like, you know,
B:	you make your meat real, uh, thin, you know, bite-size pieces.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then you put it on flour tortillas with, you know, guacamole and, uh, sour cream and, you know, all kinds of, you know,
B:	it's like a Tex-Mex type thing.
A:	Oh, it sounds good.
B:	It's really good.
B:	You can do it with chicken too.
B:	Chicken fajitas and stuff.
A:	Okay.
B:	So.
A:	Well, that's nice.
B:	So, what kind of cooking do you do up there?
A:	Oh, well, basically, um, because I lived in the Middle East for a while I tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I have, have people over.
A:	And so, um, some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with, um, sesame.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, cold um,
A:	what's it called,
A:	I forgot, what it's called,
A:	anyway and, and my,
B:	You cook them so often you kind of forget their names.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	It's called ,
A:	now I remember it.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, um, dipping Arabic bread, the thin piece of bread in that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or another dip is made with, very similar but with, um, eggplant which has been actually
A:	it ends up with a barbecued taste.
A:	I,
A:	although we usually bake it in the oven
A:	or if we have, uh,
A:	those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black, on the outside but mushy on the inside.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh, that's unusual I'd never heard of anything like that, you know.
B:	Here in Texas it's all, you know, Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue
B:	and,
A:	But barbecue is it like steaks
A:	or is it, uh, turkey?
B:	Yeah,
B:	you barbecue
B:	Pardon me?
A:	Would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken
A:	or,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill
B:	but my, I cook my turkeys inside, you know,
B:	it
B:	you can buy smoked turkeys.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And or, uh, but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	the simple things like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, barbecue beans and baked beans
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm sure that the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce.
A:	I wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	this is more like hickories, hickory type, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	depending on the
B:	it's like a smokey flavor, if you've ever, you know, had stuff like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's totally different.
B:	Sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle Eastern cooking,
B:	so.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's been fun talking to you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's been fun,
B:	it's been nice,
B:	it's, uh, you know, new to learn some, what different people eat,
A:	Right.
B:	I come from Wyoming
B:	and it's basically the same, same type of thing except for you do eat more the Tex-Mex down here,
B:	so.
A:	Uh, in Wyoming it would be less spicy?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	you, you know,
B:	down there it's just like meat and potatoes, you know.
A:	Vegetables once in a while.
B:	Yeah,
B:	right
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	Well, it's been interesting to talk to you.
A:	Okay,
A:	very good.
B:	Thank you for calling.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right,
B:	Yes.
B:	I, I,
A:	Why do you think the apathy exists?
A:	I blame it to apathy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	um, I, I suspect the apathy is due to something like people just feeling that, that their vote doesn't count anyway.
B:	I mean, why, why bother voting if, um, if your vote won't make a difference.
B:	So for instance, in, um, the last presidential election, I'm sure a lot of people thought, Oh, Bush is going to win either way,
B:	why bother voting.
A:	Why should I go out of my way when it doesn't matter.
B:	That's right.
B:	I think that's,
B:	and, and the other side of the coin is, um, people saying, well, if I really like the underdog candidate, I still think they're not going to win,
B:	so are only the same two caucuses, certainly not going to win, why bother voting for him.
B:	So. I I think that's a big, uh, a big, a big reason for it.
B:	How
A:	Oh, I think so, too.
A:	And I think the other thing is the news media puts such a blitz on it that they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting, you know.
B:	Um, that's true.
B:	Actually I never thought about that,
B:	that, that's a good
A:	And I, I think the, you hear the news, you know, you start out in the morning, and all day you hear the news,
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you think on the local elections though?
B:	I think on the local elections it's actually, um,
B:	I think, um, I think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like, well, you know, the country's real important,
B:	and, you know, if I, if we help elect a president who's going to save us, then, then the whole country will be saved.
B:	But they figure local elections don't mean that much, I suspect.
B:	So people don't really worry about their local mayor or something, figuring that, you know, and I think wrongly, figuring that, that, well, what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now, and you know, and stuff like that.
B:	So people think that, that, that they don't have, um, that, that it doesn't matter as much, whereas I think it's probably just the opposite is true.
B:	I think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level.
A:	Oh, I think so, too.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	Uh, I think another thing,
A:	and uh, I'm making a judgment here that may or may,
A:	I think it is totally wrong,
A:	well.
B:	Uh.
A:	I think that the people that are, have, um, a lower income, which you automatically equate with lower education tend not to be registered.
B:	Right.
B:	Um.
A:	And they don't register,
A:	and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time,
A:	or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today, they say, Well, I would
B:	Right,
B:	but,
A:	and I believe in this,
A:	but.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's possible.
B:	I still think that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference, though, as well.
B:	I think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote, are, are, are a lot of the people who think that well, look at me, I'm just a little nobody.
B:	My vote's not going to count anyway.
B:	You know, and I think that's probably a portion of the population that massively under
B:	I, I, I would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented.
A:	I had an interesting comment one time, a thought that would never have crossed my mind.
A:	I had someone tell me that, I will never register to vote because I don't want to serve on a jury
B:	Um?
B:	What do they have to do with one another?
A:	I just, I, they, I just wandered off from that one.
A:	I was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection.
B:	Oh, so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever.
A:	So they
A:	if they don't vote, they don't have to be on a jury.
B:	Oh, I didn't realize that actually.
B:	That,
A:	There is convoluted logic for you.
B:	Yeah,
B:	there is.
B:	There are much easier ways to get out of jury duty.
A:	Yes.
B:	Just go in and say, Oh, I want to be a juror,
B:	I can spot a guilty person a mile away.
A:	Oh, I just,
A:	right,
A:	right.
A:	There are so many other ways.
A:	But that one, it just defeated me.
A:	I didn't have any answer for that one.
A:	That one was just beyond my imagination.
B:	Well, that, that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around, sort of, you know, doesn't, doesn't, sort of, likes rights probably, but doesn't like responsibilities.
A:	That's a good point,
A:	you're probably right.
B:	I mean, that's what it boils down to, is people like to, people say, Oh, I don't want to be on jury, you know,
B:	I don't want to serve on jury duty,
B:	I don't want to vote,
B:	I don't want to do this and that.
B:	Well, then they could, you know, put them in the reverse situation, in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty
B:	and they don't have the right to vote
A:	Which,
B:	I suspect their opinions would change very quickly.
A:	And that was what I was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election,
A:	and they had, what, like a ninety-eight percent turnout.
B:	Yes.
A:	A massive turnout.
A:	At last, someone wants us to vote.
A:	They were standing in lines to vote.
B:	Yes,
B:	they were, they were doing that.
B:	Unfortunately, what, what, they, they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out.
A:	And their vote didn't count
B:	That's right.
B:	But, but it's the thought, they all got out
B:	But you wonder, if, you know, if, if now the next election they have, if only half of them are going to show up.
B:	Or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia.
A:	Or any one shows up.
B:	Right.
B:	That's, that's true.
A:	Total indifference, you know,
A:	what difference does it make.
A:	Back gone the full circle.
B:	Right.
B:	Now if things go the way that, that, that they are there, I think that they'll keep voting,
B:	but I think they'll wind up like us at some point, where people sort of, only half of them will end up voting, and sort of caring enough to really make a statement,
B:	so. You know, I think, I think that, that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the, are the ones who, who are really out to make a statement, because, you know, when, when, when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something, and even if he doesn't win, a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does, I think, make a statement to everyone else.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think
B:	and I think that's real important.
A:	Oh and I think women turn out to vote for women, too.
B:	That's probably true.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I
A:	well, I know it's true.
A:	You see a lot of that. You know, rally behind the female.
A:	She may lose,
A:	but by golly we're going to make a statement here you know.
B:	Um.
B:	That's good,
B:	that's actually really good.
B:	Well,
B:	actually the female who I would most rally behind right now, right, I don't know much about her politics, by the way, the way she makes speeches is a local person for you, is Ann Richards.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	I don't know her politics.
B:	I just know that, uh, I saw her speak in the eighty-four Democratic convention.
B:	And right then and there, if they said to me vote for someone for president, I would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards.
A:	Was, was that the time,
A:	no
A:	that was eighty-four,
A:	that's too soon.
A:	She said something about, uh, Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,
A:	and she did it backwards in high heels.
B:	That's very good.
A:	She said that,
A:	I didn't.
A:	Said, you know,
A:	don't tell me what women can do.
B:	That's, that's, that's, that's very good.
B:	That's,
B:	I, I like that.
B:	So I would, uh, I would vote for her,
B:	and I suspect she could get a large voter turnout.
A:	I think I did vote for her, as a matter of fact.
A:	I'm pretty sure I did.
B:	Say, I, I, I would think that, um, that, that people like that,
B:	I think inflammatory politicians are, um,
B:	or, or emotional politicians, certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out, I think.
B:	I would hope.
A:	Well, and some of the issues are so emotional.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, some of the really, the really emotional ones.
A:	Have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning?
B:	No,
B:	I've heard of it,
B:	but not necessarily the,
B:	I've heard it's very controversial though.
A:	I,
A:	everyone has made so many statements.
A:	I don't live in Dallas county.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I've heard so many statements that I've lost track.
B:	Um.
A:	I honestly at this point,
A:	it's, it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone.
A:	You really,
A:	even the news. You cannot follow what the the actual facts are at this point.
A:	I don't, I don't really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wonder about them at some point.
B:	Um, uh-huh.
B:	Well, they were elected as well,
B:	so. So. So they're going to be,
A:	That's correct.
A:	And that's, and that's another interesting question.
A:	Should judges be elected or appointed.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true.
A:	Are they politicians,
B:	and you don't want them to have, you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge.
A:	Sure.
B:	But on the other hand,
A:	Or you want to take the other side of it, you can argue,
A:	that's one of those you can pick either side
B:	Right.
A:	and we could spend a lot of time on it because it's, it's difficult.
B:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's situational, really.
B:	So, how do you think we can get people to vote?
A:	Uh, uh,
B:	I've had one idea that I think is, is, is completely undoable,
B:	but, but I think,
B:	but I suspect it would work.
B:	And the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate, who you never expect to win, to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements, so that a large population of, of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else.
A:	Oh.
B:	So given a choice between, you know,
B:	so that,
B:	so if you have,
B:	so if, if,
B:	imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes, you know, anti, you know, sort of, um, anti women statements, anti semitic statements, anti black statements, et cetera, et cetera,
B:	well then I suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just, just to spite that person.
B:	But I don't think that, that would actually ever work.
A:	Um.
A:	Well, this is true,
A:	this is true.
A:	I was worrying along the lines of you get every time someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box a dollar bill comes out the bottom.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's an interesting notion.
A:	That might work in some places.
B:	That, that, that, that would be interesting,
B:	yes,
B:	I think that would work in some places,
B:	yeah ...
A:	Okay.
A:	So, uh, then, do you keep kids?
A:	Is this two year old yours
A:	or do you keep children for other people?
B:	No.
B:	I have two children.
B:	I have a two year old and a three and a half year old.
A:	Oh, that's exactly what I have.
B:	Really?
A:	Yes.
B:	That's wild.
A:	I know.
A:	I,
A:	my, my little girl was three and a half in March
A:	and my son was two in January.
B:	Oh, boy.
B:	Well, mine was two in March
B:	and the three and a half year old will be four in, in July.
A:	That's pretty close.
B:	So that is pretty close
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I'm home with the kids all day
B:	and I have really, uh, tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us.
A:	Yes,
A:	it is.
B:	But,
A:	Have you been able to do that all along
A:	or,
B:	Pretty much,
B:	pretty much.
B:	Uh, I work part-time
B:	but, uh, my husband's able, you know, mostly to take care of them when I'm working.
B:	So.  But, uh, we adopted these two little guys
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, how neat.
B:	and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, you know, they have had a couple foster homes already.
A:	How old were they when you adopted?
B:	The baby was eleven weeks old
B:	and his brother was  twenty, twenty-two months.
A:	So he probably doesn't remember.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	definitely needed.
A:	Well, that's, that's pretty interesting.
A:	Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That was always my dream, you know.
A:	I wasn't necessarily a career person
B:	Yeah.
A:	but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And my husband was in the type of business that, you know,
A:	it's insurance
A:	so you have to build a clientele
A:	and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	And so I haven't been able to quit yet.
A:	So I've had to deal a lot with child care
A:	and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I started out, uh,
A:	my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born  until she went to work last year in August
B:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	and it worked out pretty good.
A:	You know, we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else.
A:	You know, the friendship is more important.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And, uh, it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them, you know.
A:	She loved them like they were hers
A:	and I I knew, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I had good peace of mind.
A:	I knew that they were taken care of
A:	and,
B:	That's the hardest thing I think, you know  to, to deal with is that people love your, kids.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I put, uh, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, you know  that kind of thing
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out
B:	and the, the teacher had eleven kids.
B:	It was excellent, supposedly.
B:	The reputation was fantastic for this place.
B:	Was supposed to be an excellent school
B:	and I had several friends who had, had recommended it, too.
B:	But it really gets down to the particular teacher.
A:	Huh.
B:	And she was a new teacher at the school
B:	and she had eleven, you know, three year olds in a room
B:	and I just think it was way too much.
B:	The were almost all boys.
A:	But she had no help?
B:	Pardon?
A:	She had no help?
A:	She was alone with them.
B:	I didn't think much.
B:	I don't think much.
A:	Oh, that is hard.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And she was just my, uh,
B:	three year old is real active.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And she just kept saying how wild he was.
B:	Well, you know, there was kind of a connotation there of him being, you know, it being a problem.
B:	Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said.
B:	Well, you know, at three years old  I don't find that to be a behavioral problem  You know
A:	Jeez.
A:	I don't either
A:	So.
B:	I mean, it's kind of like she was, there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's really hard to
B:	you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, you know.
A:	You have to let them have some wild time  if that's considered wild
B:	Yeah, you know.
B:	So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was expensive.
B:	But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.
B:	But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, you know, you really can't know everything about what's going to happen.
B:	I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, you know, because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms.
A:	Right.
B:	And I  felt like that was a big factor for me.
A:	Right.
B:	That they would would be safe you know, from any kind of abuse or that  kind of thing.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, when, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me
A:	and we'd work it out.
B:	Yeah.
A:	After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, you know, they needed it financially.
A:	She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy
A:	and I though,
A:	well, you know, we'll try her.
A:	But she came to our house
A:	and that just did not work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I mean, she loved the kids
A:	and she was good with them.
A:	But, uh, you know, they were filthy when I'd get home.
A:	Now I understand kids go out and play
A:	and they get dirty
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I mean filthy.
A:	I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair
A:	and the
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	and I was, like, gosh.
A:	And then, you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, you know,
A:	the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs
A:	and the,
B:	You had to come home and clean before you could  even do anything probably.
A:	and clean,
A:	and I was like,
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then, in the end, uh, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me
A:	so I was, I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth.
A:	She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.
B:	Oh gosh.
A:	Well, you know, I work eight to five thirty
A:	so what am I supposed to do
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I, well, I had been sick
A:	and I,
A:	it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick.
A:	So I stayed home with them
A:	and we went to some of the Kindercares.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I was, I took the kids there once just to try it.
B:	They had a free day at Kindercare.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's what they said.
A:	There were two pretty near our house
A:	and they said, well, bring them in this week for a free day
A:	so I lined up someone Tuesday.
A:	They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby-sitter took them to, you know, which was fine.
A:	They liked it.
A:	They had been going to it for years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I stayed with them Monday.
A:	Tuesday they went to that.
A:	Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare.
A:	Thursday I took them to another Kindercare
A:	and then Friday my husband and I split.
A:	But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares.
B:	I didn't either.
B:	I had  one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him.
A:	They,
A:	They didn't give him.
B:	And the other one was that the, the younger one got bit really badly by another child
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that's horrible.
A:	And doing something with him.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have you know. I didn't, I, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	we're, we're a Christian family
A:	and, you know, they, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private you know. They can't pray,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they can't talk about God.
A:	They can't do anything like that
A:	and I don't want them indoctrinated  you know,
B:	So you feel like your values aren't getting,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and   things like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	God loves you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, basic things like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	basic.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, I talked to another lady at church.
A:	It was like Thursday of that week
A:	and she said oh, I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter
A:	and I've know this girl,
A:	I went to college with her
A:	so I really, I, you, I, I value her opinion.
A:	And she told me about a private one.
A:	It, it was associated with one of the churches here.
A:	It's not the church I go to
A:	but it's, you know, it, it was Lubbock View Christian Church
A:	and it's a private academy.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I went over there
A:	and I talked to the lady.
A:	Well, they have like a three year waiting list.
A:	But she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio
A:	and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And she said I should know something by tomorrow, which was Friday,
A:	and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot.
B:	Wow.
A:	And so Friday afternoon at five thirty, she called me
A:	and she said she's going.
A:	You can bring your kids Monday
B:	Oh, what luck.
A:	I know.
A:	I was just like, God set this, up for me.
B:	Really
A:	He knew I needed this
A:	and, uh, so since October then, they have been going there
A:	and
A:	I love it.
A:	I have been at  such peace with myself.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles
A:	and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be.
B:	Yeah
B:	Oh, really?
B:	Wow.
A:	Did you hear my printer in the background.
A:	I'm sorry.
A:	I hope you can understand what I
B:	That's okay
B:	I got the dryer going in the background
A:	Yeah.
B:	so
A:	I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, they don't have to charge as much.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And the hours are wonderful
A:	and I just, I think it's the best thing.
A:	I told Russ that we should have done this a long time ago you know
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's great.
A:	So I guess as long as I have to work, I feel good that they're there.
A:	they're getting the love, the care.
A:	They have a little curriculum.
A:	They teach them, you know, the alphabet, the numbers, the things which, you know, if they learn, they learn.
A:	If they don't, they don't.
A:	I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it's kind of neat when they  come home with it, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They think it's fun.
B:	It's not a big, you know trauma to them to learn something.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, and the teachers.
A:	Well, Taylor got bit several times
A:	and Taylor bit several times
A:	and the teachers dealt with that.
A:	We're like, hey they're two
A:	and we keep them apart
A:	and we scold them
A:	and we correct them
A:	and, you know, they mark it all down
A:	and they let you know
A:	and, and, you know, they get over it real quick
A:	and he doesn't do it anymore
A:	and they work at the potty
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just, just
A:	so mu,
A:	I don't know.
A:	I just feel like a big burden was lifted
B:	Really.
B:	Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't  do anything with them here.
A:	It is.
B:	I can't even go grocery shopping right now  with the two of them because the baby is so into everything
B:	and the older brother is you know, running around all over the place
B:	so  it is, it's hard.
A:	and that's hard.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Well, and it, it, you know,
A:	but I
A:	I, I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your  peace of mind also.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I need to.
B:	Even for just a couple days a, mornings a week or something to have something like that,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I, I think I'm going to look for that.
B:	Remind me of that now that you mention it
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that's not that big a deal, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	For a couple times
A:	And that's usually like, you know,
A:	I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out,
A:	it was like from nine to three
A:	so that was a pretty good pretty good time, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	My baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up.
B:	Yeah
A:	So, that worked out real good.
B:	That's sounds good.
A:	Well, I'm tickled to death.
A:	I hope you find something
A:	and  it was good talking to you.
B:	Well, thanks.
B:	Did we cover everything we need to?
A:	Well, I guess.
B:	Okay.
A:	It said child care criteria
B:	Okay.
A:	and I think we both listed an experience
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
B:	Well, great.
B:	Well, thanks a lot.
B:	You have a good day.
A:	And you too.
B:	Bye-bye
A:	Bye
A:	Okay.
A:	I was thinking about camping and different people's ideas about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We've even seen people with these campers
A:	and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their T V when they're going.
B:	Right or their  satellite dish
A:	That's not,
A:	Yeah
A:	A satellite dish?
B:	On top of the recreational vehicles.
A:	Oh, golly!
A:	That's not the kind we do.
A:	Do you go camping?
B:	Yeah.
B:	We have a little bit
B:	and we've just gotten one of those little tents that we throw out on the ground
B:	and that's what we camp in.
B:	So we kind of rough it.
A:	Well, so do we.
A:	In fact, when we first got married, we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies
A:	so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks.
B:	Oh no.
A:	I mean, I know it's dangerous,
A:	I wouldn't do it now
A:	but we did
A:	And one time we went to Yellowstone
A:	and we were doing the same thing.
A:	We couldn't find a place to camp
A:	and so we were on top of a picnic table with our, our sleeping bags I guess.
A:	And this ranger comes up with this light, shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there. We had our food  you know. and told us to get inside our car.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Gosh. Bear bait
A:	Bear bait.
B:	That would make me nervous
A:	Yeah.
B:	Have you done any camping around here?
A:	Yeah.
A:	We've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we go up there fairly often
A:	Sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds fun.
A:	And we've done things like when, when it's kind of cold.
A:	We take extension cords
A:	and we've all got heaters in our tents.
A:	And in the Summer
A:	Same thing, we get our extension cords running from all these tents
A:	but we've got the fans going.
B:	Right
A:	So we're not roughing it too much.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we have taken T V out there for the kids
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they've got their electrical hookups.
A:	So it's not so bad.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Do you go on long?
B:	Like a week at a time or just weekends?
A:	I think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they even, they had a library at one time out there.
B:	Oh.
A:	So that's really not roughing it so much
A:	but  we have gone on trips where we bathed in streams.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's kind of different.
B:	Yeah
B:	I like the campgrounds that have a nice shower
A:	And a pool to go to.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That would be nice.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We've, uh, we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas. In the Fall
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there was nobody else, hardly, around
B:	and it was just really nice, that time of year.
B:	We had taken our electric, blanket too, just in case it was unbearable
B:	but we didn't need it
B:	Yeah .
A:	Well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon  with one of his friends
B:	Oh really?
A:	he just decided to take the kids out there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean it's not very many miles from our house at all.
A:	But they had the time of their lives, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Had the boat just pulled up right by the tents.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It wasn't bad.
B:	That sounds nice.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And we've taken, our tents though, loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way.
A:	And it ended up, when it came time for us to pull in for the night, we'd take a vote.
A:	And most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Instead of getting out all that stuff, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a lot of work to set up just for one night.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Then you have to get up the next day and move it on.
B:	Right
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	But we're set now.
A:	We've got cook stoves
A:	and we've got our bug light
A:	and everybody's got their sleeping bags,
A:	we got air mattresses.
A:	We decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Those are nice,
B:	we have one of those, too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Those double ones?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pretty good.
A:	We're on our third one I think.
A:	Somehow,
B:	Yeah.
B:	How do you blow yours up?
A:	We've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter.
B:	Oh.
B:	we were looking at those in a magazine.
B:	Last time we went, we took our vacuum cleaner with us
A:	I didn't know you could do that.
B:	And, yeah, you can, if you can reverse the, nozzle on your vacuum cleaner
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it blows air out instead of sucking it in
B:	and you can fill them up that way
B:	but something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient.
A:	No joke
A:	I hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner.
B:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have a, my husband and I, we have a pickup truck
B:	so there's plenty of room to hold things.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now we've used a hair dryer before.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I put it on hot and also melted it.
B:	Oh no
A:	I found that you don't do that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I didn't realize it would melt so easily.
B:	Oh.
A:	I don't know.
B:	We take, we take our dog camping.
B:	She likes to go out and stay in the woods.
A:	Yeah.
B:	She sleeps, she sleeps in the tent with us.
B:	It's fun
A:	I don't like it when there's mosquitos so bad.
B:	Oh, me either.
A:	And then one night we were camping
A:	and it came, just a torrential downpour.
A:	We had the steaks on the grill.
A:	These people were with us.
A:	And it, , I mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent.
A:	It was just that bad, you know
B:	Oh no.
A:	And we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I got a condo with a jacuzzi
A:	and it was wonderful.
B:	Oh boy
A:	Yeah.
B:	That was lucky.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was.
B:	We've been lucky.
B:	We've never really been rained on the few times we've gone.
A:	It's horrible.
B:	Oh I bet it,
B:	when we were younger, when I was a kid, we camped in Virginia
B:	and we had one of those little pop up tents, which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground.
B:	But it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a the year we were really into camping.
A:	You mean that you put on a truck or what?
B:	No.
B:	It's a little trailer you pull behind your car
B:	and, uh,  you know, you, the lid pops off,
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	the little tent comes up the top
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it had two double beds in it.
A:	with How many weeks have you been doing these calls?
B:	Oh, since the beginning.
B:	I guess it's been two or three weeks.
A:	I think this must be into my third week too.
A:	So do you work for T I?
B:	Uh, well, I work as a temporary in the Speech Lab.
A:	In a Speech Lab?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Where they're doing this program. The Voice Recognition Program.
A:	And what exactly are they going to do?
B:	Oh, they turn them over to somebody
B:	and they're going to, I guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff.
A:	So any voice, no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect  or anything.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um. I wonder if these are going to be speaking The computers,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I type up the tapes of what people talked about.
A:	Oh, that's kind of neat.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's sort of interesting.
A:	Do you put all the uh-huhs in here on everything, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Everything like that.
B:	All the little stutters and everything.
A:	What do you write for stutter?
A:	That, uh,
B:	Like if they say I, I, we just type it in like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I guess that's it for camping, uh
A:	I guess so unless you want to talk about stakes.
A:	What size stakes to put in
A:	You need metal instead of plastic.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We got one of those kind that have got the,
A:	oh what is it?
A:	They're plastic
A:	and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles
A:	and you just put them together.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	That's what we have, too.
A:	And it's a dome tent.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what ours is.
A:	That's good isn't it
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	they pop up pretty fast.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Have you ever camped on sand?
A:	Um, no.
B:	That can be a mess.
B:	We camped at the beach one time
B:	and that was sort of miserable.
B:	You just
B:	everywhere you went there was sand.
B:	You couldn't,
B:	even when you're eating,
B:	it, it was in your bed
A:	I've done it in a shelter.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was in Padre Island and in a  truck off Corpus, not, but not in a tent.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh well, that's about all .
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay .
B:	Well, it's good talking to you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Get us going.
B:	Okay.
A:	Are, are you at T I Austin
A:	or,
B:	Well, I left T I in January
B:	but I signed up for this before I did.
A:	Oh, that's great.
A:	No,
A:	uh, uh, my daughter has talked to, my daughter up here with us,
A:	I have another one,
A:	and she's talked to students, uh,
A:	so I guess they have, uh, sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things.
A:	So they're,
A:	if you're a computer user,
A:	so my daughter has talked to two students, uh, that were non, T I
B:	Oh, I think that's a, that's a good idea.
A:	So I guess,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	All right.
A:	we're on finances,
A:	have you, have you retired
A:	or, uh,
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no,
B:	no,
B:	no
A:	Oh.
B:	Actually I left T I, um, had basically set my sights to leave T I when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety-one, because I, I definitely need to make a little more money,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, uh, I haven't really accomplished that yet,
B:	but I'm trying.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it's, uh, that's,
A:	the finances,
A:	I guess we're on the subject of finances,
A:	it is tough.
A:	Uh, I've been with T I,
A:	I'm just going to be fifteen years this year
A:	and, and that's a tough thing, uh, the salary thing.
A:	T I doesn't quite always do it right.
A:	Well, what about our, our, our financial budget.
A:	Well, you, you should have a lot of information on a budget, then, if you're, uh,
B:	I wish I did.
B:	I, I hope you're, you're a person who does things better than,
B:	I, I don't have a budget.
B:	That's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good, oh, long-range planning budget mode.
B:	Um, I'm a single mom
B:	and I've been just, uh, trying to get,
A:	Well, you, you, you deserve an honor for that, a gold star for that, I guess
B:	Thank you,
B:	it's nice to have someone understand that.
A:	Right,
A:	sure.
B:	how about yourself,
B:	do you have a budget you live by?
A:	Well, I guess I do,
A:	I do have a long-term budget
A:	I got a daughter in college and one going to be in college
A:	so that, I've been thinking about that for quite a while.
A:	Now monthly, no.
A:	I'll tell you a funny story about budgeting,
A:	and I've been married twenty-six years
A:	and I did, you know, that the macho thing,
A:	the man always did the bills for, I don't know, fifteen years or more,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I got so sick of it, trying to balance the budget, uh, one,
A:	and I always tried to show my wife, you know, here's how you,
A:	once a year I'd say, here's how you do the budget in case I get sick,
A:	or here's how you do the checks, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	One day I gave her the checkbook
A:	and I said, I'm not doing this anymore.
A:	You do it,
A:	you learn it,
A:	and I've been happy ever since.
B:	Well, that's great.
B:	How about your,
A:	She does it all now for about ten years,
A:	and I don't even,
A:	she complains to me about it,
A:	she threatens me to give it back to me,
A:	and I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't, fooled with that checkbook, you know
B:	Oh.
A:	So I know it's a big pain to try to do that.
B:	It really is.
B:	It, it really is.
B:	You know, that was always a, a major problem in our marriage.
B:	What I have always identified is I am basically good with money.
B:	It, I don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it.
B:	I, think that comes from never having enough.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, I'm always afraid of I'm going to need some and where will it be.
A:	Right,
A:	oh, yeah.
B:	So, um, no,
B:	I, I've, I've finally worked myself into a spot where I can budget.
B:	When I, when I was first divorced, I had, um, I sat down and budgeted
B:	and I had outgo that was much higher than what I had coming in.
A:	Yes,
A:	I think, uh, that that is a tough, uh,
A:	we all,
A:	seems to seems to be that way.
B:	I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me,
B:	and, and so now that I've gotten, you know, I lost the house. Now that I've gotten past that, I can sit down and say, okay,
A:	Yeah.
B:	this is the reality.
B:	This is how much money I have each month.
B:	The scary thing is, as far as long term, I don't have anything.
B:	I don't know if you have an I R A or, uh, you know,
B:	and I've got two girls, also,
B:	and I haven't saved anything for their college
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, you need to do that. I'll, I'll, I'll give you a hint.
A:	I don't know if you're a a radio talk, uh, person listener.
A:	Do you listen to radio talk shows?
B:	Sometimes I have.
A:	Listen to Bruce Williams, uh, for financial advice.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He's on, oh,
A:	I don't know what he's going to be in Austin.
A:	He's on five seventy here.
A:	oh,
A:	he's nationally famous.
A:	He's a college graduate type guy.
A:	He's been in all,
A:	he's an entrepreneur
A:	and he gives very practical financial advice about cars, very, you know, not, not nothing college level, basic stuff.
A:	His name is Bruce Williams,
A:	he's on national radio.
A:	Uh, I don't know, what it would be down there.
A:	You might want to,
A:	whatever your radio talk shows are down there, he's on that channel.
A:	It's, uh, it's five seventy up here.
B:	Well, I'll check that out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'd listen to talk shows for everything, for gardening and everything, just when I'm doing chores,
A:	and, uh, he gives a wealth of information, very practical stuff
B:	You've learned a lot.
A:	and, and he will help you avoid a lot of little things, uh, financially.
B:	Well, that's, that's good to know how,
A:	Yeah,
A:	there, there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget.
A:	And I, I'm not expert, again, because, I don't really do it monthly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, you must have done something.
B:	You're, you're helping your children in school
B:	and you're you know.
A:	Right.
A:	I did start a college fund.
A:	I'm not, uh, I have one again at U T down there now, her first year,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she's almost gone through her whole college fund, you know
B:	Excuse me, Jim,
B:	could you hold on?
B:	I have someone at the door.
A:	Sure, go ahead.
B:	I'll be right back.
A:	Sure.
B:	in Thank you.
B:	I think we might have just screwed up the computer
B:	but we'll find out.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	yeah,
A:	right ,
A:	they give us ten minutes, uh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, the only advice I give you on college would be, there's a lot of scholarship money out there.
A:	My daughter got a little bit, not much, only first year
A:	she got about two thousand dollars worth,
A:	and you ought to, well, as your daughters approach the college age, uh, start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there
A:	and, uh,
B:	And, and how did your daughter get scholarship money on?
A:	Uh, band.
A:	She got, you know, five hundred dollars at a, at a clip through bands, through leadership.
A:	Uh, there's all kinds of civic organizations that will give you, you know, one shot money.
A:	Uh, you get a president's award if you're, you're in, in high school doing
A:	this up by, here in Arlington. Uh,
A:	there's a lot of,
A:	and, of course, you, if you, you score high on the S A T, you can get, you know, two thousand a year, you know, or more.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow.
A:	You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades.
A:	She, she did very well in school
A:	and, uh, but she only got first year money.
A:	She got about two thousand dollars.
A:	It was only five hundred, dollars at a clip from this organization.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We called.
A:	There were, there were two or three people,
A:	there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away
A:	and only two or three people applied.
A:	She applied and got five hundred dollars from that.
B:	Wow,
A:	So, look into that bit,
B:	oh, I'm definitely going to be actively looking into that.
A:	The year that they graduate, you know, before, though, you know, while they're graduating , there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away, churches and everything,
A:	and they don't even have a dozen applicants because, uh, uh, the kids are going off after the big money.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, of course, you have to have some sort of record in high school, uh, of, of achievement and everything,
A:	but sometimes it's just, uh,
A:	like our band gave money away.
A:	We're a band booster club.
A:	We gave, we give, uh, two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids, uh, who we think were worthy, you know
A:	so, There's money out there.
B:	Well, that's great to know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's good.
A:	Go ahead,
A:	you can talk.
A:	I, I don't want to, I want to chew up the whole line here.
B:	Oh, well, you're doing, you're doing just fine,
B:	and, and, uh, actually I, when I talk I usually like to ask a lot of questions.
B:	I was wondering what you do at T I.
A:	Oh, I'm an engineer.
A:	I'm, uh, in fact, I'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything.
A:	Uh, my job,
A:	there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved
A:	and so they put me on nights.
A:	I, I call this my recession job.
B:	Oh, goodness.
A:	And I'm working nights just kind of covering, uh, shutdown equipment and everything, and just being available, here.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't mind.
A:	Uh, it beats being laid off and everything.
A:	And, uh, you, you got to be a little flexible.
B:	Oh, absolutely.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school
A:	and then I'd like to teach, maybe mathematics or something.
A:	I'm trying to study for that now.
B:	Oh, I hope you can do that.
A:	Right, uh,
B:	What, what I did is
B:	I was approached
B:	and, and I've, I went to T I just right at the time that, uh, my marriage was ending.
B:	I had been a, a stay at home mom
B:	and, and I, I was very fortunate in starting,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I really enjoyed it while I was at T I,
B:	but, you know, the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening
B:	and I had less than five years
B:	and, also, I wanted to make a little bit more money.
B:	So I decided I'd like to go out and try sales.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And, uh, I'm, I'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses.
A:	Right.
B:	And the potential there is fantastic.
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	The reality of it is it's tough
A:	Well, it's tough right now for everybody.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful.
A:	Hey, I've got another clue for you for college.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Another clue for you for college money.
B:	Okay.
A:	Go to work for U T.
A:	Uh, we have a friend who works, who is a secretary for T C U, you know, up here?
B:	Yes.
A:	They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, if you're, if you work for T C U.
B:	They do?
A:	Yes.
A:	So check that one out, you know.
B:	I'm going to check that.
B:	I've got, I've got two friends that work at, at U T.
B:	I didn't know that all.
A:	Ask them about it.
A:	Call them.
B:	Definitely, I will.
A:	And, because it's full, full scholarship.
A:	Now, it's, uh, not room and board,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U.
B:	Well, that sounds fantastic.
A:	And her, her mother went over there just for that ...
A:	Well Brent, I've been, um, I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought, uh, if it, it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school.
B:	Right.
A:	And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make, because, um, it was important to me to, to spend some time with kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know that when I was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was, it was really hard on our family because I would, he would come home
A:	and I would leave,
B:	Right.
A:	and then when I would come home
A:	and he would leave,
A:	and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know,
A:	someone came home
A:	and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something.
A:	It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family.
A:	So there's one or two nights a week, we have a,
A:	on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening
A:	and we stay home that evening, all of us,
A:	and we do things together.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You must be a .
A:	Yes.
B:	So am I.
A:	Oh, you are?
B:	Yes,
B:	what a coincidence.
A:	Yes
A:	and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know what family home evening's all about.
A:	So you do that
A:	and, right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	and then the family home evening, too.
A:	Right,
A:	and then, you know, sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday
A:	but, We're, it's real important to us to spend time together.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that's good.
B:	Um, how many children do you have?
A:	I have two.
B:	Two?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have a girl and a boy,
A:	and the boy's five,
A:	he's in kindergarten,
A:	and the girl is four.
A:	She'll be in kindergarten next year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have two daughters.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My oldest is, uh, four
B:	and my youngest is about to turn three.
B:	Two girls.
B:	And they are a handful
A:	They are a handful.
B:	Yes.
B:	We've, my, uh, well, when we first got married, my wife worked for a year.
B:	Then we decided to have kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, she, she got pregnant
B:	and then we decided she would stay home with the kids.
B:	We would make that sacrifice.
B:	It is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we made that decision
B:	and, uh, so after she had the first baby, she stayed home.
B:	And, and we had a second baby
B:	and she's still at home
A:	Yes.
B:	And so, uh, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know,
B:	I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in.
B:	Most of them, uh, continue to work if they have, have kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I only have one other person I know in my, in my group here that works where the wife stays home,
B:	and that's because of religious values as well.
B:	They're Baptists
B:	and they, and they think that's important.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But everybody else works
B:	and they drop their kids off at day-care and, and leave them
B:	and, I don't know, I just don't want, I just don't want strangers raising my children.
A:	Well, no,
A:	and it's, it's just not, um, it's not as stable for the kids,
B:	Right.
A:	and they, everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now.
A:	But, uh, it's, yeah.
B:	That's how it is at our house when you're on the phone.
B:	Oh, it's open,
B:	anything goes when mom's on the phone
A:	Well, it's also important, I think, um, for my husband.
A:	I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, um, some time with them.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,
B:	Right.
A:	and he reads to them,
B:	Right.
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that,
A:	and that's, that's pretty good quality time, with them,
B:	Right.
A:	and, um, but it's hard for him on Saturdays.
A:	He, he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,
B:	With all the yard work and things like that.
A:	and so, um, I try to say, well, why don't you go fly kites
A:	or why don't you do something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	we feel that, you know, just spending time together.
B:	You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, you know, that costs money or, or, you know, that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that.
B:	It's just the kids like to, being together as a family.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run
B:	and so we took the kids and, and went by the Farmers Market down in, in, down there in Garland.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the, you know, the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out.
B:	And they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they liked that.
B:	And then on the way home we drove by the local high school
B:	and there happened to be an F A, F A A, Future F A, Future Farmers of America, F F A going on there,
A:	Yes.
B:	and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in this, in the, in this schoolyard there.
B:	So we just said, hey, let's stop
B:	and and the kids got to go around and, you know, see pigs and animals and things like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and for them that's wonderful, you know.
B:	They, they thought it was the greatest fun, you know,
B:	and it didn't cost any money.
B:	And, uh, you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.
A:	Well, that's right.
A:	But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends are that, um, the family unit is devaluated.
A:	It's not nearly as important.
B:	Right.
A:	We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And families took care of themselves
A:	and, um, but now, you know, people don't, they don't support each other that way.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, definitely motherhood is devalued in this society.
B:	If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's like what a waste. People think, you know, you should be fulfilling yourself
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and a mother isn't an important important thing as, as having a career
A:	That's right
A:	and,
B:	and, and that should be first and, and children second.
B:	But they don't have kind of an, what we call an internal perspective of things.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
B:	But that,
A:	And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, I, you know, I have interests that, too,
B:	No.
B:	Right.
A:	and it is hard to make, uh, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
B:	Uh, at this point.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work.
B:	My mother's a school teacher
B:	and when, when we started, uh, having kids, she had to work for a little while,
B:	but then she just started substituting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So she would just substitute once or twice a week, you know, just for that little extra money when we were in school.
B:	Then we would just come home and just be, you know, go to a neighbor's house for an hour,
B:	then she'd be home.
B:	But she wouldn't do that every day.
A:	Right.
B:	But now that my, my, uh, youngest sister's at B Y U now,
B:	and so they have no one at home,
B:	she's back teaching school full time now, again.
B:	So if, you know, it's not, it's just a temporary thing.
A:	It is temporary.
A:	It, in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but you're right,
A:	it is temporary.
A:	Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and, in spite of,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	you, it's, it's hard sometimes at work because, you know, people say, oh, we're taking a cruise,
B:	we're going here,
B:	we're going there, you know because they have a lot more money.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And a lot of them decide just not to have children.
A:	Yes.
B:	It's, it's amazing, they either have one or none.
A:	That's true.
B:	And, and the one person I know that has one, they, they feel guilty.
B:	She has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing,
B:	and so on, uh, on weekends she would, you know, spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots of, lots and lots of money.
B:	Basically, I think they, they really spoil the child, to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think, you know, that, she doesn't think she could be a mother at home.
B:	That's not her bag.
B:	So she just doesn't think that she could, you know,
B:	the guilt feelings, she can't deal with with it anymore
A:	Yeah.
B:	so,
A:	Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
B:	You know,
A:	and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my wife, uh, likes staying home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, she works at home some, though.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The place she works with, worked with before, um, worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home, part time,
A:	Well, that's good.
B:	and so, uh, that, it's kind of a seasonal thing.
B:	Three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but the rest of the time she's free.
B:	She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that
B:	So she enjoys staying at home,
B:	but, uh, the money part of it is not as rewarding, obviously,
B:	but there's different rewards, you know, different kinds of rewards.
A:	No.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so.
A:	I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious.
A:	You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	right.
B:	And you really have to make, uh, quite a bit of money.
B:	The wife doesn't make it worth it, with the cost of day-care.
A:	Yes.
B:	I know there's, you know,
B:	when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care, you know, you're only making like five.
A:	Here we go.
B:	Okay,
B:	um, now we're supposed to talk about social activities.
B:	Right?
A:	Well, the changes that's occurred,
A:	like it, how was it, maybe ten, twenty, thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten, twenty, or whatever you remember it to be.
B:	I think, um, well, I guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation.
B:	I think your generation is, um,
B:	what do I say, uh,
B:	uh, they're, they're, they're polite,
B:	they have more respect for, other people, just in, in general I think, and just, just towards people and property
B:	and, um, I, I guess they would, would be more conservative, some of them I guess.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we are, uh, somewhat conservative,
A:	but as far as the, uh, socially, our crime rate has increased,
A:	and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, our prison population has significantly increased I would say.
A:	Um, our economy, too, is really, it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what I've read,
A:	and uh, even the,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, it started spiraling down, I suppose, in the seventies,
A:	and, uh, our recovery, uh, economically has not been like it used to be.
A:	To me, also, our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I don't, I don't know if, uh,
A:	can't make any judgments of that nature,
A:	but, uh, I don't really want to either because I have no problems about it either way
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, kids are, I, I suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to
B:	Yes, I agree with,
A:	women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they don't no longer feel dependent upon men,
B:	Well, Well, do you think that that maybe,
B:	I mean, uh, I've heard different, you know, like, um, like
B:	I know my mom and like other ladies, they complain because they think that, um, the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids.
A:	That's probably true,
A:	I mean, they, they are, a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands,
A:	and, uh, I guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, in fact, uh, there was one lady in this area,
A:	she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day.
B:	Oh my gosh, just a baby.
A:	Not a baby, she was old enough to, uh,
A:	I would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range,
B:	Oh my gosh.
A:	but that's just an extreme example.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would imagine, you know, the situations are out there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um,
B:	Well, um, um, well, I think the education, like our education has, um, increased dramatically,
B:	but then I think also that we're forgetting like basic things, like we should know
A:	I agree there.
B:	like I, I think, well, um, in the morals and values of like my generation for the most, for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys, um, values of like per se your generation.
B:	But I think as we get older, it gets to your, you know what I mean.
B:	I think the kids now are, are, I would say, louder now until after they reach like twenty-five,
B:	and then I think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, I could agree with that, because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	because I think we're given more now, whereas you had to work for everything,
B:	and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work,
B:	and, you know, and they, they don't have any intent to go working until they have to.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's an agreeable topic there
A:	Um, what else considering beside family, economics, um,
A:	our transportation system has changed for us.
A:	I mean, we can, we can now travel around the world in no time.
A:	It's just a hop, skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, well, I, I think what's happened, too, is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up, aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there, we got to constantly read, go to school, uh,
A:	T V watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because T V is still, well,
A:	the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a lot of other, a variety of programs out there, as well as use of the V C R
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that, I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system.
B:	I don't know, because I know I don't watch, while I'm up here at school, I don't watch hardly any T V.
B:	Like Thursday night I like to sit down and watch a few shows,
B:	but I,
A:	Do you watch L A LAW?
B:	No,
B:	I don't watch that
B:	I used to,
B:	but I don't any more.
A:	I like that.
B:	But, all,
B:	I mean there are, even though there's a few up here, we call them couch potatoes,
B:	they love to sit in front of the T V,
B:	I
B:	but for the most part, I will, I will,
B:	well, I live in an all girls dorm,
B:	but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty-one
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and there isn't really a lot of T V watching.
A:	Well, that's good,
A:	at least you're hitting the books, right.
B:	They're either hitting the books or something else,
B:	I don't know what,
B:	but, I know, oh, well, I guess, they have their crowds, like during the soap operas, you know, like in between classes or something
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the T V all day.
A:	Well, that's a change then,
A:	oh, of course, going to school, too, it's different from the home environment,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	but, then, um, like I know this girl.
B:	She's doing her student teaching
B:	or she's just working like within the school,
B:	and, um, yesterday she was at the kindergarten,
B:	and there's this little boy,
B:	he like didn't want to do anything,
B:	and he said I'm not doing this,
B:	I don't like it,
B:	and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand, and pretend like he's playing Nintendo you know,
A:	Um.
B:	so, uh, I don't know how,
B:	I mean, I never really watched that, a lot of T V when I was younger,
B:	but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much T V,
B:	so I don't know.
A:	I agree with your parents, because, uh, T V kind of ruined me,
A:	because that's that's all that we had
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well, not really,
A:	but, I mean, it's, uh, for the top medium of entertainment.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we watch a lot of, I guess we watched a lot of T V in the Winter time,
B:	but in the Summer, like right now, my mom, well, like she doesn't let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night, you know,
A:	Even at your age?
B:	Well, like my younger brothers and sisters at home.
B:	Like when it starts getting nice outside in the Summer and everything she'll, she makes us go outside,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	even now when I go home for the Summer, she makes us go outside,
B:	and we're allowed to come in and watch T V until it's dark, because she doesn't like the T V herself
A:	I see.
B:	and if it was up to her, we wouldn't have one.
B:	So, you know, she feels that kids are too dependent on it also.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh. Is there anything else?
B:	Um.
A:	Um.
B:	What about in our work ethics?
A:	Work ethics, oh,
B:	I,
A:	It's it's maybe getting better. Um, a little,
A:	of course, we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that, well, the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I think, I think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us because we have so much to pay for now.
B:	Um.
A:	It's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others including what's left of ours
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I really can't think of anything else.
A:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
B:	It was nice talking to you too.
A:	And, uh, what are majoring in?
A:	Hi, this is Judy,
A:	I'm from Maryland
A:	and I'm in California visiting right now.
B:	Hi, Judy.
B:	This is Norma,
B:	and I live in Virginia
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	We got a great topic
A:	I know.
A:	I'm sitting here going oh, dear
A:	Should we give it a try?
B:	I guess we might as well
A:	Okay
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well, um, so
B:	Let you start
A:	So, so what changes have you seen?
B:	What changes, uh,
B:	I guess the biggest,
B:	I don't know your age Judy,
B:	but, uh, in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working,  definitely.
A:	Well, actually,  that's what I was thinking too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, um, you know, just to jump ahead a little bit
A:	but then we can back up.
A:	Is it, perhaps, woman in politics is for the future.
B:	For the well, yeah.
A:	Because I don't see that really yet in positions of power, really.
B:	Right.
B:	I don't see them in positions of power in corporation either
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	not many.
A:	That's true.
A:	That's true.
A:	Um, do you work in private corporation or government?
B:	I did work in government.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And before that I worked in a bank for eight years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And now I'm retired.
A:	Oh, you,
A:	That's the best status.
B:	That's right.
A:	Yes, um,
A:	I don't, I see, um,
A:	and,
B:	Which do you work in, excuse me?
A:	A government.
B:	A government.
A:	And I work in academia before.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, actually there's one, um, woman in our, I don't know what you'd call it, uh, institute who is a manager
A:	and, I mean, in a since, perhaps, um, a lot of, she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, and it's sort of unfortunate because, I think that they don't accept her technically
A:	and, but she's a good paper pusher.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's in a technical position really.
A:	And you know she should be more technical for what she does.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think that's sort of unfortunate,  because it doesn't, it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
B:	Right.
A:	But, um, you know, I don't know.
A:	And, and teaching I still see that that's where most of the woman are.
B:	In teaching.
A:	In teaching.
A:	And, you know, and it's always been that way.
B:	But not at the college level.
A:	Right.
A:	Not, well,
B:	We live in a college town
B:	and I worked at the university for a while.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there are, there are woman there
B:	but they're not the high paid  professors that,  the men are
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Not department,  chairmen.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Not the deans and things like that.
B:	Well, they did have one woman dean
B:	but, and I guess she, she probably did very well
B:	but that's the minority.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or, or just don't, or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs.
B:	None of the above
B:	I think they are extremely well qualified.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't know how,
A:	They're just not selected somehow.
B:	I think they're not selected,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, of course, at this university, uh,
B:	this, it's a big engineering school
B:	and I don't think there are many women in the engineering college.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's where the high pay is.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	But I'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering.
A:	but, you know, I say that
A:	but yet I know too.
B:	Quite an,
B:	well, I think there are more than there used to be.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm sure there are, yeah.
B:	But they may not go into teaching,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, the two that I know obviously are not in teaching
A:	but,  um, it's, I suppose in a since I was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know why.
A:	I, but I don't know that many men that have majored in engineering,  either.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean it's just, because I'm in the humanities it's just,
B:	Oh, uh-huh
A:	You know, it's not,  it's not something that I tend to hear about.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, yeah,
A:	it's a,
B:	Well, I met one one day that, uh, had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering
B:	and that really surprised me.
A:	Oh, that's interesting,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, I, I suppose that, that it's difficult to really say why because, uh, you know, there, there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And maybe there aren't, you know,
A:	Maybe they don't apply for the job.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I don't, I don't know how many go on and get a P H D in engineering.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Which could be, you know, partially cultural anyway.
B:	That could be.
B:	That's true.
A:	So that it might be circularly being the same problem of, of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so why spend your time getting qualified.
B:	That's right.
A:	It's a, it's a rough It's a rough, a rough situation.
A:	Um, and I guess what I, what, amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids
A:	or and, in our case we actually have one father who works part-time, a six,  hour day so that he can take the kids, kids or kid, I'm not sure,  to school in the morning and be home when the children or child,  comes home in the afternoon.
B:	Oh.
B:	That's interesting,
B:	Is it, uh, was she the major wage earner,
A:	This is, uh,
B:	I mean, did she earn more money that he did
B:	or  you know.
A:	Well, see,  I don't know anything about the family
A:	but, but, yeah,
A:	I would imagine she might. Um,
A:	because he's, you know, he's a really nice guy
A:	but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	So that maybe he, you know, maybe she was more qualified.
A:	But, but still it's interesting that, you know, he,  he's been doing this evidently for a, a good number of years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, but it's unusual.
B:	Uh, I know one, uh, gal
B:	that's, she's a C P A,
B:	and her husband is a house husband.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	I,
B:	And then they had a child
B:	and he, he was still the house husband.
B:	He wasn't,  going to,
A:	Oh, he was,  even before they had children.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even before that,
B:	right.
A:	Oh, now that, that really is
B:	She was a little perturbed about it.
A:	Oh, she was.
B:	At one time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know how, she's moved away. I don't know how it is now
B:	but I know, uh, we're, we all went out one evening
B:	and after work and, uh, she was, there was an underlying note she was perturbed about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean I think that would be, it would, it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't think there was a valid reason
A:	Yeah
A:	That's true.
B:	Because her statement was, I told him let's face it
B:	you're a house husband
B:	that's what your going, that's what you'll always be.
A:	But, but yet, you know we have to think about that
A:	because if, if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything
B:	She wouldn't have be,
B:	that's right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's right.
A:	So, so we're,  carrying our own prejudice
B:	it would, it wouldn't have been a doubter .
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, gee.
A:	I guess we can't win
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Because if, yeah, if, if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised.
A:	But if
B:	That's right
A:	Oh, dear.
A:	So, so,
B:	I think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly
A:	If they could get away with it
A:	Oh, dear.
A:	You know, well, uh, I mean it, it's an interesting topic
A:	yet I must say it's not one that I've given a great deal of,  of thought to
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	but, uh,  in the past.
B:	No,
B:	I didn't.
A:	It's, um, one of those things that, you know, seems to happen.
B:	How do you feel your career has gone?
A:	I don't, I don't feel for the most part that I've been discriminated against.
B:	You don't.
B:	That's good.
A:	No.
A:	I was a department chairman.
A:	I, but I don't like administration.
B:	Oh.
A:	So then I'm, uh, uh, probably a poor example, although, you know, I was an administrator and could still be I suppose.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I was discriminated against very definitely in banking.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was terrible.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	You were, you were more ambitious than they would let you be?
B:	Right.
B:	And the money didn't go with the positions.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I would,
B:	The promotion, promotions came
B:	but there there comparable pay for the responsibility.
A:	Uh,
B:	And I was told you don't need as much pay as I have because your children are older than my children,
B:	or your husband has a good job
B:	and
A:	Oh, jeez.
A:	Yeah,
A:	actually in a since I suppose, when I was hired into the government, um, at, I was taken advantage of
A:	and, and that's true that, you know, sometimes other people get, get higher increments,  for, you know, even,
B:	I
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I think we, uh, are programmed to just take it as it comes.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	That's probably true.
A:	I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it because I do like what I do
A:	and,  uh, I just sort of ignore the administrative,  part of it since I didn't like it when, when I had to do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I, I figure, you know, nobody must, uh, nobody must like it.
A:	It must be a rotten job for everybody
A:	But I know some people thrive on it
A:	Oh, gee.
A:	Well, since I don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic.
B:	I don't,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, um, this is a tough subject because, uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, uh, the political views are really different.
A:	I, uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion
A:	but like gun control and, uh, day care an things like that,
A:	and there are some very different views, uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.
B:	Well, now you, you say two different parts of the country
B:	what, are, are, are you referring to yourself
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well being in, in Baltimore see,
A:	Maryland is, um, is sort of, um, is as, as a hub of liberalism  you know, compared to the country, uh,
A:	you know, very, uh, in, in many ways, uh, very liberal
A:	very somewhat to New England
A:	though Pennsylvania and New York, uh, I, aren't actually as liberal,
A:	Maryland is a very liberal, uh, state
A:	so, so, where here we have, um, we have gun control laws
A:	we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation
A:	and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it really is a different, um,
B:	Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas
B:	and you're asking to be lynched.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, that's right talk to,
A:	I had to talk about gun control with somebody
A:	and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day,  and was going target shooting, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was very different
A:	it was a whole,  different view.
A:	It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know,
A:	at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that
A:	because I'd really never met people that did,
A:	and now, I talk to people that do.
A:	So that's, it's really interesting.
B:	Well, it's very true,
B:	now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh,
B:	I have two sons living down there
B:	but I also have two sons living elsewhere,  one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I lived in in Florida for ten years
B:	and I kind of like it down there,
B:	but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think uh,
B:	well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal.
A:	Yeah,
A:	isn't it funny.
B:	I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they uh quickly did away with it.
A:	Uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think in the next session they they uh modified it
B:	but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida.
A:	Yeah
A:	well you can possess 'em here too
A:	but They have to be they're registered
A:	and Uh, like uh the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues,
B:	The the one week uh seven day the delay
A:	You have the seven day waiting period.
B:	Uh huh.
A:	Yeah
B:	Well I don't mind that too much
A:	that's uh that's
B:	I'm I'm with the N R A myself.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little
B:	and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
A:	Yeah
A:	that's true
A:	that's very true
A:	That's and that's the way I guess most of the um the political organizations work you know
A:	the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose
B:	Yeah.
A:	and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know
A:	there's there's always that difficulty
B:	Well then tell me
B:	do you consider yourself a liberal?
A:	Um I would say I'm probably liberal
A:	yeah
B:	Well let me ask you this then.
A:	yeah
A:	Sure
B:	How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
A:	Well I'll tell you.
A:	I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen
A:	do you know what I mean?
B:	Huh.
A:	It's only because they make a big stink over it.
A:	But I I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity
A:	They're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech
A:	But I would never
B:	Well now wait a minute there
A:	Yeah.
B:	you just said it.
B:	It's their right by freedom of speech?
B:	What does speech have to do with burning a flag?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well it's
A:	that they
A:	I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to
A:	and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know
A:	the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh,
A:	though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself
A:	I I I think uh you know
A:	but I I still
A:	what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed
A:	uh
B:	Now uh Well I I still go back to ...
A:	Unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know
A:	but I I think that's I guess that's I that's my opinion
A:	Yeah
A:	I guess you feel differently.
B:	Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
A:	Uh, no
A:	but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money.
A:	If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine
A:	but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.
B:	Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.
A:	No
A:	I don't know
A:	I guess the symbolism
A:	oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.
B:	Uh yeah
A:	Uh I think that's what's made democracy
B:	but here again I go back to the second amendment
B:	You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well that's that's true
B:	Now I am I am adamantly against that.
A:	Yeah
A:	But I think I I
A:	Yeah
A:	I I I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers.
A:	Um. there uh one of the Republican the appointees for the the judicial bench
A:	and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in
B:	huh.
A:	my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government
A:	and you can display that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I Yeah,
A:	I
A:	and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable.
A:	Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think.
A:	Yeah
A:	Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right
B:	No.
A:	And I would never do it.
A:	I I love this country too much,
A:	and that symbol means a lot to me.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um. But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.
B:	Well here again we uh
B:	even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	No.
B:	Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh huh.
B:	Uh, um so long as it's their possession.
B:	Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,
A:	Uh huh.
B:	and I used to know as a Boy Scout
B:	but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.
A:	I agree there too.
A:	I agree with you there too.
A:	I I the um I I it's I find it you know personally disgusting
A:	But I don't think that I don't think that uh we have a right to stop somebody from that you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the same I don't know
A:	I guess I get I get uh all mixed up inside. when, Yeah
B:	It's It's very easy to do.
A:	it when it's uh it's an emotional issue,
A:	and you sit
A:	and you try and think about it logically
A:	and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing,
A:	uh but logically um
A:	even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know
A:	I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion,
A:	but they would vote pro choice.
B:	Uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know
A:	somebody
A:	an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know
B:	Well I think it should be permitted under certain
A:	but
A:	Yeah.
A:	but it that's uh that's what I mean,
A:	see,
A:	but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing,
A:	and it evokes an emotional response.
A:	I think that's the hardest thing,
A:	I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well tell me
B:	has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human?
A:	No,
A:	no
A:	I think the um
A:	sometimes I guess
A:	what did I read recently
A:	the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception
A:	but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term.
A:	And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.
B:	Huh.
A:	so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then.
A:	So it's
A:	I don't know.
A:	It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world
A:	and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a,
B:	Or they
B:	on their within the own uh society, it can vary.
A:	Yeah
A:	and how Yeah
A:	how it'll sway from one one extreme to another.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh I think that uh you know I I just read something I think in TIME magazine uh about um protest
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
A:	because it, it seems like
A:	and I'm, I'm thinking of the of community of people that are in jail now,
A:	I think that maybe if, if, if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community, gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done
A:	because they, they understand people more,
A:	they understand helping people more,
A:	they understand the plight of people.
B:	That's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I agree with you in the sense that, uh, I think that it's important for people to, uh, also share, give something of themselves
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, I think that there's too much in the, in, in a way of self-gratification today,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and there's not enough sharing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would think that for, like people that are just filthy, filthy rich,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see
A:	and I'm, I'm speaking about people that are like born rich,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's all they know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm thinking that community service would help them, uh, just get a feel of what else is out there, how other people are living, you know,
A:	if they were to work in, in a, a, I don't know, a soup kitchen or something, they would understand how other people live
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, you know, on the same note if poor, if poorer people, uh, are working to, to serve the community, I don't know, they probably have a better perspective of, of life itself.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	and I think the Peace Corps is great too, because, uh, it, you go to different countries
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you see,
B:	uh, in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with, uh, Patrick Swayze,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he's making a movie in, I think it's, uh, Calcutta or either India, somewhere where it's, it's a very poor, poor country,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he said that people in the west,
B:	he said since being there and I guess he's been there about six months,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed,
A:	Um.
B:	and he said that people have no idea, he said, of, of what human sacrifice is, you know,
B:	since being there he's, he's learned to, what it is to be poor and have nothing
B:	and yet those people have, uh, such, uh, a happy, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	demeanor,
A:	yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	in, in other words they don't dwell on, on what they don't have.
A:	Right.
B:	they dwell on what they do have
B:	and they're happy with each other type of thing.
A:	That's great.
B:	He said that out here, he said that when he comes back he knows that it, it's completely changed his life.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	and I, I think that that, you know,
A:	this, on the same note being
A:	he was exposed to that
A:	and maybe he wasn't before,
B:	Right.
A:	and now he sees,
B:	Exactly.
A:	and I think that anybody that works in the, in some kind of service or for the community or something, they can see, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You don't see what, you don't, you can't know what you don't see, you know,
B:	Exactly right.
A:	so and you have to experience some things.
A:	You know a lot of people know that people, that other people are poor
A:	but you, they don't know what poor is, unless they actually see it and, you know, help or something.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well I, I know that it, that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of, uh, you know, helping them learn how to survive, how to plant, how to find water
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I've seen so many, uh, extraordinary things on T V, that people have done working in the Peace Corps and how, you know, uh, the people of the community they worked in is so much better,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's like one person can make a difference,
A:	Right.
B:	and I, I really believe that they can in something like that.
A:	There's something I, I've really be skeptical of, you know,
A:	you watch television
A:	you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries
A:	and, if you want to send like, you know, fifty cents a day, or something like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	and you can help a child.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's, I don't know, I guess it's just me
A:	but I don't know whether to trust that or not,
A:	I mean there are so many scams, and things going on, you know,
B:	I know
B:	and how do
A:	I would love to help somebody, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but I just, I can't bring myself to trust this, this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is, you know,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	just because people or so, I don't know, just today people are just so money hungry, that I think they would do anything,
B:	I know.
B:	It's true,
B:	it really is.
A:	and so you don't know what they,
B:	It's the sad life I think today.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, uh, it's, it's not like it used to be even in, in the years of my growing up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean I'm fifty-three years old,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its, uh, people, you know, grow from a small town to a large town,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you would think that more people would be better, you know share more, do more, you know, be more community oriented and all,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but if they just get more, uh, unto themselves kind of,
A:	More self-centered, uh-huh.
B:	right
B:	and, and it's not the sharing of, uh, a neighbor to a neighbor
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But you can't do that today.
B:	But today, I mean, you know, it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Even when, when I first moved to Dallas from New York, it seemed like Dallas was so open, you know,
A:	everybody left their, doors open,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you just run, in the store,
B:	Yeah.
A:	you leave your car running, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and this was only, uh,
A:	well I guess it has been awhile,
A:	it's been almost ten years since I moved here.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's amazing now how much it's changed.
A:	I mean I don't go out I don't go,  outside at night, you know.
B:	In Dallas I,
B:	I was going to say
B:	cause I, I heard I, in fact I was talking to someone from Dallas, uh, just last week
B:	and they was saying that, uh,
B:	in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for T I,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she had gone overseas to Tokyo,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she asked them there if there was some, anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone, you know being a girl from another country, and everything
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she said they thought for a few seconds
B:	and they said, uh, no,
B:	there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay, that she would have that purse returned to her, this is how confident they were, okay, with nothing missing
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Wow.
A:	Wow.
B:	okay,
B:	this is a foreign country
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you would think, you know, uh, being, uh, an American or whatever, you know, a foreigner there that, that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh God,
A:	that would be the exact opposite of here.
B:	Okay.
A:	I mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it.
B:	And she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in, in and around Dallas,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's where she was from.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That is sad.
B:	She said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	That's,  a big, that's a big thing with me.
B:	You know she had,
B:	there are certain.
A:	I live in a one bedroom,
A:	I'm single,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I've, I could live in an apartment,
A:	I live in Waco, okay,
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I live,
A:	I don't make a lot of money
A:	but I live in the high price apartments simply because I feel safe here
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I pay, I'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than I would be paying somewhere else
A:	but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I feel very safe where I am, you know,
A:	instead of,
B:	And that, that's why I think if people were more exposed to, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	especially, uh, young kids getting out of high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean at one time they would go into the service, to have the same exposure and, you know, uh, to further their worldliness, so to speak. And go to see, uh, foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it was like they said,
B:	join the Navy to see the world type of thing, you know,
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	but nowadays, they don't do that anymore.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It's not a, a thing a,
B:	a lot of young men don't even, uh, have the desire to go into the service.  Or to, uh, you know, do something for someone else.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they don't even consider it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't know
B:	I attributed I think, a lot of that to women working. You know, to mothers not being at home.
A:	To,
A:	Yes!
A:	Yes!
A:	I was talking to someone yesterday about that.
B:	the bonding process,
B:	yeah.
A:	And we were saying that the basic, uh, the, the basic family is, is disrupted these days,
B:	It very definitely is.
A:	And so, I think, you know, before the father would work
A:	and the mother, you know, would stay home
A:	and having that mother there, that base, I think, was a big part of, of family, a big part of, of what, you know, your, your, uh, youngsters thought about, what they did, you know.
B:	That's right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And the thing is,
B:	like I think a man can afford to support a woman,
B:	but the woman affords the luxuries.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In, in other words like anyone can live, on a certain income no matter what it is,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	you have to, so to speak. Okay?
A:	Right.
B:	It, it's what's important to you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now a family,
B:	I, I think that like girls today, have children,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and six weeks later they're back to work.
A:	Right.
B:	They don't even have a bonding with that child,
B:	they, don't ever see the,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's, it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child. The first, like say, six, years of life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So much,  happens in that period of time,
A:	When I call,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three, big deal,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean they, they're in school,
B:	you're at work.
A:	Right.
B:	That's great.
B:	But it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and ...
A:	Right.
B:	Where you on the phone a long time?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
B:	Yeah.
A:	You were, he was waiting for what again?
B:	To,
B:	he called in to get somebody on the line,
B:	it took him about half an hour to find somebody.
A:	That's what this was
A:	yeah,
A:	well, let me go a head and push one
A:	okay?
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Well, basically I like comedy shows Uh, MURPHY BROWN, uh, DESIGNING WOMEN .
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
A:	what do you like?
B:	Well  we don't have a T V,
B:	I mean we have two T V
B:	but neither one of them work,
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	so for the last year,
B:	I mean we just got married
B:	and we decided well, for the first year we, we won't get a T V
B:	so I mean I'm totally out of it as far,  as T V goes.
A:	That's okay
A:	we'll been married eleven years
A:	and, um, we went through that after about five years of marriage,
A:	my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out
A:	and we went, we made it almost about eighteen months without a television.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, um, gee I needed that, you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic,  whatever all of those things,
B:	V C R, and everything else.
A:	oh, yeah,
A:	and then you never use the V C R,
A:	and now we have two of them
A:	and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean it's cause your never home, you know,
A:	you're working,
A:	you're at school.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I don't know T V shows,
A:	what can I tell you, um,
A:	basically junk that's on television
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's my opinion
A:	yeah,
A:	um, I like things like I just mentioned,
A:	have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that?
B:	I don't think so
A:	You don't think so,
A:	oh, that's the one with Candice Bergen in it, um,
B:	Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a half,
B:	so. I would never see any shows any way
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would do it.
B:	and then before that I was in college for four years
B:	and I never watched T V then because I didn't have time.
A:	Right,
A:	nobody does yeah, then,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	I know.
B:	I mean I did watch T V
B:	it was soaps and M T V cause the girls I lived with never changed the channels .
A:	And the, uh,
A:	well I don't,
A:	you're probably at least ten years younger then I am
A:	but I could tell you in school that, uh, the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was, uh, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And until then I never paid attention to soap operas.
B:	Me too.
A:	And to this day twenty years later I'm like, I'm in my thirties,
A:	I'm not that old,
A:	but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television
B:	I know,
B:	I mean I I almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else
B:	it, you know, it was like.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, you know,
A:	about the only other kinds of things I like, um,
A:	I like to watch a lot of news, um,
A:	don't you miss that with not having a television so far?
B:	Um.
A:	How long has it been since you've had one?
B:	Well, about, almost a year.
A:	Oh my God
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you've got about another six months
A:	and then you'll get one
B:	Well,  I mean I never really watched it much growing up
A:	By then,
B:	but I thought, you know, my husband would really like miss it because he, he was an only child
B:	and he he's seen a lot of T V.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I figured oh, no
B:	it will never last
B:	but. I mean I don't miss it that much.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my husband is an only child too
A:	and he did miss it
A:	that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months,
B:	That's funny.
A:	and I'm trying to think about the only other show I watch.
B:	I've seen CHEERS probably five times
B:	and I've seen COSBY SHOW probably ten times.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like COSBY,
A:	L A LAW is probably,
A:	I've seen CHEERS
A:	more then that I hate to admit
A:	but, uh,
B:	It's pretty cool
B:	I like that whenever I watch it.
A:	CHEERS?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I thought it was good,
A:	I've actually been to that bar in Boston
A:	it's a nice, you know, it's a pretty funny show.
B:	Oh, you have?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've heard it's pretty cool.
A:	It's just a, you know, over priced downtown,  Boston yuppie, you know,  tourist attraction.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm trying to think what else is on television,
A:	I know it's like.
B:	I watched a lot of T V when the war was on.
A:	Yeah,
A:	who didn't?
A:	Isn't that sad?
B:	And then, uh, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and,  and pro football,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean that sounds kind of stupid
B:	but,  I do like it.
A:	Oh not, no,  I like the pro, actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to,
A:	I watch pro football
A:	but I like the N B A play-offs,  back when like the Pistons were in them
B:	Yeah.
A:	and now,
A:	where are you calling from?
B:	Uh, Sherman, Texas.
A:	Sherman, Texas, oh,
B:	Where are you from?
A:	I'm in Dallas
A:	I was just saying where am I calling you from, you know,
A:	well then I don't know if you like the, the Mavericks or not,
A:	they haven't been that good this year.
A:	Um, we're supposed to talk about television
A:	let's see
A:	you don't have a T V.
B:	So, are you really from Texas though?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm talking to you from Dallas,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well, sounds like you're from up north.
A:	My voice you mean?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, no,
A:	that's just because I've moved around
A:	and, uh,  I'm originally from Pennsylvania,
B:	Oh.
A:	so.
B:	I was going to say.
B:	Cause I wondered if you really, you know, if had any teams you like watching from up north or something.
A:	Uh, actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Real big
A:	and, uh, um, I always watch them no matter who's on,
A:	of course you like them too, right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you?
B:	Well, I'm from Indiana.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so I like the Bears.
A:	Yeah,
A:	there you go,
A:	and then  and, um, I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise.
A:	I like,  I like tennis
B:	I watch, uh, huh.
A:	so I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years
A:	but, um, I just like to watch, you know,  two players really get, go at it,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It gets boring after a while
A:	but I don't,
A:	go ahead.
B:	I used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons,  before I went to work and stuff
A:	OPRAH
B:	and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, they have those T V right,  in front of the treadmills,
A:	Yeah,
A:	on the,  on the tracks
A:	yeah,
A:	is
B:	I don't know
B:	she's not as good as she use to be
B:	but,
A:	Maybe cause she got chubby again or something,
B:	her disposition's gone downhill.
A:	Was she, was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long?
B:	Was what?
A:	Was her show big when you where in college, since you,  haven't been that long?
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's pretty cool,
A:	Was it?
B:	I mean back then
B:	and the show, did you see the show where she lost all of that fat?
A:	Yeah
A:	I saw reruns of it,
B:	She she wheeled it out on a cart .
A:	I saw tapes of her
A:	yeah.
B:	That was so cool,
B:	and then man she's really porked out again I guess
B:	but,
A:	Gee, I know
A:	isn't that terrible.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know
A:	I guess with that money who cares
A:	I don't know.
B:	I'd eat too.
A:	Let's see what else is on television.
A:	Oh, if you don't have a V C R we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah,
A:	cause, you know, if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile
A:	and then, you know, you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
A:	and then it usually comes on television within two years.  You know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we got,  we've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman
B:	so we usually see like first-rate movies,  right away.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Maybe he drinks
A:	but he never drives a car either, you know,
A:	it's not the same with Johnny Carson.
B:	No,
B:	I think my, seriously my classification of, of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information, and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Without your, and without your permission.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	This to me is, is my invasion of privacy.
A:	Right.
B:	Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or,
B:	but you can always write to, uh, oh I forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail.
B:	That I've done. Because I don't want junk mail anyway,
B:	so I wrote to them when it came on the air,
B:	so I don't get any of that bull,
B:	it works by the way.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	But, uh, the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time, on, uh, you know, answering service anyway, unless I'm home,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I figure I can turn it off one way or the other,
B:	but I think that's the only bottom line thing that I dislike.
B:	Because it does,
B:	other than the U S Census, um,
B:	what was it.
B:	Oh the, the carpet place that called me three times,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called me three times.
B:	I mean one should be sufficient.
A:	That's right.
B:	But, if people don't use the telephone,
B:	it's like I don't know when the police has their project going
B:	and I don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things.
B:	That's the only way I know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, that's
A:	Well you have to have the telephone,
A:	but you can't, you know,
A:	and, and it's, sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want.
B:	Well see there's no way of knowing,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that's, you know, that's the problem.
B:	Like the product I sell, uh, I sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation.
B:	The only way we'd get to them is by telephone.
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, most of them like it because the company I work for is nationwide, and, uh, reputable
B:	and they know that hey, we're backing it, one hundred percent.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, if we were denied the right to call people up, these people would never be able to get it.
B:	Because your normal companies that offer it, do not offer it in the amounts that we do
B:	and they'd never have it then, at that point.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because we offer it in a very low, you know, quantity.
B:	So I mean, I, I don't know what to do as far as that's concerned.
B:	But it is nerve racking.
B:	I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone,
B:	but at least, as I said, you can always say no thank you
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I gather you get a lot of telephone calls.
A:	Sometimes,
A:	yeah,
A:	some days it just rings off the wall.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
B:	yes.
B:	In other words you own your own home.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	I think that's where they hit most of us.
B:	Like I own my own home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you just know about what time,
B:	like some days I hate staying home because the phone rings all the time,
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	I haven't been able to figure that out.
B:	Something else to do about it.
B:	When they call up and want to say, well tell me this, this, this, this and I'll give you a free something or other, My answer is no thank you, I don't need it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they say, well don't you want to know what's free,
B:	and I no
B:	If I have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that, they're taking something away from me
B:	and I don't like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah
A:	even if, I guess it's for coupons, they, they have a survey they run
A:	and it, I guess it, one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey
A:	but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they ask, you know, they start out
A:	and they ask you even, even to your income level.
A:	I think that's, you know,
A:	whether you buy a T V dinner or not, I don't think it has anything to do with,
A:	Are you ready to start?
B:	Yes.
A:	Okay
B:	Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?
A:	Well, I just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old,
A:	and it doesn't seem like it's that old.
B:	Oh.
A:	Seems like I just bought it.
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	It's an eighty-nine
A:	and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight
A:	so, yeah.
B:	Well, I really, the last car we got was a, was a used car.
B:	I really don't prefer buying a new car.
B:	I like to let somebody else pay for that
A:	I know,
A:	I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.
B:	But, uh mine was a year old,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we bought it for very functional purposes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that was we bought a station wagon.
B:	We wanted an economical car to operate,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.
B:	So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've never been sorry,
A:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	however the need for that kind of car has changed now,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	and, uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	And probably then some
B:	I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.
A:	Sure.
B:	I think that I would like to,
B:	if you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted I would either buy a Nissan Maxima, uh,
A:	Right.
B:	I'm sold on Nissans.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I a or, or foreign cars actually.
B:	Uh,
A:	But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?
B:	Uh,
A:	Is that how you,
A:	I have never,
B:	its reliability.
A:	Its
B:	Its reliability.
B:	And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things,
B:	and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars.
B:	If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.
A:	Isn't that a shame.
B:	But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.
A:	My word isn't that sorry.
A:	That's sorry.
B:	Uh, you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.
A:	My word.
B:	And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.
A:	Oh, mercy.
B:	So,
A:	You,
B:	and that was just trying to hold us,
B:	getting out of that was a used car.
A:	Huh.
B:	And it was an older car,
A:	Huh.
B:	but, you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales.
A:	Huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's just, it just was not
B:	and you get stung a time or two,
A:	Sure.
B:	and you say, no thanks.
A:	No thanks.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, uh, reports
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly,
B:	and he gave me four choices of cars to buy
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	An Escort definitely was not among them.
B:	In fact, there wasn't an American car in there.
A:	Wow.
B:	Uh, the Nissan came
B:	and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it served our needs.
B:	Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for.
B:	And that, and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac.
B:	I really would.
B:	It's not necessarily prestige,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's comfort.
B:	Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car.
B:	Uh,
A:	Who makes that car?
B:	Nissan.
A:	I mean but where are they, where are they,
A:	what, what is their location,
A:	is it, uh, Asian
A:	or is it European
A:	or who,
B:	No.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	Nissan is Japanese.
A:	Oh, it is Japanese.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh,
A:	Okay,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I didn't know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay
B:	I mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess so
A:	that's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Now what about you,
B:	if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get
A:	If, if, if I had the car I wanted.
B:	and why?
A:	Gee.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	See there,
A:	But I, I don't know the performance of it.
A:	That's a, Ford product,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, I would get hung up by my boot straps if I if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Really was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I, I really have not seen,
B:	now a lot of the American cars actually are, are, parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa.
A:	Can I put you on hold for one minute?
B:	Of course.
A:	Thank you.
A:	Well, that was one minute.
A:	They hung up.
B:	Okay
B:	Uh, at any rate do you have color preferences
B:	or what would be the features that you would be looking for?
A:	Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. Um, and the luxuries of a large car.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, now color preferences,
A:	I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	We like the stuff that glitters
A:	Yeah.
B:	Good.
B:	There's nothing wrong with that.
B:	Actually I think probably if I were going to get if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be,  I would prefer white. Because, simply because it's more visible at night.
A:	Right,
A:	well, practical
A:	yes
A:	that's,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right
A:	and it's cooler I believe, too, when you're driving in,
B:	And,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now the interior,
B:	okay,
B:	I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But if I had the little red C R X , I guess the interior would have to be black leather
B:	and I'd have to live with that.
B:	And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
A:	Um, can you, uh, hang on again
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Thanks
A:	I've got the phones for lunch hour.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
A:	Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.
B:	That's okay.
A:	Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music,
A:	or do, is it talk shows.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	no.
B:	I generally would uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, I listen to K C B I a lot
B:	but I will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time, I want some real good classical music.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I love classical music,
B:	and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the, all the characteristics of the instruments.
A:	All the,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's true.
B:	So I do love classical music
B:	or it or, or, uh, contemporary classical.
A:	Do you listen Do you listen to W R R?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	Sure do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to, more than anything else.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I do like them.
B:	And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car.
B:	That would be,  something that I would really like.
A:	Those are nice, aren't they?
A:	Yes,
A:	those are nice.
B:	Those compact discs,  really are good for cars because they don't melt,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they don't warp.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, uh, rollers or anything.
B:	It seems like a really good answer to portable music, that you can choose.
A:	Huh.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	I, I do a fair amount of cooking.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and I love having guests to dinner.
A:	I probably do that about once a month.
A:	And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you know,
A:	it, it, I like to prepare chicken, that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How about you?
B:	Yeah,
B:	those are things I like the most.
B:	I like fish and chicken the most.
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.
A:	Uh.
B:	Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it.
B:	And then I just, uh, you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I made scallops the other night,
A:	that was unusual,
A:	and, uh, basically, uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave
A:	and you sprinkled, uh, you swished around a little melted butter and do, uh, oh I do not know, microwaved them for about nine minutes.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	four and a half to five minutes
A:	and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,
A:	very simple, but very nice.
A:	So, if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good.
B:	Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
A:	Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, my husband liked it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, no
A:	unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, uh, fish items.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	But, you know, I, I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
A:	Uh, one of the things I love to do, eat out.
A:	How about you?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Do you have any particular places you like going?
B:	Oh, there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I like that,
B:	it's just, it's just home cooking.
A:	Yes.
A:	I have been there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it's kind of, kind of like Black Eye Pea,
A:	but I do not think it's a chain.
B:	Right,
B:	exactly,
B:	uh-huh,
B:	and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, I do not really like, uh, you know, uh, uh, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,
B:	or I do not like greasy places.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I do not feel like they are very healthy,
A:	and I always, feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, go to them.
B:	Right,
B:	and I, and I got, uh, chicken marinara the last two times.
A:	Oh, how was it?
B:	It was, uh, it was great.
A:	Um.
B:	Because that's, that's what I like,
B:	I do not like it, you know. I just like a baked, you know, a piece of chicken
B:	and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I tend to, uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, uh, I like experimenting on, on food
A:	and sometimes I go for fairly exotic things.
A:	And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe
A:	and it was just a total bust.
A:	I was, sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way back.
B:	He tried to make bagels one time.
A:	Oh my that's ambitious.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh, we took some
B:	and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,
B:	and we took some and gave it to the dogs,
B:	and the dog never, you know, he treated it like a milk bone
B:	and he never did finish it.
A:	Um.
B:	He just barely made a dent in it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, and, uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's, uh, supposed to be candy.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,
B:	it was, you know. It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, uh, into a kind of a candy stick,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, uh.
A:	Huh, see I am not,
A:	that's interesting.
A:	One of the things I do not make is dessert.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.
A:	And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, everything else was fine,
A:	but that was a fiasco.
B:	Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.
B:	Or,
A:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	just about.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,
A:	so I can live without, live without dessert for the most part.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Use about half the sugar,
B:	or make everything diet.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, do you cook for yourself
A:	or do you cook for others?
B:	Mostly, I just cook for myself.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	It's easy,
B:	that's for sure.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,
A:	if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I always put cheese on them.
A:	And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,
B:	it's mostly starch.
B:	So, it fills you up
B:	and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I I did not say it was nourishing,
A:	but it was satisfying.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it really is.
A:	And,
B:	Then you have to make a salad
B:	or,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
A:	but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,
A:	so I ate very simply.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.
A:	I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.
B:	Right.
A:	Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Except you get to taste the product instead .
A:	Yes,
A:	and have an explosion.
B:	Fill them up
B:	or blow up.
A:	Sometimes it blows up anyway.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.
A:	And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe
A:	and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,
A:	and it does turn to toffee inside the can.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.
A:	It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.
A:	And, and the boy friend thought,
A:	it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,
A:	so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang
A:	and there he was.
A:	And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Did you let the can cool off?
A:	Uh, I really do not remember,
A:	that was about ten years ago,
A:	I just remember how embarrassing it was.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before
A:	and I never had that problem,
A:	just that one time.
B:	Huh. Yeah.
A:	And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,
A:	he was kind of pushy too.
A:	Acted like, he came from San Francisco
A:	and he had a very sophisticated taste.
A:	I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him
A:	and, and well, it was a memorable evening anyway.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, as far as,
A:	I, I do enjoy cooking
A:	so, I was awfully glad I was given this,
A:	Are you ready?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She didn't announce that to you?
B:	Oh, I didn't, I didn't quite hear all of it.
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	That's fine.
A:	Um, I think, uh, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant
B:	Right
A:	So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
B:	Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
A:	Not for the price?
B:	Well, a little bit for the price,
A:	Okay.
B:	but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places I've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The
A:	Really?
A:	Okay.
B:	Really.
B:	Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up
B:	and I was like, I'm not eating in there
B:	Are you nuts?
B:	And, uh, we went in
B:	and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
A:	My word,
A:	it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	I'm serious.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to Atchafalaya.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	that's not right.
B:	That's not right.
B:	That's not right.
A:	Okay.
B:	someone in the What's the name of that restaurant?
B:	in the background Where at? .
B:	someone in the background The Hari Krishna.
B:	in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's .
B:	Kalachandji's.
B:	It's all vegetarian,
B:	and it, it was just fabulous.
B:	I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
A:	Wow.
A:	And where was that at, near your,
B:	Um, Kalachandji's.
B:	It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
A:	Where,
A:	is it in Dallas?
B:	Yes.
A:	Is it in the phone book?
B:	Uh, I think so.
B:	It should be.
A:	Do you know how to spell it?
B:	Uh, it starts with a K.
A:	Okay.
B:	So K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
A:	Kalli , K A L L I?
A:	Okay.
B:	That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it.
B:	I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	section,
A:	yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
A:	What about fast foods?
A:	Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
B:	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
A:	You do, like Arby's?
A:	See I don't like Arby's.
B:	Oh, really?
B:	Why?
A:	No,
A:	because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.
A:	They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver
A:	and they, they form it,
A:	and they make it look like roast beef,
A:	and I said, no,
A:	thank you.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no,
B:	no.
B:	Someone has been lying to you.
B:	What they use is roast beef.
A:	Well, that's not what I heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
B:	That's what,
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm surprised.
B:	My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
B:	Well, that's happened before.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we like good uh, we're, we like Mexican food.
A:	Okay.
B:	And stuff like that.
B:	And so, um,
A:	How about the health food, uh, restaurants? Well, like this one
A:	but it's probably not advertised as such, is it?
A:	Or,
B:	A health food?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Health food, uh, restaurants that,
B:	Like, like,
B:	name one
A:	Well well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
B:	I'm not sure what you're talking about.
A:	But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
A:	and they list them.
A:	Now there's one restaurant that does that
A:	and it's called Rodolfo's
A:	over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.
B:	Huh.
A:	And they have very good food over there.
B:	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that
B:	so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	They do list, um, you know, list the fat,
B:	It would be good I think,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, I don't know how expensive they are.
B:	It sounds like that it would probably,
A:	Well, it was pretty reasonable.
A:	I, it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay,
A:	which is kind of high for lunch I guess.
B:	For one person?
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	A bit
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but, um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, uh, um, men waiters.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
A:	Well, if you're looking for a nice,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Maybe, maybe that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I could see that, then maybe.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
A:	Because they're,
A:	Well, they have lunch specials that
A:	you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Probably that's true.
B:	But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
A:	Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast
A:	and it was excellent.
A:	It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast
A:	and it was
B:	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
A:	Oh, it was,
B:	That's one of my husband's pet peeves.
B:	He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
A:	Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north
A:	and that was a no no.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	And I haven't gotten over that from the north.
B:	Oh, catfish is wonderful.
A:	I know they say that, that is,
B:	Oh, really.
A:	but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
B:	Really.
A:	and so I kind of stay
B:	Why?
A:	Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
B:	Oh.
B:	Huh.
A:	and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
B:	That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it
A:	I,
A:	Well, yeah.
A:	So I am,
A:	and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
B:	That's true.
A:	So I'm, I, you know, I,
B:	Oh, on one hand I see that
B:	and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Corrode.
A:	Huh.
B:	So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then they take these things that will rust
B:	and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
A:	Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
B:	Oh.
B:	And then they wouldn't think.
B:	They were floating around
B:	so they shot holes in them to sink them.
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	And this is before I was born.
A:	Wow.
B:	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
A:	Sure.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
A:	That's right.
A:	Everything we eat.
A:	Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it
B:	You can't get away from it
B:	so I think, To some point,
A:	Yeah.
B:	yeah,
B:	you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know,
B:	this is not in my control.
A:	Well, you know,
B:	So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death
B:	or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.
A:	Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
A:	Do you use credit cards a good bit?
B:	I do,
B:	and I wish I didn't
A:	Uh.
B:	Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know  the cash with me all the time,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,
B:	and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA.
A:	Okay.
A:	Absolutely.
A:	Right.
B:	And so that's why I went ahead and got one.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was a mistake
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't use them very often.
A:	Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,
A:	and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,
B:	Yeah.
A:	just enough to keep them active.
A:	My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,
B:	Yeah.
A:	or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.
B:	That's right.
A:	Uh, and it saves a lot time.
A:	And that's what I was using it for.
A:	However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,
A:	you must have the money to do this with,
A:	and you do not have any other options
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I charged all three of those cards up,
A:	and right now I am paying and praying.
B:	I know how that goes
A:	But, uh,
B:	and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we had no way around it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and so like you were paying for it,
B:	but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.
A:	Well, I never did, Right.
A:	I never did use it for an advance.
A:	Most of my charges were, uh, medications.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	Didn't have cash for the medications
A:	or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, uh, uh,
A:	different labs will use those charge accounts for,
B:	What,
B:	Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?
B:	I've found some doctors that say, you know,
B:	I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,
B:	and so many of them don't anymore.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	So,
A:	Well, I have not,
A:	like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't generally charge.
A:	I say well, I need a checkup in six months,
A:	and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.
B:	Right.
A:	I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,
A:	and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.
B:	Right.
A:	Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.
B:	Oh, it is
A:	It is easy,
A:	and it's very difficult to get out.
A:	I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.
B:	I know.
A:	I say wow,
A:	I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.
A:	Big deal,
A:	I'm saving two percent.
B:	Right.
B:	But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A
B:	and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.
A:	Right.
B:	And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,
B:	and I, I think about young people that think, you know,
B:	there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,
B:	I have my first credit card
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	and it's not just paying back what you've charged,
B:	You know.
A:	it's paying that and half again.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars,
A:	you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.
B:	That's right.
A:	You only get half of that paid for the principal,
A:	so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.
B:	Right.
A:	Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.
B:	Right.
A:	Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.
B:	No,
B:	and that's frightening to me.
A:	Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's frightening, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I work for T I
B:	but he doesn't
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.
B:	I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,
B:	and after ten years he's got two of them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they should pay through next month,
B:	and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.
A:	Oh, right,
A:	right.
B:	And, you know, just in one lump,
B:	because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	or it's like you say,
B:	you pay forever.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And so I'm really looking forward to that.
A:	Well, you either need a big chunk of money
A:	or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.
B:	That's right.
A:	Now, those are very handy
B:	Right.
A:	if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem
B:	Sure,
B:	yeah.
B:	I agree.
A:	because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.
B:	That's right
A:	But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money
B:	I know
B:	and,
A:	And it just irks me.
A:	I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,
A:	and I've got three cards.
A:	I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.
B:	I know.
B:	You're like what am I working for today
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	And that just blows my mind.
A:	I, my house is paid for,
A:	my car is paid for,
A:	I've got some home improvements,
A:	but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.
B:	It's incredible.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,
B:	well, my car is paid for now.
B:	It was wrecked three weeks ago,
B:	but, but you see again the credit cards came in handy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.
A:	That's right.
A:	I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.
B:	And, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I went to a seminar,
A:	they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.
A:	You only use credit cards for investments.
B:	Right.
A:	I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.
B:	It's,
B:	Sure.
B:	That's right.
A:	That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.
A:	I thought God dang, where is his pencil?
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,
B:	don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,
A:	That's right.
B:	and, and so that, that is the smart half.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,
B:	but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,
B:	so we cut that out real quick
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, but I, I do like having them there.
B:	There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or common sense not, not to get yourself in trouble.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, well, Pat, did you vote in the last election?
B:	Most assuredly.
A:	Oh, you did?
B:	Yes ma'am.
B:	I've voted in every major election since I turned twenty-one.
A:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Well, why do you think,  people don't.
B:	Don't always  vote for somebody.
B:	I sometimes vote against somebody
A:	That makes sense too.
B:	I think that a lot of it is, uh,
B:	I know that my late husband was simply indifferent.
B:	He didn't feel like he had any say.
B:	There was too many people, too many other votes.
B:	For example, you know, he'd say, Well, look, you and I see different sides of the fence.
B:	If I go vote you'll cancel my vote.
B:	I said, I sure will.
A:	And,
B:	He said, So, I just won't vote.
B:	I said, Then mine counts, because you could cancel mine too.
A:	Then does,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, I think, that's a lot of people,
A:	just indifferent
A:	I know that I've moved around a lot.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	In the past, um, three years I've had three different addresses.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Each time I change jurisdictions or whatever.
B:	Sure.
A:	So I just haven't,
A:	because, I mean, graduate school or whatever,
A:	so I haven't kept track of it.
A:	I did, when I lived steadily in one community, I always, I voted.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But this past time I didn't.
A:	Well, actually I voted it for the presidential election,
A:	but then I didn't vote uh, I guess, in the two year for, uh, some legislators and things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	Well characteristically, in some, in the local elections typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	If I do not feel very strongly about an issue, then I see no reason to go vote.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah,
A:	and that's probably one reason why I voted in the the last election, but not really this one
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because this one really didn't matter that much.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's probably true.
B:	Well, of course, of course listening to government, the instructors, you'll find out that everything matters,
B:	but then you could go crazy worrying about everything.
A:	Well, you know, they also say that most people vote their local politics, that, that local is far, much more important than, uh, national issues.
B:	Well that's the way you get to national
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood,
A:	Right.
A:	Oh, I definitely think so.
B:	Uh, I know that I have been involved in preparing and in, in, uh, carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even something so simple as getting a street light in between lights on the end of the block.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's completely unnecessary.
B:	In another particular case they were trying to put in a, um, senior citizen's home in, in an area very near our neighborhood,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but if you just cross that major street, the character of the neighborhood changes,
B:	and it's less savory.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay.
B:	And that, I was just very, I felt very strongly about that,
B:	those people simply did not have access to safety, to security
B:	and they were at risk.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it was for elderly people who lived alone,
B:	and they were going to put a cluster of, of houses there for them.
B:	But even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety.
A:	No,
A:	most now,
A:	that's true,
B:	And all it, all it did was to, in my judgment, make them, easier targets
A:	Prepare them to be, victims,
A:	yes.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah,
B:	easier targets,
B:	and so we, we did get a petition together
B:	and we very strongly resisted it,
B:	and it was placed in a actually, it was placed clear, closer to my neighborhood
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it was on the,  right side of the street.
A:	Right side,  of the tracks,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, it, it, I think that they're, they're much more comfortable there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Did they,
B:	Uh, I haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood,
B:	although we have a good crime watch program
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's, it's very serious just across the street.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Did, um, did you think,
A:	I know that Texas's last gubernatorial, uh, election probably brought out a lot of voters.
B:	Well.
A:	Did that, did that seem to,
A:	because that that got national attention, national attention, I guess, having a woman governor running against a man and whatever.
B:	Well.
B:	No,
B:	I don't think it had to do to with woman running against man.
B:	I think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's it
A:	Yeah.
B:	it was a dirty election.
B:	People were calling each other, uh, names and every bit of the trash,
B:	it was a, it was a dirty campaign.
B:	It was a dirty, mud slinging campaign.
A:	Well, you know, what's funny, up here, uh, I live, I see a lot of Virginia news
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I guess, uh, Senator Robb and Governor Wilder are active right here,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the people in Virginia are complaining,
A:	see Robb is married to Lynda Bird Johnson
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the people in Virginia are complaining that he is, he's using Texas politics in Virginia
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're really complaining big time,
A:	because they said that We don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time.
B:	Well,  of course, now, that's not all the time.
A:	So you, you guys were getting  yeah,
B:	We've had some pretty We were having some pretty healthy uh, campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races
A:	you were getting slandered, I think,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I, historically, Texas has had mud and muddier campaigns
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, it's just, I think that eventually, you know, the better people have sensibilities
B:	and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage.
B:	Unfortunately, that's not always the way it should be.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage.
B:	You want to do the one who can do the most good.
A:	Do the most good,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	And, uh,
A:	I guess that's why,
A:	I know that, um, I'm previously from Pennsylvania
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and Dick Thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because, uh, John Heinz, a senator from Pennsylvania, died in an airplane crash
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide Dick Thornburg into, as, into the senate because they don't like the the governor's political appointee, or whatever
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're almost expecting landslide out, uh, turn out, right now for for that election.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	so you So, you see,
B:	that's very negative motivation isn't it
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	isn't that too bad.
B:	We really could use a little positive motivation
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	hey, we think this guy can really make some changes
B:	and we're going to support him.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That was true in a lot of cases in, in a couple of the older sixties campaigns.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh.
A:	What,
A:	in Texas,
A:	was that when, you,
B:	No,
B:	I'm talking about national campaigns.
A:	That's, that's true.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, even when John Kennedy was elected, there were so many strikes against him,
B:	but there were people who believed he could make a difference.
A:	Right.
B:	Now, that's not to say what has transpired or what really was,
B:	I'm saying that's how it was perceived.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	that's, right,
A:	that's perception,
A:	that's true.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Because the, those were big political, that was a big, um, turn out election.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and it was people going to vote for, I think, more than those who voted against.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know, I know that in my own, uh, area of people, whom I knew and how they were going to vote, they didn't go to vote against, uh, a politician as they did a little bit later when Nixon was running.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They went to vote against the less of, lesser of the two evils in certain cases.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they voted their convictions.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I think that also happened with Ronald Reagan.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	He was he was landslided in
B:	You're right.
A:	and people really saw that was,
A:	There we go.
A:	Uh, so, uh, what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary?
B:	Boy, I, I don't know.
B:	That's a, that's a, a tough one.
B:	Uh, uh, and it's, uh, I suppose it's, it's changes as, uh, as my perception changes of, of what, uh, I'm getting gypped on
B:	and
A:	That week,
A:	right.
B:	this week or this month, uh, uh, uh, we're just, uh, going through, uh, uh, well, there's a couple of changes to the, to the, uh, our health plan
B:	and, uh, and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance
B:	but, uh, If I step back I'm not sure I'd, I'd, uh, say that.
A:	Um.
B:	What, what about you?
A:	Well, uh, I, right now I'm in sort of a weird situation.
A:	I'm a graduate student that, uh
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	I don't have that many benefits per se
B:	Yes,
B:	okay,
A:	Uh, sort of get,
B:	But, but, on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for a,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	My wife has a real job
A:	and I can see from her angle.
A:	Uh, uh, I think health insurance is real, real important. I've, I've, I've, I've discovered.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, even in my case it's sort of, they're really, uh, a pain in the neck about it up here
A:	because the university makes me buy a small,
A:	they, they have a mandatory, they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance
B:	Yeah.
A:	they offer insurance to everyone,
A:	but then the basics that are major medical, they, they force you to buy here.
A:	Now I'm covered by my wife's anyway,
A:	but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for, uh, mandatory.
B:	Right,
B:	okay.
A:	So that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for something I'm not getting in that case.
A:	I'd rather that, that went to something else.
B:	And, and, yeah,
B:	and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester, uh, you, you never use because you just use your wife's.
A:	Right.
A:	I mean, uh,
A:	and, and, and it turns out that actually, uh, the benefits they, you know, that, that hundred dollars sort of would, would entitle me to go to the university health services here, you know, and, and use them
A:	and it turns out that I do think they're they're excellent physicians there.
A:	So, through my wife's H M O, we've registered for them as our primary care physicians
A:	so we go there anyway,
A:	so they're, they're, so if they were to bill, which, which I believe they don't,
A:	but if they were to bill the H M O for my business, they could, in, in theory, be getting paid twice for the same thing.
A:	But they're not, thank God.
A:	Uh, but anyway, uh, otherwise, I would imagine, uh, good vacation is, is important, although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job.
A:	I don't, you know,
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	I, it, uh, the, the, that, that's a, a negative about, uh, where, where I am in that, uh, well, I came out of, uh, I worked five years civil service
B:	and there it's, uh, if I remember right, you well, they, they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and, or hours per pay period or something,
B:	but, anyway it works out as I remember basically to, uh,
B:	you start at, at, uh, two and a half weeks or something like that,
B:	and it, at three years, uh, it goes to four weeks I believe,
B:	and I, I'm coming up on, I've been at T I now, uh, uh, coming up on fifteen years
B:	and it, and it just, uh, this year is going to go to four weeks here
B:	so,
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	Uh, uh,
A:	So that's really,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's a, that, that is a, a, a negative, but, uh, but, not, probably not at, probably not a deciding factor,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, I don't, you know, I don't, I know my wife, uh,
A:	I think she gets, you know, about two weeks a year, I guess
B:	Yeah.
A:	but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off.
A:	They, you know, usually let her,
B:	Well, that, that,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's, that's the thing is how, how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, uh, that's the, the, the, uh,
B:	yeah.
B:	That's a, why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the, with the civil service, that you could take, you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
A:	Oh, really.
B:	and, uh, and, but, uh, there wasn't, uh, anything as far as comp time,
B:	so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year, uh, you know, an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing.
A:	Just,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, whereas, uh, here I, uh, things are free enough to, that, uh, the, the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that, isn't that much different,
B:	but, uh, But, uh,
A:	That's, well, that's a that's reasonable, I think.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think the, I think the health insurance,
B:	I think that's, that's going through changes everywhere to, uh,
B:	the, they've, uh, uh, gone through a couple years ago here where they, uh, will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals
B:	and now they're in the process of developing a list of, of, uh, designated doctors, uh,
B:	so that just routine visits, uh, they will compensate much better for, if you go to their designated doctors.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Which, which, uh,
B:	my assumption is that, that will not include my doctor since, uh, he keeps real busy without having to, to, uh,
A:	Weigh all sorts of other things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, I was watching something the other day about that actually on, uh, a news special or something like that
A:	and they were saying how in some sense that, that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes, you know, lowers the cost of everything and all insurance
A:	and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people, you know, don't get to, they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
A:	so,
B:	Well, and, and I think in the, in the, in the much bigger picture than, uh, to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, uh, fixed amount
B:	and, if, if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to, to, uh, uh, give you, you know, give you these rates and make this agreement then, uh, you're not covered by that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and the added costs get passed on to you,
B:	so uh, I'm not, I'm not sure,
A:	Right.
B:	it, my, uh, one of the phrases I use is that, that it's moving towards, uh, private socialized medicine. That, uh, in terms of the negatives of, of always heard in terms of socialized medicine, you have no choice on who you, who you go to for a doctor and things like that, uh, where it's the government that decides,
B:	here it's, it's, uh,
A:	Least off, who decides.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, and, but it, but it's the, the same, the effect is the same as the,
B:	you, you, uh, get left out of the loop more.
B:	I, I, I know that their, uh, idea is that, uh, if, if you have to pay a bigger share, you'll, you'll be more careful about spending the, spending the money and, and helping hold down the costs
A:	Right.
B:	but, uh, I, I, I don't know,
B:	in terms of, in terms of, uh, the health care, I, uh, find that, that, uh, although I've, I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems, but that, that, uh, the cost is not a, a big factor.
B:	I want to, I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better.
A:	Right.
A:	You want to know that, that, that when you pick a doctor, you know, you, you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
B:	and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that's the,
A:	Okay,
A:	do you want to start?
B:	Okay,
B:	uh, I haven't, I don't know that much about the what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury,
B:	but, uh, I think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be unanimous.
A:	Now that, do you, do you agree, that they should all be unanimous?
B:	I don't,
A:	Or even, even in, uh, like they said, you know, lesser, you know, trials, you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still?
B:	I don't know,
B:	I don't know if I feel, I don't feel real strongly about that.
B:	If the, uh,
B:	the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, uh, I didn't think that you really had to have a, a jury
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Unless, I guess, if you request one you can.
B:	But I think,
B:	yeah,
B:	making it unanimous sometimes might, uh, let, the only thing, it might let more people get off.
B:	I don't think it would convict any more people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we have so many people already, you know,
B:	the jails are already overloaded.
A:	Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.
A:	I mean if one is determined that it's, you know, that he feels that he's, you know, going against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.
A:	So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting, you know, just gives in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, if it's,
B:	no,
B:	but they, they, what if they never agree.
B:	Doesn't it just, uh, do they have to go back and do a whole new trial
B:	or,
A:	And they have to stay in until they all agree
B:	Agree
A:	yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I'm not sure if they go, I mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly,
A:	but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either, you know, either he or she can either go free or to jail, either one.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Especially because there's twelve.
B:	The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too,
B:	a lot of times, uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury
B:	and they can sway them that way, too.
A:	That's, that's just it.
A:	I don't understand.
A:	You're supposed to, you know, go in if you have, you know, like if you've never heard of the people before or anything,
A:	but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total, totally impartial to it.
B:	I know.
B:	I don't think, well, I guess you really can't,
B:	but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, but then, again, you know, they, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge
B:	and that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, you know,
B:	they have to, they stay till they retire
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone.
A:	Not only, you know, that they have to stay in there,
A:	but, hey,
A:	how many times have you heard of judges being bought over.
B:	I know.
A:	You know, so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has the presiding, you know, uh, vote.
A:	I think he can be, you know, I, I don't know if it's the way it is in real life,
A:	but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way
A:	and the judge totally finds it obnoxious
A:	and he completely, you know, goes the other way.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what.
B:	I think in some cases they are.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so that's another thing where they have the power,
B:	but maybe juries could be less than twelve people
B:	or would that be more fair or less fair.
B:	Maybe there should be more than twelve people
B:	I don't,
A:	Oh, oh, my God.
A:	If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long they'd be sitting
B:	I know.
B:	I don't know.
A:	I, I think it's just, I don't, I mean, I think it's as fair as it can possibly get,
A:	but I just think it's really you know,
A:	I mean, some cases go on for years, you know.
B:	That's true,
B:	and I've never been on jury duty,
B:	but they have to keep going and going and going. And lose their, not lose their jobs, but not go to work.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I don't know how it could be more fair.
A:	Course, I don't know.
A:	Maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on, on trial before.
B:	It could be,
B:	Really,
B:	I've never seen one in real life either
B:	so I don't have, you know, I don't know that much about it,
B:	but I think, it seems that we have a, a pretty fair system compared to other countries.
B:	I don't know how we could make it more fair.
B:	I really don't.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The unanimous vote is questionable, though.
B:	And, and how, how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because, uh, I don't know if you should really have a jury for a small infraction.
B:	But I'm not sure who gets them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know anything
A:	I know.
A:	I don't know that much about it either.
A:	I just, I don't know.
A:	I, I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, you know, how they can make it more fair for them or not,
A:	but then again, maybe they should be there
A:	so that is fair.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't, I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way.
B:	No,
B:	whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, uh, unique I think, when they started it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, how long do we need to talk?
B:	Do you know?
A:	Oh, I think we can hang up anytime
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh, in, uh,
B:	what do I do now?
B:	Do you know?
B:	Anything,
B:	or just wait for someone else.
A:	No,
A:	I don't
A:	what else to say,
A:	so.
B:	Okay,
B:	well it was nice talking with you.
A:	It was nice talking to you, too.
A:	Bye.
B:	Thanks.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Well, how do you feel about spot spot testing for drugs?
A:	Well, basically I think it would be a good idea myself.
A:	I, uh, I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, you know, to be afraid of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I do think that there has to be some controls, uh,
A:	like, I don't think one test positive should, uh, be, uh, the end of it, you know.
B:	Right.
A:	I, I think they should test more than once.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's  it's refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine.
A:	It,
B:	I mean, all these people that are against it that may, you know, they may not even be on drugs.
B:	They, they call it an invasion of privacy.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And I don't see that.
B:	To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for
A:	That's right.
B:	and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But,
A:	There's so many jobs that, uh, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life
A:	and, you know, and it's, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?
B:	Right.
A:	You know, and I just, um, I, I think  there definitely needs to be some control to it.
B:	Right .
A:	I guess it is possible to have a false positive report.
B:	Yes.
B:	No,
B:	I, I, I agree that, you know, you, there needs to be a, a well thought out, sane approach to, how to administer that program.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Just because you, you, something can get mixed in the mail,
B:	or uh, the chemicals could react incorrectly than, than what you would expect them to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, yeah,
B:	you, you know
A:	Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean, those things do happen.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined  uh, wrongly.
B:	Right,
B:	and, you know, I've
B:	the, the, the company that I work for, uh, has just recently, well, you know, within the last couple of years, instituted for all new hired employees,
B:	they submit to a urine test.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	And, they, they say that there's been, you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, you know, it's been in progress
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, I, I fully agree with it
B:	and there's, you know, there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy,
B:	and I, I agree with you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've, you've probably got something you're trying to hide
A:	Yeah
A:	and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do  that, uh, doesn't require the testing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, to me, it's, to me it's not an invasion or privacy.
A:	I think it's people have a right to know if, if, uh, their, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, uh, Yeah.
B:	Or, the quality of their product.
A:	Their work, the work they're doing for their company.
A:	Uh, those things are all affected.
A:	If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first.
A:	It doesn't seem to, uh, bother the quality of work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but eventually it does.
B:	Right,
B:	because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem.
A:	I, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy,
A:	that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know,
A:	and it's destroying a lot of   people's lives
B:	and then   and one of the few that they don't have a cure for
A:	Yeah,
A:	and it's, you know, it's, it's destroying people's lives
A:	and I, I think that person, plus anybody in danger should, should know about it and be aware of it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know.
A:	It's, it's kind of hard to
A:	I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, uh, an invasion of privacy.
A:	Of course, that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today, I guess.
A:	So, I kind of get off on a tangent here.
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh, do you work for, uh, Texas Instruments?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm, I'm down in the, the central,
B:	but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas,
B:	but I'm in a, we live in a town, uh, near a town called Temple. Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway.
A:	Um.
A:	Oh, that's probably why,
A:	my brother did live in Grapevine, Texas.
A:	That's near Dallas.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We're probably about two, two and a half hours south of him.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	It's pretty hot down there probably.
B:	Oh my!
A:	Yeah
B:	It's, actually, we got about two inches of rain in about three hours, yesterday.
A:	Oh, did you really?
B:	And it's   cooled things down somewhat.
A:	Oh, that's great.
B:	It's getting more humid now,
B:	but,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, we need rain real bad up here.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	It's, uh, everything's really getting dry.
A:	It's, uh,
B:	Yeah
B:	It's been about three weeks since we've had any.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's kind of at a dangerous level here.
A:	People hauling water,
A:	and, uh it's getting real bad.
B:	Um.
B:	Wow.
A:	So.
B:	How about that?
A:	So.
B:	Well, I hope you do get some rain up there.
A:	Um So do I
B:	I
A:	Uh, I can't think of anything else, uh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I guess being in agreement  kind of tends to limit the conversation  you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I can understand
A:	I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them, I can see them objecting. You know?
A:	there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with .
B:	One of the things I found interesting,
B:	it, it's funny that you mentioned that,
B:	T I is pretty much a worldwide company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um. Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they don't have to submit to drug testing like, like they do here in the States and some places abroad.
A:	Oh, I'll be darn.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I thought that was kind of interesting too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	the different cultures and that  too, uh
B:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, uh, uh, from a quality standpoint, that's not, I mean, just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way.
A:	No,
A:	no.
A:	I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way.
A:	I, I can't think that would make any difference  whether it was legal or not,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	it, it would still have to affect you the same way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, like if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean if, if, you know, that, that's the trade off.
A:	Oh yeah.
A:	You can't you go by their laws.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there.
A:	That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules
B:	Huh
A:	and, uh some of the countries are very much against drugs
B:	Right.
A:	and you use them, you pay for it
B:	Usually with you life in some places.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot of them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Where, where  is it they lose the, if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger?
B:	That's right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	from the Middle East.
A:	Is that where it is?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Iraq, Iran, in that area.
A:	I thought, wow
B:	Yeah
A:	You know, that's quite a deterrent
B:	Well, in Saudi Arabia, you know, using, uh, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's pretty strict over there
A:	Yeah.
A:	So I guess, you know, we, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how   great out country really is.
B:	Well, people tend to  take the first amendment out of context. Which, which means you know, I could do anything I want to
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you can't stop me,
B:	and you know
A:	They, they abuse it is what they do.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, that's,
A:	So,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I'm, I'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy,
A:	Okay,
A:	let's talk about schooling.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, what, what contacts do you have with the public school
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I have a boy
A:	and he just went into middle school,
A:	and I have a girl,
A:	and she's in, uh, grade school,
A:	and then I have a little boy who goes to, uh,
A:	they have something just before kindergarten,
A:	and it's called Early Childhood,
A:	and I have a young a young boy in that.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I, I have a lot of children in, in the school system down here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, I think we have excellent teachers here.
A:	I am really, uh,
A:	like the like the way the teachers work with the students.
A:	Uh, I've not been so, um, happy with the schools themselves, I guess.
A:	Like, my, last year, my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was just packed.
A:	I mean, it was a, a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it was just a real problem.
A:	Uh, so we had to do a bond issue and, and, um, vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do, or to, uh, work on the, work for another school to be built, which is a good idea,
A:	but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, um, I think one thing is that would,
A:	maybe we don't have enough schools,
A:	and secondly, when we have enough schools, sometimes we can't get the, the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers.
B:	Well, I think that's, I think that's, uh, true.
B:	I, I've got a little different, uh, contact,
B:	but I've, I've got a, one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a, a sophomore this year
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	Uh, but, in general, I, I think the, the, you know, one of the reasons that we, we, uh, the, chose to live in Richardson when we, when we came here was the, was the schools,
B:	and I think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the, uh, things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent that
A:	We see through the, out the country.
B:	uh, right,
B:	right.
B:	And I think, I think part of that is that, is the, the, uh, a big part of that is just the demographics,
B:	the population in those schools are, are, typically, uh, people that very much value the education and support the, the school systems
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that's right.
B:	and, and, uh, although there's still some, still some problems,
B:	but, uh, I, you know, I, when I was, when I was going to school,
B:	I grew up in Iowa,
B:	and, and, in my family, school was certainly valued,
B:	but if there was ever any sort of a, uh, if if I was ever in trouble in school, I was also in trouble at home even more so,
A:	Yeah
B:	and I think that part of it is, is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, uh the culture that doesn't, doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, uh what the schools are, are trying to do.
A:	The home,
A:	yeah.
A:	I think that's right.
A:	It is so hard with a family system, um, either divorced or, or just one parent or just
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a, a hard situation for the children, uh, to, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school, um
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think what you said is, is really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, um, what about your wife,
A:	is she, she happy at school
A:	or .
B:	Well, uh, she, she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher.
A:	I bet she does.
B:	She has, she has two half day classes.
B:	So she has, uh, you know, on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	and uh, uh, but her, her background is in, is in, uh, child development, and and, uh, so forth,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so kindergarten is as high as she, as she wants to teach,
B:	and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that, that, that's the jobs that are available and that, the schedule matches, uh, you know, with our kids and things like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Right.
B:	So, yeah,
B:	uh, and, but, uh, the ...
B:	So, the the question had something to do with usage of personal computers, um.
A:	Yes,
A:	we are, we are talking about computers this morning.
B:	Um, I'm a firm believer in, in having lots of them.
B:	I'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me.
A:	You have, you have four machines around you,
A:	boy, well, you've, uh, you've got me beat.
A:	I have a, a Zenith here
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and at home I have a Commodore and a Zenith,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and my wife has an A T and T Twelve Hundred, I believe it is.
B:	Good grief.
B:	What do you do with all those?
A:	Well, actually on my Commodore I mainly study lottery numbers, would you believe.
A:	I have written some, uh, programs in Basic whereby I can select any number of, uh, drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	I have another program in which I can look at the cyclical, uh, appearance of these numbers to see if there's anything that's consistent on that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have another number that allows me, another program that allows me to add all the numbers I want,
A:	and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so this is what I do most of the time, uh,
B:	That's what you do on your, at least one of your machines
A:	On my Commodore
B:	on your Commodore.
A:	on my Commodore,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	And of course I have, uh, word processors,
A:	and I write all my letters
B:	Yeah.
A:	it's wonderful, uh,
A:	my, uh, thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I get them all down,
B:	Yes.
A:	and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake, who cares,
A:	you can go back and, uh, correct it very easily
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	so that makes it very, very nice.
A:	I get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very, very readily.
A:	So how about you, Charles?
B:	Well, I, um, I do an awful lot of preparation of documents, um, uh,
B:	and I use word processors and, and fancier programs, I mean you know, graphics programs and simply make all of our slides,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	some of them I do on a Sun,
B:	some I do on an X T
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	now maybe we don't call these personal computers, um,
B:	I started out with, you know, an I B M P C back in the, you know, about a year after they came out
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, you know.
A:	So, where, may I ask where you work, sir?
B:	I work for the government in Washington.
A:	I know you work for the government,
A:	I just wondering are you an ,
A:	or what, what, what section of it,
B:	Of, in, in, in an obscure part of the defense department.
A:	Oh, uh-huh,
A:	because, see, that's my type of work, too.
A:	I work at the Applied Research Lab here, here on campus,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, my, my field is underwater acoustics
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into, uh, studying how, uh, things vary in the water, you know and, uh, taking advantage of them, and so forth,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so it's a very nice, very nice field,
A:	and I, I am retiring at the end of this month. End of December, excuse me.
B:	Are, are, are you, are you also a professor,
B:	or, or do you just research.
A:	Yes.
A:	I'm a, I'm an associate professor,
A:	but my, I, I'm a full time researcher
B:	Yes.
A:	and it's, uh, been a very, very interesting career, believe me.
B:	I can believe.
B:	What are you going to, what are you going to do when you stop, I mean, take all your machines with you, or,
A:	Well, uh, the ones here in the laboratory obviously I'm, they're going to stay,
A:	but I have similar machines at home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I would consider doing some more consulting when I get home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I have a very, very busy extra life anyway.
A:	I'm also a musician,
A:	and I play in several symphony orchestras
B:	Yes.
A:	and, uh, I run a concert band,
A:	and so I have a lot of external, uh, interests
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	but I do want to get very deeply, much more deeply into computer work, because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There's no doubt about it,
A:	because it is really taking over,
A:	and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers, because, uh, it's so much involved
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than I am, because, uh, I don't get to use it in my daily work as much as I would like to.
A:	Here again let's say I'm starting to getting ready, in preparation for retirement
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, so basically what I'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things.
A:	For many, many years I had a full size acoustics, uh, study laboratory where I could take recordings and, and, uh, perform experiments with them and so forth,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so that's gone now,
A:	and so I'm sort of out of business.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, as I say, I worked with
A:	fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow I worked with for many, many years
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he is now retired.
A:	So it's been an interesting life,
A:	and computers have come in towards the latter end of that.
A:	I wish we had had computers in the very beginning.
A:	It would have been,
A:	Seem to have the topic already on top of tip of your tongue there
A:	so why don't you go ahead and start.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Isn't the, uh, the subject auto repair, for tonight?
A:	Yes, sir.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's great.
B:	The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car
B:	and, that's something I like to do and, uh, something I, something I can do with now the sophisticated auto, cars we have today with all the computers and everything.
A:	Okay.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly.
B:	It's, uh, and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car,
B:	but I do like to get out and tinker with a car
B:	and it's something I can do still.
B:	Do you enjoy working with your car?
A:	I sure do.
A:	I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't even remember what it is.
A:	I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex, where we are not allowed to, work on our vehicle.
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	We can't even wash our vehicle,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, that's too bad.
A:	Uh, but the last thing I can remember doing
A:	I had a sixty-six Mustang,
B:	Oh.
A:	and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	And, uh, you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still,
A:	and, uh, I didn't tinker too much with the engine.
A:	It was, it was in pretty good shape,
A:	but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, uh,
A:	but it was fun.
A:	It was taking the whole thing, you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering new carpeting and, uh,
B:	And did you install all that yourself?
A:	Right.
B:	Well, that was, I bet that was a lot of fun.
A:	And,
A:	It, it was.
A:	I, my wife enjoyed, uh, she, you know, helped out a little.
A:	We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels. And painted, those and,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow.
B:	Do you still have the car?
A:	No,
A:	I sold it.
B:	Well, that's too bad.
B:	A sixty-seven uh, Mustang is about the, uh, top, top year for the Mustang car.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was fun though.
A:	It was fun.
A:	I, I really enjoyed it,
A:	and I was surprised at, at, uh, the availability of parts yet.
B:	Yes.
A:	You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, uh, you pay a premium
A:	but you just don't get them.
A:	I, I didn't.
A:	I went ahead and got, you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made,
A:	Canada.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, prefabs and all that stuff
A:	but,
B:	Well, you know, that's, that's fine.
B:	I, I don't think that there would be, uh, you know, a, a quality difference.
B:	I don't know.
B:	You wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you?
A:	Well, actually there was.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns, uh, exactly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so like the, the glove box was just a little, little wider, little harder to fit in,
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	and the carpeting, uh, stretched a little too far.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I had to cut some of the sides down.
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	But just, just little things.
A:	You know, one of the screws on, on the door uh, window regulators
A:	you could get three of the, three of the four to lineup.
A:	The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.
B:	Oh, I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?
A:	You know,
A:	Oh, it was
A:	but, the end result is after you put your, your panels on, nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your, your window regulator anyway
A:	and, it, it runs. It works just the same,
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's true.
B:	Well, you know, that, that is something I really enjoy doing. Um, working on our car too,
B:	the, uh, I just changed my oil, oil tonight
B:	but, uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes
B:	and, uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car.
B:	And, uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on those kind of things.
A:	Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem
A:	but I, I honestly don't have the tools for the drum.
A:	I know you got, uh, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Spoons and,
B:	Yes,
B:	you do
A:	Uh, my dad has got all that
A:	and, and I, I helped him when I was growing up,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I don't have that stuff now,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take them in.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	And, you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too
B:	because, um, I was helping my neighbor out
B:	and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
B:	and I don't have, of course, the equipment to do that,
A:	Sure.
B:	so he took it into a shop and had it uh, resurfaced and, and fixed that way.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	it is true, uh, you know,
B:	I did have a sixty-four Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it, because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff, that's in there now.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll tell you what.
A:	The other, the nicest thing about them is, uh, everything was standard.
A:	You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Boy, I tell you.
B:	And you know,
A:	Uh, what do you think are the major social changes?
B:	Well,
A:	What age, uh, if you don't mind me asking.
B:	Well, I'm, I'm, uh, thirty-one.
A:	Oh, well, you're, you're young.
A:	I'm in my early fifties
B:	Yeah,
B:	right
A:	so you should take my word
A:	you're young
B:	Oh, I, you know, I've seen a social change,
B:	yeah.
B:	It's definitely,
B:	for sure,
B:	and it's, uh, uh, and besides that, I came from California where social change is like, you know,
A:	Every day?
B:	Yeah.
B:	I mean every second.
B:	You know, social change in California means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I can believe that
B:	And, uh, when I started work there in, it started, you know, actually going to work in eighty-two,
B:	I guess that's when it was.
B:	Between eighty-two and eighty-five, uh, it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work,
B:	and then it became, you know, an hour and a half, to, you know, some days, two hours to get to work.
B:	That's social change.
A:	That's, that's social change.
A:	Well, what do you think is, is the major social change?
B:	Oh,
A:	Right now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's a, that's a tricky one.
B:	I'll let you go first.
A:	Okay.
A:	I think probably the big major change is the role of women.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think, one, the women, uh, in the work force.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think the fact that they're becoming, uh, more, uh, how do I want to say, not necessarily politically inclined,
A:	but they're more apt to be in political offices now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think, you know, we've made great strides in that respect.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that it, thirty years ago, when, uh, I was newly married, family was very, very important.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit.
A:	And I think now it's revolving back full circle.
A:	I think the family unit is becoming much more important than it was.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I think it's, that's probably for two reasons.
B:	Uh, you know, the number one is, women wanted to get out of the house.
B:	And the second reason was, is everything costs so much more that if you don't have, you know, equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much
A:	That's true,
A:	that's true
A:	Well, I know that economically, uh, a wife almost has to work anymore.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And yet, I'm also noticing, uh, in the areas that I'm working and stuff, more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn't.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, you know, they wanted children,
A:	but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I see, I am seeing women now wanting to stay home more, at least until the children are up to, you know, school age.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I find that very interesting that, that it's sort of reverting back.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I've, I've, I've found that, too, you know, where the wife is married and, and,
B:	I mean, not, not married,
B:	sorry,
B:	wrong word.
B:	Where the wife has gone to school, you know and gotten a degree, spent five years out in the work force, found, you know, the, the, their husband, either at college, or whatever,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but still, you know, after five years, it's like, first kid
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and then they're out of the work force for another ten years.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, I think most of those people are still out
A:	Probably.
B:	I think that generation, they're all at home right now
B:	and, and we won't see them back for another two or three years.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I'm, very rarely do I meet anybody whose children are, are, you know, past that age when they've been away for a few years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, it's kind of different.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	It, uh, I, I note that I had, taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have these, the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care, get them through their homework, get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, that's tough.
B:	I, uh,
A:	I don't envy these young parents
B:	I'm an assistant Scout Master
B:	and that's, that's it's like, uh,
B:	yeah,
B:	parents, uh, even rarely see their kids for weekends, which is, you know, kind of rough, too.
A:	That's true.
A:	That's true.
B:	Especially now.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and I'm finding, you know, running into these, uh, women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine, forty, I'm thinking at the age of fifty-two, you're crazy
B:	Yeah.
A:	You're going to be doing your worst running around when you're fifty
A:	And you're absolutely nuts
B:	I, I know two women that, that, uh,
B:	let's see,
B:	one of them's forty-nine
B:	and the other one, well, the other one, I don't know what her age is,
B:	but I know she is, she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there.
B:	And, uh, boy, I'll tell you,
B:	these are the, the go-gettingest, happiest people I've ever met.
B:	You know, because,
A:	Well, you can be go getting,
A:	but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown
B:	I'm thirty,
B:	I'm getting gray hairs already
A:	I just know it, it would absolutely exhaust me.
A:	Maybe it's because it's my grandchildren
A:	and it's not my children.
B:	Um.
A:	Maybe that's,
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, let me see, I've got two children.
A:	One is, uh,
A:	both preschoolers,
A:	one is two
A:	and one is, uh, four.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, and, uh, this is my first year off,
A:	and I've always worked, uh, from the time that they were little
A:	and so I decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which I hadn't been doing.
B:	Well, I think that's wonderful.
A:	So,
B:	My children are in college.
A:	Oh.
B:	But I teach school
B:	and I teach, uh, middle school age children.
A:	Oh.
B:	And so I see a lot of, uh, variation in what happens when kids are at home.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, I have taught school ever since my children were little.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's
B:	and your holidays are, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So teaching, I think is a, a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids.
A:	Well, that's what I was doing before,
A:	I was teaching for Richardson School District.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little.
B:	Right.
A:	And it's really hard.
B:	Well, with them being as young.
B:	It was much, much harder when mine were young.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, uh, college work and his Master's degree and so forth,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a job.
A:	That's right,
A:	that's right.
A:	And that's what was kind of what, where we were, you know,
A:	we, I really didn't have to work,
A:	but I felt like I really wanted to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I felt, I also felt like, boy, I was sure missing a lot
A:	and they were growing so fast
A:	and you know, it's like, do I really need to work, you know?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, and it, that choice was there,
A:	I really didn't have to
A:	and, you know so I did have that advantage there,
A:	but it's different staying home too, you know.
B:	Yes,
B:	it certainly is.
B:	We,
A:	It's an adjustment to make, also.
B:	Well, I think that, uh, we need to spend more family time together with, with children today.
B:	Uh, we made a point to spend a lot of quality time
B:	and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in, you know, like, uh, through scouting or you know, anything like that
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	we participated.
B:	And, uh, we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now.
A:	Wow, that's great.
B:	When,
B:	yeah,
B:	when, uh, the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together,
B:	but we did always have breakfast together.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, we, we had supper together as much as possible,
B:	but when it wasn't feasible, you know, we kind of kept a master calendar and when it wasn't feasible, well, that was understandable,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but uh, we've always tried to spend time to talk and, uh, have some time, together time
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we sat around the table,
B:	we didn't sit in front of a T V or that kind of thing.
A:	Wow, that's great.
B:	So I think that's been important, because we do have a close family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and even though the kids are basically, uh, grown, uh, they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh, have spoken before of, they want that kind of, you know, situation for them when, you know, and their children when they marry and have children.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	kind of goes on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They do what they see, you know.
B:	That's right.
B:	They model
B:	and, with the dysfunctional families today, I'm sure, with a, as a schoolteacher also, you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the, between, uh, oh, second families, uh, one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	and then you see them magnified in the children.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Plus, you teach middle school,
A:	so I'm sure that,
B:	Oh, boy,
B:	yes.
A:	You are really, you really,
A:	boy, oh, boy.
A:	I taught early childhood
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I had the little ones.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, you know, I saw it there, too,
A:	and you, you know, you just oh, it's, it's, kind of an eye-opener.
B:	It is.
A:	So,
B:	It is.
B:	And I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think we make a point to do that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think you're right.
B:	Because we see we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think if we weren't so interested in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I think, uh, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools,
B:	it's what's happening in the families.
A:	I agree,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, they expect us to, you know, have, create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you get to a point where it's completely impossible.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I agree.
A:	I, I know exactly what you're saying
B:	And you just get more and more frustrated
B:	and yet, you feel for the, the kids.
B:	You do the best you can
B:	but,
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, what do you consider an invasion of privacy?
B:	Uh, I was just now told that's what the topic was
B:	and, uh, I guess invasion of privacy, uh, to me, for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards for example.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, uh, ran a series of, uh, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers. And use it
A:	It's very easy.
B:	and I was quite surprised at that.
B:	I guess I can consider myself fortunate that, uh, it never happened to me.
A:	Now, I've never, I've never had that happen to me either.
B:	I don't know what I'd really do if it did.
A:	What do you think about places,
A:	like I was in Michael's the other night and charged something,
A:	and they asked for my home phone even though, you know, the charge had been approved.
A:	What do you think of that?
B:	Uh,
A:	Does it bother you to give it?
B:	No,
B:	not really because I'm listed in the phone book.
B:	If I was the type of individual that, uh, had an unlisted number, I, I think I would be hesitant to give it.
A:	You know that they, they now have a, uh, I believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets.
B:	One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, uh, they did a lot of things with your Social Security number.
A:	Security number,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license.
A:	Oh.
B:	And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number,
B:	so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks.
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
B:	And I was really, you know, unhappy about that situation.
B:	I think that was an invasion of privacy.
A:	Privacy,
A:	yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I can see, you know, where that was.
A:	I, I don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, you know, when I have to cash a check.
A:	I don't see any need for it when I'm charging something,
A:	but I, neither am I a person that has the guts to say, no,
A:	I'm not going to give it to you, either
B:	Right.
A:	You know, and, uh,
B:	One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, uh, mail lists and things like that.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
B:	You know, uh, recently we, uh, I purchased some magazines, U S NEWS and FORBES magazine.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And every since that day, I have been inundated with, you know, uh, subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, uh, this news letter, this investment letter, uh, even to the point of people calling me at home.
B:	And prior to me ordering these magazines, I never got those kind of calls.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	And,
A:	I discovered with, uh, charge cards, uh, I feel like that I don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the, uh, uh, credit report bureau sells it,
A:	but I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, you know.
B:	From some, some list,
B:	yeah.
A:	From some list, you know, that knows that I have a, say a charge account at, at Neiman's or something
A:	because then I'll get catalogs that, you know, are within that range that I would never order from ordinarily,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, you know, and I get, I get tired of that.
A:	I, because I look at all that junk mail,
A:	and I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up you know, all their time to sort
B:	All their time.
A:	and they're not even paying full postage.
B:	Sure.
A:	You know, and if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service.
B:	I think the general public would be, you know, uh, tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, uh, let's say the criminal individuals to, to get access to people's records, uh, their credit cards driver's licenses, checks, things like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure.
A:	Well, you know, let's face it,
A:	computers can be gotten into very easily if you, if you really have the, the know with all, if you're, you know, so inclined to, uh, oh, what do I want to say, have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that. You know, and have a basic knowledge,
B:	Sure.
A:	they're very easy to get into.
A:	To tap into a system.
B:	Seems as though they are,
B:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh, you know,
A:	and, uh, which is scary,
A:	I mean, you know, our lives are on computers.
B:	Unfortunately.
A:	And, uh, and I don't know,
A:	I kind of, I resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something.
A:	Uh,
B:	Fortunately, I haven't, uh, haven't, uh, been inundated with that situation yet.
A:	We are constantly, it seems like.
A:	I don't know why.
A:	You know, either wanting to clean our carpet, sell us storm windows,
A:	Okay, Jerry,
A:	I guess tonight's topic is about recycling.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano.
B:	All right.
A:	Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your garbage can.
A:	Uh, you can put out newspaper,
A:	you can put out glass,
A:	you can put out aluminum cans,
A:	you can put, put out certain types of plastic material
A:	and that is on a roll out effort right now.
A:	Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, uh, participate right now,
A:	but, uh, that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so.
A:	And those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum.
A:	And I think, uh, overall that's an, an excellent opportunity
A:	because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, uh, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today, but for the future also.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I was
A:	How about your community?
B:	My community,
B:	that's cute.
B:	I live in a place called Dye Mound.
A:	Dye Mound?
B:	Or Dye Community.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it's not a city, not incorporated,
B:	my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least,
B:	I can't even see their house
B:	and, uh,
A:	Sounds like a place where I grew up
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness. Literally.
A:	Well, I like it.
B:	And, uh, well, give you an idea,
B:	it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, I mean, to the asphalt,
B:	we're out there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things.
A:	Well, good.
B:	I'm building our house right now
B:	and I'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
A:	Oh.
B:	hopefully, it's not my wife.
A:	Well, let's hope not.
A:	You can be, uh, get in trouble for that.
B:	Well, I thought I'd, you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement type thing.
B:	I don't know if you're familiar with that operation,
B:	but, what you do is you just build up the pressure
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then you go over and release it
B:	and then it just, it just drops, you know.
A:	Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?
B:	Very similar,
B:	yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	okay.
B:	Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack,
B:	but you, it won't go down.
A:	Yes,
A:	until you release it.
B:	Until you pull the pin,
B:	yeah.
A:	All right.
B:	Anyway I have another, uh, recycling method I use.
A:	I think,
A:	Yes.
B:	You know all that junk mail you get?
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	I sure do.
B:	The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Because, uh, well, like I say, we live a way
B:	and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.
A:	Yes.
B:	And I don't like that
A:	No.
B:	so I don't do that.
B:	So I take it
B:	and I send, and I mail it back to them.
A:	Well, great.
A:	That's excellent.
B:	I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
A:	Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail.
A:	That's a great idea.
A:	I hadn't thought about that
A:	and we might be able to incorporate some of that.
A:	One thing,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.
A:	Right.
B:	For instance, uh, I saw a thing on, uh, NOVA, I think it was the other day.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	This guy has designed recyclable materials, I mean recyclable items.
A:	Right.
B:	Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.
A:	Oh.
B:	See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
A:	Yes.
B:	If it's metal, it's all out of metal.
B:	It's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff.
A:	Well, that's a great idea,
A:	that's a great idea.
B:	And, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale.
A:	Products.
A:	Yes.
B:	Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
A:	Yes,
A:	they will.
B:	And,
A:	Exactly.
B:	Well, there is a guy in Dallas,
B:	that's all he does.
A:	Huh.
B:	He collects trash. You know,
B:	and,
A:	Well, that's a full time job.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
A:	Yes,
A:	well, I've found out, too, that, uh, you know, a couple years ago,
A:	we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years,
A:	and at one time we could get a pretty good return, uh, with the Boy Scouts.
A:	We could take and collect the newspaper,
A:	So, are you a news person?
B:	Uh, I really am,
B:	I enjoy, I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can. Although, you know, I'm a full time student
B:	and I work full time, too,
B:	so, or not full time,
B:	but I work quite a bit
B:	and so so I mostly depend on the radio, you know, on the way to work.
A:	Yes.
B:	I like, I like to listen to national public radio, uh, all things considered.
A:	Yes,
A:	great show.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I like to listen to that and catch, you know,
B:	I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	so, so the real, the real current news and, the hard news is, is not, there is not really enough of it there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	that's right,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've had, I've had that frustration, too.
A:	I end up switching stations from time to time.
B:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	you, you you like N P R uh, programming?
A:	Uh, in general.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I watch a lot of C N N uh, and C SPAN.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I, I subscribe to three newspapers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and I, when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have. Of world, world events and national events.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation?
B:	Well we we, we have a, a big newspaper situation.
B:	Uh, because, we used to have two newspapers up until, uh, last Sunday
B:	and a, uh, major, uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down.
B:	They closed shop, and said, well, we can't put any more papers out,
B:	we're done.
A:	Was, was that the, the better paper
A:	or ,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I thought so.
B:	It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned.
B:	It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy. Uh, which I like.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section.
B:	I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening pretty quick.
A:	Yes.
B:	And I feel that the other newspaper, uh,
B:	the the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.
B:	The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, is okay,
B:	but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion
B:	and,
A:	But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES rather, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	that's the problem.
A:	Oh.
B:	But, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know.
A:	Whoever Troy Aikman is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh, you know, you know, you know what I mean
A:	Yeah.
B:	that, there is, uh, local news that, uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh,
A:	I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
B:	yeah
B:	Not something you'll, you'll, uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means. You know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	How, how about you?
B:	Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don't you?
A:	Yes.
A:	A lot of them.
A:	I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and, uh, each of them covers different things in, in in different ways
B:	Right.
A:	and so it's, you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different clearly would have a different perspective on the world.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	Uh, I, I have a question.
B:	Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh,
B:	I, I've kind of gathered lately that, uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business.
B:	Is that, is that a correct assumption?
A:	That, that is certainly true.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, they will, they will have articles,
A:	like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, you know theory of relativity. You know, that started on the front page ran in, into the full, almost full page inside.
B:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, these are feature kind of articles.
B:	Wow.
A:	All the, all the, uh, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities.
B:	Right.
A:	But, but there is some very good other articles uh, you'll find in the, in the JOURNAL.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you find that you're, uh, uh, disappointed or pleased with, uh, uh, the performance of like network coverage of news?
A:	Uh, I wish it were in more depth.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer,
A:	just more facts would be nice.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, C N N has, has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	definitely.
A:	Uh, and they were, you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, but, you know, it's not, it's never quite,
B:	All right.
B:	Uh, exercise huh
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings.
B:	I belong to Presidents.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week
B:	and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, I do, I do a combination of, uh, uh, running and weight training
A:	They set that up for you.
B:	No,
B:	I, uh, actually I just, uh, joined on my own
B:	and I have been thinking about getting with a, uh, one of their counselors just so see what, uh, they might have to offer as far as, uh, alternatives.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I pretty much, uh, worked on my own routine.
A:	And, uh, what kind of running do you do?
B:	They have got the track on the inside.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays
B:	and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then after that, I work out with weights.
A:	Is is just aerobics
A:	or,
B:	Uh, I work out with free weights.
A:	No,
A:	uh, I mean the running.
B:	Oh, uh, yeah.
B:	It is really the, uh, aerobic work out part.
A:	You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less?
B:	Uh, about seven minutes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, uh, out of breath.
B:	Uh, no
B:	I do
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is, that is a pretty good clip
B:	and I am pretty winded by the time I get done.
A:	Oh.
B:	So,
A:	But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to make six or something like that.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I, I, uh, could probably go faster,
B:	but then I would wear myself out
A:	Right.
B:	And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	How about you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I don't run much any more.
A:	I did when I was in school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right now I just lift, uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and I, uh, jump rope a little bit
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that is about it
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, uh,
A:	they are about a third of my body weight.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	So this, uh,
B:	do you just try and keep them, I guess, uh, firm and, uh,
A:	Yeah
A:	and uh, uh, I play the trumpet
A:	and the, uh, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, that is true.
A:	You have to do a whole lot of sit ups
A:	and, uh, and then, uh, I hurt my neck, uh, about three years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, uh, hurting yourself when you play high.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	You have to, you have to do it correctly, you know,
A:	it is like an exercise in itself,
A:	but a lot of people, uh, strain themselves doing it.
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	Uh, so you are in, uh, in part of a band?
A:	Uh, I play at Church.
B:	Oh, I see,
B:	I see
B:	I use to play an instrument when I was in high school,
B:	but it wasn't the trumpet
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.
B:	I think,
A:	Uh-huh
B:	So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	uh, well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know I mean in Dallas.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I keep thinking about it,
A:	but that doesn't mean it gets done.
A:	I, I mostly jump rope more.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, uh, when I was, uh,
B:	well a while back I was more into basketball
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, but, it has been a while since I have done that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do a toe lift and squats for that.
B:	Right.
A:	But you know it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't, uh, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time.
B:	Right.
A:	They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something at, uh, uh, great length of time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, uh, that is true.
B:	I have noticed that, uh,
A:	And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, then it doesn't bother me very much.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh. That is interesting though.
B:	Uh, I have been thinking of changing, uh,
B:	I have done the same routine for almost two years now
B:	and I am thinking of, uh, changing it up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, uh, get out of the routine.
A:	Right.
B:	Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I am looking at changing things a little bit.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is, uh, I have started doing more push ups
A:	and, and it has helped a lot
A:	and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't try to push it so the end in one set.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	uh, clothing at work.
A:	Um, I work as a news reporter,
A:	and  a lot of,
B:	Oh.
A:	I work in a, since I work in a small station,
A:	this is my first job
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so, I dress very variedly if that's a word.
A:	Um, sometimes I'm shooting and doing photography,
A:	and so I'll be in jeans one day,
A:	and another day I'll be on camera,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I'll be in a suit
A:	and another day I'll come in
A:	and I won't know what I'm doing,
A:	so I'll wear a pant suit in case I have to shoot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, it really varies.
A:	I try to dress very comfortably.
A:	I don't really like dressing up at all.
B:	Oh, me neither
A:	I don't, I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just,
A:	I don't know,
A:	it just, it takes too much time out of my day,
A:	and I don't, I don't know
B:	Yeah,
B:	same here.
B:	I don't mind not wearing any makeup
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't mind it at all. Um.
B:	Um, I work at a bakery because I'm a, still a, a college student. Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	But, we, we have to wear white pants and, um, any color T shirt, as long as it's not like a bright color, like a pastel.
A:	White pants in a bakery.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Wow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the bakers wear all white
A:	Okay.
B:	And we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
B:	and so.
A:	What's the name of the bakery?
A:	Oh, Italian I guess.
B:	Yeah
B:	it's Italian bakery.
B:	And, uh, so, I don't mind having, having to wear a uniform, because I don't have to buy, you know right, as you know, many clothes.
A:	New clothes and stuff.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, I really don't like uniforms but, just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That just bugs me to death.
B:	I know
B:	I do that every day for school
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I, I like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and.
A:	Sweats and.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	when I was in school, I was a sweat monster.
B:	Yeah
A:	All I had was sweats,
A:	and when it was time to go out, I didn't have anything to wear.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	I don't have very many dress clothes
B:	but I don't mind,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't need them yet
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, let me see.
A:	I hate shoes.
A:	If I didn't have to have shoes, I wouldn't have them.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	I just, oh, my feet bother me,
A:	and they're just tedious
B:	Oh.
A:	to go find shoes for me, it's just,
A:	I don't know.
A:	I wear size nine
B:	Oh.
A:	and it, I don't know if just the shoes I get, I either don't like them or they don't fit right,
A:	and I just wish that I could just go without them.
B:	Um.
B:	Oh, wow, I love shoes.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	I always buy shoes
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Just the opposite.
A:	But, um, let's see,
A:	what else do I wear?
A:	Um, if I were in a bigger market, when I do get into a bigger market, I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things, and, uh, where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things
A:	and I could  then I would be able to dress more business-like and things like that,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we're all kind of just out of school at this station,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so we're all, you know, still in sweats, really.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, it's pretty fun though.
B:	I like the look, the, the like suit look, professional like, you know, look,
B:	but I, I really don't have much of an opportunity to wear it
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um  I'm going to be a teacher,
A:	I.
B:	so I'll probably just wear casual clothes, maybe skirts and some.
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I like this, the, uh, suits with the,
A:	they come like with a mini type skirt you know, and the jacket.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I like that,
A:	but but I'm pretty short,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that is cute.
A:	I'm five four,
A:	and so that really doesn't flatter me,
A:	but I think it looks good on taller people.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm five three
B:	and
A:	Are you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	any time I go to the store,
A:	I mean, I, I have like two pairs of pants, because I can never find any that are short enough for me
B:	Oh, really?
A:	and it's just, oh, ridiculous.
A:	Pants, too, I could do without those.
B:	Oh.
A:	Pants, shoes.
B:	I like the like stretch pants, the cotton ones.
A:	Yeah,
A:	those are nice.
B:	They're really comfortable.
A:	Those are nice.
B:	With a baggy sweatshirt.
A:	Yeah,
A:	those are nice.
A:	And, tennis shoes.
A:	My boyfriend's got me these L A Gear.
A:	They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And it, it's just like a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes.
B:	Oh
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	The little ones.
B:	I have a pair of those.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm used to those.
A:	They're just sort of, you know,
A:	like your feet
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, you don't feel them.
A:	You put these things on,
A:	it's, it's, you know, like exercise or something for your feet.
A:	And I have to wear them because he gets upset if I don't.
A:	So so, so how do people in Wisconsin dress?
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	Warm this time  this time, of the year pretty warm.
A:	Warm.
B:	Sweaters and.
A:	I grew up in New York,
A:	and so I know what warm is.
A:	Like five pairs of socks and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	sleeping in sweats or long underwear.
B:	My parents keep the house cold
A:	Hello.
B:	Hi.
A:	Okay,
A:	I pressed one
A:	so I guess we're recording now.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay, um.
B:	Um, as far as spare time, they talked about,
B:	I don't, I think,
B:	who has any spare time
B:	I've got a, a six year old and a, um,
B:	well, my baby's one today.
A:	Um.
B:	Today's his birthday.
A:	Um.
B:	And I'm also, I'm expecting,
B:	and, so, I, I don't know,
B:	I haven't had much spare time lately
B:	but,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I've, I have had some because I was working for P I E,
A:	and they went bankrupt
A:	so I've got quite a bit of spare time right now.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And I've been making dolls, cloth dolls.
B:	Oh, have you?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	You sew the bodies and everything?
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a, they're all cloth.
A:	It's not, uh, any porcelain at all.
B:	So, so you just sew everything up, huh?
A:	Yeah
B:	Oh.
A:	and I make the clothes for them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What kind
A:	And.
B:	do they have yarn hair
B:	or,
A:	Um, no,
A:	you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	I made some of them with that hair
A:	and then, uh, don't ask me what the other hair I made,
A:	it looked like, um, it looked,
A:	well, I made some of them with regular wigs.
B:	Oh, did you?
A:	I went to the flea markets and bought, you know, like the wigs for a dollar.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	It sounds like you're creative.
A:	They looked really cute
B:	Uh, do you sell them?
A:	I have sold five of them, so far.
B:	Oh, have you?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just have to get a place where, you know, I can sell them actually.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I bet.
B:	How long does it take you to make one?
A:	Uh, if I would just work all day long, making the clothes and everything, probably about two and a half days.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	So.
B:	Do you enjoy it?
A:	Yes
B:	Yeah.
A:	I really do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, then I also crochet
A:	and,
B:	I, I, I can crochet and knit.
B:	Um, actually, I started an afghan,
B:	but it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago
A:	Yeah.
B:	and it's sitting in my closet half done right now,
B:	but, it's a knitting one.
B:	And,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I tried knitting first,
A:	but, I don't know,
A:	I, I didn't like it.
B:	Oh, didn't you.
A:	So then I went to crocheting,
A:	but now I want to learn how to knit again.
B:	Oh.
B:	I
A:	You know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I enjoy knitting.
B:	I, I kind of like that,
B:	but I just, like I say, haven't done it for a while.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I do like sewing sometimes.
B:	I, I've made a few of the, you know, just the little valence curtains in my house, and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, it, it's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, in fact, I just bought a serger in December.
B:	oh, I would love one of these.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	I haven't done everything on it yet, you know,
A:	but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it.
B:	Oh, those are wonderful aren't they.
A:	You know, especially making the seams and things like that you know, it's, it's got such a professional finish on them.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	that, and that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It'd be nice to have that.
A:	So I like that.
B:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	And.
B:	Well, do you have, um, uh,
B:	I guess you're kind of young,
B:	I was going to say, do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for.
A:	Well, fifty-seven's not young,
A:	but no,
A:	my son's, has been married for almost ten years,
A:	but they don't have any children.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	So, I just make clothes for my dolls.
B:	Oh, well.
B:	Well, how did you get involved in that?
A:	Just, you know, just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll.
B:	So you did buy a pattern, and then started from there.
A:	And they, they turned out really cute.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you got to have a pattern for the body you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress?
A:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those.
A:	Aren't they cute?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have quite a few of them actually in my house,
B:	I, and most of them I have bought, um, already clothed,
B:	but I did  I did make the dress on one,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I kind of made the pattern up.
B:	It's not, it's probably not the best
B:	but
A:	No,
A:	I, I bought a bunny pattern one time,
A:	but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse.
B:	Oh, it did?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	See, it was too pointed.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I tore it back apart again,
A:	and I haven't tried another one.
B:	You haven't sewn it back up, huh?
A:	No,
A:	but I bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of,
A:	but I haven't made it yet.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, do you do any kind of painting or anything?
A:	No,
A:	I don't paint, except I stenciled my wall.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	I I tried that,
B:	I did, I, I ended up just stenciling a, um, a blind, like a, just a roller shade.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I, I can, I had a hard time stenciling.
B:	For some reason I just couldn't do it.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And people have told me it's very easy.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I, my neighbor did it first
A:	and I seen her house
A:	and I saw how beautiful it looked,
A:	so then I decided well, I was going to do it,
A:	and  uh, it turned out really, really good.
B:	Well.
B:	What design did you use?
A:	Uh, mostly flowers you know.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And, what room?
A:	I've done it in the all, uh, all my rooms.
B:	Have you?
A:	I put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom,
A:	Where are you, Bob?
B:	I am in Plano.
B:	Where are you?
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	I am in Waco.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Right down the street.
A:	Oh, credit cards.
A:	My favorite subject
B:	You mean you use credit cards?
A:	Oh, do I.
B:	I bet you used them all up over Christmas.
A:	Yeah,
A:	mostly over Christmas.
A:	Uh, I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle. Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off
B:	And then your are in debt.
A:	and so then you have no money,
A:	so you use a credit card.
B:	I understand that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I probably have one of every credit card there is.
A:	Do you use them a lot?
B:	Well, uh, it kind of comes and goes, uh,
B:	I use uh, Citibank, the, uh, Advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way.
A:	Oh.
B:	So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that is a good idea.
A:	Is that  that through a VISA?
B:	That is what I,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Huh.
B:	But, uh, I got all sorts of credit cards for my business that I use
B:	but, uh, If I can get away with paying them off every month, it is alright.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If I don't then it gets expensive
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is my problem.
A:	I don't try and pay them off.
A:	I pay, like the minimum.
B:	Well you shouldn't do that.
A:	I know
A:	So I have got myself,
B:	You never, you never get out of the hole that way.
A:	Exactly.
A:	I have got, that is why I have got myself with all this trouble now.
A:	But, I pay most of them on time and everything.
A:	It is just the,
A:	I always have them.
A:	So, it is kind of strange.
B:	Kind of like the federal government right?
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Exactly like the government
A:	In,  In debt.
B:	Can't never get out of debt.
B:	And every time you try to get out of debt, the economy goes to pot because people are spending money, right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have they put the cap on the interest rates?
B:	No.
A:	I didn't know if they actually did that or not.
A:	I know they were considering it.
B:	Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent.
B:	The rest of the, uh, and me, we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Funny how that works, isn't it
B:	The, thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit.
A:	I would be interested to find out how many people, or how much, uh, people use credit this year. Say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one, even nineteen ninety.
A:	I think, I think it would be amazing how much, how many more people use it.
B:	Well, I think so
B:	because the,
A:	Because of the economy.
B:	That's right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at.
A:	Exactly.
A:	I would be very, I would like to see some numbers on that.
A:	I think that would be interesting.
B:	Do you, do you have any, uh, credit union where you work or anything like that?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a credit union.
B:	Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card?
A:	Yeah,
A:	they do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You have got that one.
A:	Yes,
A:	I do
A:	Yes,
A:	I do a matter of fact.
B:	Who, who do you work for?
A:	Uh, I work for Channel six.
B:	Oh.
A:	It's it's an N B C affiliate down here.
B:	I do a lot of work down in Waco,
B:	a lot of, I call on a lot of my business is down there.
A:	Oh really.

A:	right outside.
B:	You know Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there.
A:	So, that is where Davis Iron Works is.
A:	Uh.
B:	Bobby Parker and, uh,
A:	I don't think I have seen that one.
A:	I am sure I pass by it or something,
A:	but I am not sure.
B:	There is a place in Hewett, called,
B:	it is a new company called Prime Air.
B:	That is in Hewett. Just around the corner from Davis Iron Works.
A:	Huh. Prime Air.
B:	They make, uh, humidifiers and uh, filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals, homes, something like that.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Have you ever been to Marlin?
B:	Uh, yeah.
A:	I think it is Marlin or Mart.
A:	They have, uh, uh, a place, I guess that would be similar to Prime Air.
A:	It is called H G H or something like K G H or,
B:	Oh, really.
B:	Huh.
A:	I can't think of it.
A:	I can't think of the name.
B:	Huh.
A:	But,
B:	I will have to stop in there.
B:	I went, I have gone through there, uh,
B:	my oldest son goes to A and M.
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	He is working on his Master's.
B:	The Navy sent him there for his Master's. Mostly in engineering.
B:	So, once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I don't like that drive.
A:	I make that drive sometimes
A:	we have stories out there
A:	but, uh,
B:	There is always a state trooper down there.
A:	Huh.
B:	You have got to drive careful.
A:	Oh, really
A:	I know.
B:	Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour.
A:	Oh, goodness.
A:	They, they are bad at Hewett too. On eighty-four.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They are real bad.
A:	That is where I got my last ticket.
A:	So, of course, I couldn't pay that on a credit card.
A:	Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, um, the care of the elderly.
B:	Yes,
B:	I have.
B:	In fact, uh, just a little over, just a little less than a year ago, uh, my mother went to be with the Lord,
B:	and we cared for her the last, oh, seventeen months of her life here in the, at home. Aside from, uh, having to, uh, take her to the hospital
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you know, those times, well, she was there in the, the regular hospital.
A:	Right.
B:	And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer,
B:	and so the doctor elected to have her, uh, finish out, uh, in the hospice program.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing home, because, uh, she's around her own you know, the, the elderly parent in question is around their own family.
B:	The, uh, hospice program provides a hospital type bed. Well, it is a hospital bed, and all the oxygen, stuff and a, uh, and a visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
A:	Well, that's nice.
B:	And it's all taken care of by, by, uh, Medicare, uh,
B:	and, uh, it, it's, it's really neat, uh.
B:	And I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't banish, uh, my old loved one to a, to a warehouse.
A:	No.
B:	And that's, that's what I basically, uh, view a nursing home as, a warehouse,
B:	so that's,
A:	It's really sad
B:	Pardon me?
A:	It's really a sad situation.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I think a lot of people struggle with.
A:	I,  I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, you know, the parent is,  doesn't always want the in-law living in the house.
B:	Oh .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Right.
A:	Well, that's really sad.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know.
B:	But, uh, in this case, uh, spouse and I, uh, are, uh, we're, are, are, uh, united in this area because,  I guess her father, her grandfather and grandmother both lived with, uh, her parents, uh, their golden years too,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so this isn't like, uh, uh, just one, one, uh, instance.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact, uh, her, uh, uh, experiences were, were invaluable to me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, in fact, I don't know if I could have, uh, held up, uh, you know, without my wife, uh, helping in this,  this, in this case.
A:	Right.
A:	Yes.
A:	Well, I know when the, I remember being a child
A:	and my grandmother had had several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents tried to keep her in the house,
A:	and they did for a long time. I couldn't,  tell you how long, until she got, uh, where she had to have complete care,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so ,  they couldn't, you know, keep her in the house anymore,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was really hard on everyone.
A:	She had to have, you know, twenty-four hour a day care.
A:	And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that, um, they put her there,
A:	and we all went just constantly until she died.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But it was very hard on everyone to see, you know, grandmother be like that,
A:	and I don't know that, you know, I don't, being so young, I don't remember why. You know, what was, why she had to go there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, maybe, well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way.
B:	Oh, boy,
B:	yeah.
A:	And that that, they couldn't, they found that they could not you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, then, then there's almost, then there's almost no, no, uh, uh, choice left to her then
A:	No,
A:	but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, you know,  in the nursing home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I do remember the other patients there, uh, being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone.
B:	Right.
B:	In fact, just, uh, just, uh, sit and chat with them for five minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	And I guess that's hard on people to give, give up their lives.
A:	If they're busy they don't you know.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, I guess.
B:	Right.
A:	If you can afford them.
A:	But, anyway. Well, I'm,  glad it worked out good for your family.
B:	And then, then,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it did,
B:	and I was just I just praised the Lord that, that we were able to, uh, have, uh, uh,
A:	I pushed it.
B:	Okay.
A:	So what do you you in your lawn?
A:	Do you do it yourself
A:	or do you hire someone to do it?
B:	Uh, no
B:	we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, uh, find that it's really a little more economical,
B:	and we have, oh, I find that I have the time,
B:	and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas.
B:	I used to live in Arizona,
B:	and it was very very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering system
B:	and it was, it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But over here we get enough water you know, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers,
B:	and so it's a lot more rewarding
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so.
A:	Well, we do our own out here, uh, you know, mow it ourselves and everything,
A:	but, uh, our water supply right now is bad.
A:	We need rain badly
B:	Oh, that's right.
A:	Uh, we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So.
B:	Is that enough during the hotter times of the year?
A:	It was this last summer,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, now if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	but, uh, yeah,
A:	we do our our, you know, mowing ourselves and everything,
A:	and I do our planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting, which I never did before
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold, um  they'd freeze down,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and by the time they, the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
A:	Oh.
B:	So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding,
B:	so um, I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that, you know, feels.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We have quite a few roses.
A:	I just, uh, we, in fact we just pruned them way down,
A:	and I just had to replace one of them,
A:	so I just bought that yesterday,
A:	and I'll probably go outside today and plant that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long.
B:	Yeah,
B:	those are enjoyable.
A:	I even had, uh, roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty, you know
B:	Oh, did you?
B:	Uh-huh
A:	But, um, other than the roses I don't have too many flowers.
A:	I plant gladiolas
B:	Um, those are nice.
A:	and those are always pretty,
A:	but they get so tall,
A:	and they, they bend over so fast you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I haven't done much in, in bulbs.
B:	In fact I received as a Christmas present a, a planter that had bulbs in it, that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window,
B:	and it it just grew like crazy,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I don't have any flowers on it.
B:	I don't know how long that takes, or if there's anything I need to do differently.
A:	Um.
B:	It's just nice and green right now
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, is it that, one of those Amaryllis?
B:	Uh, no
A:	No,
A:	huh.
B:	I'm thinking White Narcissus or something like a like a white paper flower or so.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, uh.
A:	Do you have a big yard?
B:	No,
B:	not really,
B:	and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, uh, they have just the, the minimum square footage for lots, to where you get a little bit of a backyard,
B:	we have a pool in our backyard,
B:	and we did plan it to where we have some, some play yard left over,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's, it's, um, you know, very small.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything else in the backyard
A:	Yeah,
A:	right,
A:	right.
B:	that's about the size of most of them.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So, uh I guess we're kind of fortunate.
A:	Um.
B:	Everyone looks at that, with our at our yard with kind of sense of awe, like wow, you really got, you know, some grass back there.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well.
A:	Well, that makes it nice.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool,
A:	but we don't have one you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but we just, we just have dogs and, um, and grass you know, the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So we do have a garden, you know.
A:	It's just a small one, you know,
A:	but we, had lots of tomatoes, and, uh, zucchini
B:	Oh.
A:	it's amazing what you can get out of a little
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, it's probably about twenty by, I don't know, twenty by six, something like that,
A:	and it's amazing what you can, you know, how many plants you can plant in there
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	but it was nice.
A:	Few cucumbers.
B:	That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet,
B:	and I don't think this yard is a very,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten, I guess, I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns
A:	and I think there should be limitations of, like semiautomatics.
A:	Uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody.
A:	In fact, you know, I can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose.
A:	Uh, so I guess, you know, being that I come from a hunting family I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, uh, things that people would use for sporting type of, uh, a, activity.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Those would be fine
A:	but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, I would say yes
A:	we need to put restrictions on them
B:	Uh, that's I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and uh, hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly,
A:	for self-protection,
A:	sure.
B:	Right.
B:	And, but I think the, I think semiautomatic weapons, people say they use them because it, for sport.
B:	But I, I personally cannot see any use for them  other than, uh, for, for, like people who dislike have some sort of crazed you know, ambition to use, have high powered weapons or something.
A:	I can't imagine that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	To do massive amounts of killing, uh,
B:	Right.
B:	And  I mean, you can only, how much do you
A:	Yeah.
A:	The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, uh, uh, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, uh, very dangerous
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, uh, get him down.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, you know, I, I think of my family.
A:	Uh, they're very much into sporting and, uh, you know, as far as hunting and also like, uh, clay pigeons things like that.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So they have may have some shotguns.
A:	They may have other type of, uh, hunting type things,
A:	but I figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know what I'm saying  versus a, you know, a small handgun, uh,  that can be, you know, put right in your coat pocket
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
A:	and nobody would see it,
A:	but yet, you can't stop people from having, you know, a handgun in their home.
B:	Right.
A:	Even if there are small children around, there's, you know, you can't say people with small children can't have guns
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and people without small children that may have grandchildren, you know  still have these guns
B:	Yeah.
A:	but uh, I guess I, I was always taught, number one, a gun isn't a toy.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, you know, and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, you know  and don't ever play with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, so I don't know if that makes a difference or what
A:	but,
B:	Well, I think uh, in that I think that cases like that it's definitely, um, I think if you're to say okay,
B:	we have to get rid of them all because you know, they can only, they only seem to do bad, it, it's, uh, it's saying we're
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	The criminals would get them. I mean even if they had to go across border to get them.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	And people who, people who have them and are responsible with them are, are, are being punished
B:	and people who and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to, how to, uh, .
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	How to use, you know, to make sure the guns are put up as something as  uh, not a toy.
B:	Right.
B:	Right
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and not that they were laying on the, uh, couch or anything like that
B:	Right.
A:	but, uh, I never had an interest in them, being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
B:	Right.
A:	and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
B:	Right.
A:	and, of course we were quite young
A:	and we went through, uh, the National Rifle, uh, Club
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we were taught, you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay,
A:	if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly
A:	and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but yet have this, training so that kids aren't you know,
A:	they have to have a certain respect for it.
B:	Right.
B:	Well I think, I mean we, I grew up in a family
B:	and, and my father had two guns
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because he used to hunt years ago
B:	but he stopped before, really before I was old enough to remember.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, and I knew we had the guns in the house
B:	and, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
A:	Sure,
A:	yeah.
B:	but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor I never, I mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun
B:	or let's go get the gun
B:	it was just something you knew was there
A:	Yes.
B:	and it was your father's
B:	and you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think maybe, uh, and that's the type of, the thing that should be, you know, stressed.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so
A:	and I don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
A:	Okay
B:	So, do you have, do you have the long,
B:	I guess not, not if there's,
B:	see I was raised in New York,
B:	but I guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season, do you?
A:	Uh, well, we probably have about three months, approximately.
B:	Do do you do your own gardening?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you.
A:	We live on a,
A:	used to be a farm,
A:	but we don't farm much,
A:	we, uh, but we do have a garden.
B:	Huh. See I got mine in,
B:	well, let's see,
B:	I put in pepper plants this weekend.
A:	Oh.
A:	I wish I could be doing that
B:	Yeah.
B:	I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen
B:	and, I enjoy tinkering with it, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's pretty hot down here during the Summer,
B:	we hit, you know, a hundred, hundred and two sometimes,
A:	Right.
B:	but, you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff, like that.
A:	You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I can, usually I can put in, oh probably mid-March, I can put anything in the ground, you know, beets, and onions, and stuff like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But then I have to wait for my,
B:	tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	You've had more freezing this Winter, or this, yeah, Winter, I think.
B:	Yeah.
B:	We've, had just a few, you know, that freezes a little here and there,
A:	More bad weather.
B:	but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's pretty tough.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Are you, do you work,
A:	or are you retired
A:	or you,
B:	No.
B:	I work, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm only forty years old.
B:	I have to work,
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh, my husbands retired.
A:	But he's not a gardener.
A:	He, he, he's been helping me more,
A:	but he really isn't, uh, real crazy about gardening.
B:	Uh, I, I really enjoy it,
B:	it gives me time outdoors,
A:	Uh.
B:	and, you know, I'm a golfer,
B:	but, it gives me time outdoors, and time around my house,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn,
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I usually have a pretty nice lawn,
B:	it's a lot of work you know,
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	but it's,
A:	But it's a pleasure to, like you said, it's good to get outside,
A:	and and I like, I like my garden too
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	We didn't have to, we have just a small garden,
A:	but we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we, we didn't have too good luck with it,
A:	because the, uh, we had a couple of good, real good wind storms,
A:	and it really damaged the corn
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	so we didn't get too much corn, last year.
B:	We're going through that,
B:	we going through the dust storms down here now,
A:	uh, uh-huh.
B:	so, but I, uh, what I did with my garden, is I have a, a two by six frame that's five by ten.
B:	I have two of them sitting side by side
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then I put, uh, like, a black plastic,
B:	it's really not a black plastic.
B:	They call it Wedet
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I put that down,
B:	and then I put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
A:	Huh.
B:	and I use a, one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I waste it up and down there a couple of times,
B:	and I only have to water about two hours a week
A:	Oh that's great.
B:	and it's pretty nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We don't, we don't usually cover ours.
A:	We did a few different times
A:	sometimes we've covered with the plastic,
A:	and other years we've tried newspapers
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, but we generally don't, we do our watering from our spring.
B:	Oh you have a spring,
A:	Yeah.
B:	how nice.
A:	We have an old fashioned pipe sitting, that, you know, water runs into
A:	and, my husband set up a pump that runs,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it runs first down
A:	and then it stops,
B:	Oh that's, that's pretty nice.
A:	and when the water comes up, it comes on again,
A:	and we use that to water our garden with
A:	so,
B:	But you actually enjoy it, huh?
A:	Oh I do.
A:	I do.
B:	Do you?
A:	I love it,
B:	Get out there on your hands and knees, and crawl around.
A:	I'd rather be doing that, than housework
B:	I, I can imagine.
B:	You all have much trouble up there, with insects
B:	or,
A:	Uh, not a well, not a whole lot.
A:	I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that in we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the, the,
B:	With the worms?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs, and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet.
A:	Uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you go more for natural, keeping them off naturally,
A:	or do you, use insecticides?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I try to,
B:	no
B:	I, uh, uh, try not to use any insecticides at all.
B:	I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, I, sometimes I can't manage.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, our lawn, is, is a big lawn because, because we live out in the country,
A:	and so we were not, our lawn is not perfect, you know,
A:	it's just the it's just a lawn
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, mine's full of dandelions, now,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so,
A:	Do you eat any of them?
B:	No,
B:	I never have.
B:	I don't know how to prepare them.
A:	Oh, did, well, did, does your wife ever make, uh, bake in a hot bacon dressing, like for, salad?
B:	No.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Oh it's delicious
A:	and it goes real good on dandelions.
B:	Really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
B:	I've never eaten dandelions
B:	now I've tried dandelion wine
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.
A:	use the greens, if you get them when they're young and tender, you know, before they have grown too, too tall,
B:	Yeah.
A:	because they do get a little stringy.
B:	All right.
A:	But, uh, they're kind of fun to, to try,
B:	Yeah.
A:	get a, get a few
A:	and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes.
B:	I'll try that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I sure will
A:	Uh, but I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back,
A:	and he's been having trouble with
A:	so, wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,
B:	Oh, Oh.
A:	so, it takes about four hours to cut our grass.
B:	Yow.
A:	And, we have, we have hills.
A:	I'm afraid of the hills
A:	but, I'm getting on to it,
B:	So you all are into, so you all are into the lawn, big time, huh.
A:	I just pretend they're not there,
A:	and I just go ahead and do it
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I only get, well, I guess I got
B:	my, my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	then I have a pretty nice backyard,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you know, I've got enough room to throw horseshoes. You know, couple of other ,
A:	Oh, that's great.
A:	great.
A:	That's, a lot of people don't have that much space even.
B:	No,
B:	and it's nice.
B:	I'm just inside the city limits,
B:	I'm probably a mile, mile and a half inside the city limits,
B:	and I'm only a mile, and a half from work.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you have all the conveniences of, a city,
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's pretty nice.
A:	yeah,
A:	and, and the country also.
B:	I have the room outside I need,
B:	and I don't really have all the room in the house I need
B:	but,
A:	Well, you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything.
B:	No.
B:	I have a question to ask you about gardening though.
B:	You know, those,
B:	what are they called,
B:	the, they called, uh, rolly polly bugs,
B:	that's what my son calls them anyway.
A:	Rolly Polly what?
B:	Rolly Polly bugs.
B:	The ones that roll up in a ball.
B:	I don't know what they're called.
A:	Is it a bug, You mean?
B:	They look like they've got,
B:	Yeah.
A:	A worm?
B:	Yeah.
A:	A cutworm?
B:	No.
A:	Not a grub worm?
B:	It's not like a,
B:	no.
B:	You find them under bricks and all that stuff, where it's moist,
B:	and if, if you touch them, they roll up in a ball.
A:	Oh.
B:	I don't know what they call them.
B:	But I'm plagued with those things,
A:	Uh.
B:	and I haven't figured out,
B:	I even called the nursery,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind, they could be.
B:	I, I don't know.
A:	You find them under bricks usually, and that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	under bricks, or under wood,
B:	or you know, if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long, they get in there.
B:	They usually come out at night,
B:	but, you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around,
A:	They're not a slug.
B:	No.
A:	Not a,
B:	A slug is actually kind of slimy
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and these are just,
B:	he plays with them all time,
B:	Really.
A:	It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football.
A:	Is that all they're going to have to make money, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I didn't think that was the objective, to make money.
A:	But it seems like it is.
B:	Huh. It really is.
B:	I know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program. To get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You went to Indiana University?
B:	Uh, Purdue.
A:	Oh Purdue,
A:	okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, good.
B:	So.
A:	You're, you're a T I up in Sherman?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, very good.
B:	Are you from Dallas area?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	I'm in the facilities there, down here in Dallas.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess football is the big sport down here, isn't it.
A:	Uh, certainly high school football, and college football,
A:	but again high school football is just so much fun to watch,
A:	because, uh, you know, not everybody plays of course, but they're still,
A:	it's good
A:	and it's still,
A:	you know the kids,
A:	and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and you know they're going to class, you know.
B:	You heard of, Have you heard of Damon Bailey. The I U white guard that plays.
A:	It, it's, it's real amateur sports.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Well, last year, when he was in high school, they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals, when he played.
A:	Is that right?
A:	I never heard ,
A:	that's, uh,
A:	I never been in a football game in high school that had that many.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that's, I mean, that's pretty big.
B:	Like he's from Indiana,
B:	and he plays for Indiana now.
B:	And, Indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there.
B:	The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd
B:	You know, the high school games, I mean, that seems to be the big attraction, and college.
A:	Well, my office mate here, Earl, he, he goes to all the Maverick games
A:	and he loves that.
A:	He, he would be,
A:	this is a great question for him, uh, to talk about
A:	Like he's got,
A:	I'm looking at his calendar,
A:	he's got all over the place,
A:	and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything.
A:	But, I, I, I can't get interested at all,
A:	zero.
A:	I, I listen to him,
A:	and occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven,
A:	but gee,
A:	I can't, uh,
A:	more than five minutes of a basketball game, just seems about,
A:	that's it,
A:	of, uh, pro anyway.
B:	Yeah,
B:	seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play,
A:	Yeah.
B:	then it'd be the same result.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because they, they start,
B:	they shoot so much,
B:	and then the last, what, five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work.
A:	Mavericks had, oh two players this year that they got rid of last year.
A:	I'll think of them in a minute.
A:	Perkins, Sam Perkins,
A:	can't think of the other one.
A:	They're both.
B:	Tarpley,
B:	is he one?
A:	Pardon me?
B:	Tarpley?
A:	Yeah,
A:	Tarpley,
A:	and they both left this past year,
A:	and both of them were on playoff teams, uh,
A:	so, they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And Sam Perkins, here, he's one guy I did follow
A:	from,
A:	think he was in Virginia,
A:	I can't think of what school he went to,
A:	but from.
A:	I guess he's been here about five, six, seven years in the pros.
A:	And he was,
A:	he never quite achieved the, you know, the super stardom that he had in, in college,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, basketball, they have a nice,
A:	I don't know if you've down to the sports for Reunion Arena.
A:	It's,
A:	Well, what kind of garden do you have?
B:	Well, we've tried having,
B:	let me turn the T V off,
B:	we've tried having a vegetable garden,
B:	and I'm from Chicago,
B:	and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.
B:	And we have tried several years in a row,
B:	and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,
B:	and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
A:	Oh.
B:	We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,
B:	and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it,
B:	but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, right now we're just,
A:	Do you have a lawn?
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.
B:	We have a peach tree.
B:	That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply.
B:	But that's nice to have
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	yeah.
B:	So what do you do up there?
A:	Well, um, actually it,
A:	we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
B:	Um.
A:	And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and the roses have been blooming for two weeks,
A:	and the grass is, uh, this lush green,
A:	and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, you know, I just keep looking at,
A:	and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
B:	Really.
B:	Gosh.
A:	But, and my garden, you know,
A:	my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
B:	Oh, boy
A:	the plants and,
B:	that sounds wonderful.
A:	you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know,
A:	we'll have a freeze.
B:	If you don't have a frost you'll be all right
B:	That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost
B:	and half the stuff would get frostbitten,
B:	and you'd have to.
A:	Well, that's it.
A:	Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January,
A:	and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it,
A:	and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
B:	Wow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
B:	Oh, boy,
B:	that's frustrating.
A:	So, but yeah,
A:	it, it's interesting,
A:	and I enjoy gardening.
A:	My son does the mowing of the grass.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me
A:	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.
B:	I love gardens that are well tended,
B:	and I just,
B:	there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just
B:	I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,
B:	and just,
B:	I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long.
B:	And, uh, I, I was in England once,
B:	and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.
B:	You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.
B:	Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
A:	Oh, they help you.
B:	So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you
A:	Oh dear.
A:	Oh but that's nice, you know,
A:	I mean the peach tree is, is a start
A:	and,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's really lovely.
B:	I would love to have different fruit trees.
B:	It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.
B:	They're just delicious.
B:	And, we, we we have, still have to spray some,
B:	but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,
B:	because I just,
B:	I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.
A:	Right.
A:	What about tomatoes,
A:	aren't they pretty hardy?
B:	Um, we've tried them,
B:	but again, it's just like the sun scorch.
A:	Oh.
B:	We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the
B:	I mean it's just,
B:	you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,
A:	Oh.
B:	and um, that's really what makes the most sense,
B:	because you don't have to use so much water,
B:	and
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it really does the job.
B:	But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.
B:	And if you're not really committed to it,
B:	I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,
B:	and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something,
B:	and by then it's burned up, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,
B:	so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that
A:	Well, I would assume, too,
A:	I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it just gets so hot so fast here.
B:	We don't have really a Spring or a Fall
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it just, uh, immediately heats up.
B:	So, that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, um, you know, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.
B:	It was really nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.
B:	In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it.
B:	I'll never forget.
B:	Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.
B:	I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him
B:	They remodeled the entire back yard.
B:	Then they sold the house and got divorced,
B:	so I don't know what that says about it all
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.
A:	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really was.
B:	I enjoyed it there.
B:	But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,
B:	because they like to see things grow.
B:	They've done a couple of little seed projects,
B:	and so I think it would be fun for them.
A:	Oh, sure,
A:	sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full
B:	Oh, yes
B:	They're both running around now.
A:	And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,
A:	but it's not off the list.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, it's very therapeutic,
B:	I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They certainly enjoy that part of it
B:	It's just trying to keep anything.
B:	I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring
B:	and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,
B:	and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
A:	Oh.
B:	He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?
B:	At least he didn't eat them,
B:	I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.
A:	Right.
A:	Maybe next year they'll do better.
B:	Yeah,
B:	really.
B:	If they survive this year.
B:	Oh, well, good luck to you.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, thanks.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	It was nice talking to you too.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay
B:	Have you ever, uh, organized a family reunion?
A:	Uh, no
A:	I have never organized one.
A:	But we are, we have one, uh, we are going to have one on Memorial Day, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They have had one the last two years. We go out to the, my dad's farm and, uh, and, you know, it is just a picnic and spend the night. Go fishing and stuff like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	How many people usually show up?
A:	Oh, about ten.
B:	Oh, it is not that big.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Because, uh, we have had sort of weekends like that too.
A:	It,
B:	But I never thought of it really as a reunion.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I sort of think of a reunion with my, uh, all the extended family
A:	Everybody,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California.
B:	And some is in New York and North Carolina,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it gets,
B:	it is kind of hard to get get everybody organized.
B:	Uh, is there someone,
B:	do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there?
B:	Or,
A:	Uh, yes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My, my, uh, dad has a house out there anyway.
B:	And there is, there is, uh,
B:	he keeps a uh, food out there, year round.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, so he does not live there though?
A:	Uh, no.
A:	It is, it is, it is like a country, country home.
B:	Vacation home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It sounds nice. Uh,
B:	are there kids that are there too, or mostly adults?
A:	Yeah.
A:	The grandchildren.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just a few.
A:	It just depends,
A:	uh, uh, all my grandparents are dead so, uh, there is, there are not, you know, none of them are there.
A:	And, and, uh, then an uncle is dead.
A:	So the, the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Are you all located in Texas?
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	We are in, we are all, uh,
A:	like they live up in Sherman.
A:	It is near Lake Texoma.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	uh, all of his children live in the Dallas area too.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	That to me is,
B:	yeah,
B:	Dallas I know of,
B:	Houston I know of,
B:	and that is about it In Texas.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, you know, we have, uh, well,
B:	we all got together,
B:	it was about two years ago for,
B:	I was,
B:	I had graduated from college.
B:	And, uh, I was going to live in France for a year.
B:	And so my parents invited,
B:	it was not just family,
B:	it was friends too.
B:	But, uh, we all got together for just a party.
B:	And that was kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.
A:	French reunion?
B:	Well, not quite French,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, it was sort of a reunion before leaving.
B:	It was fun.
B:	It was on, uh, New Year's Day.
B:	So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It was kind of fun.
B:	But, uh, but who was it?
B:	A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago
B:	and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.
B:	And it really sounded like it was fun.
B:	But, I am not quite sure what I would do.
B:	I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace, and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know. And have different areas to explore and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So that would be kind of fun.
B:	Yep.
B:	Where nobody lives
A:	Right.
B:	But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they do not have to clean up afterwards.
B:	Yep.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That is for sure.
B:	The cleaning up can be a mess.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But uh, do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm?
A:	I am, I am sorry?
B:	Does, does your dad have horses there?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	he does not really have any, any, uh, uh, domestic livestock anyway.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, he leased, uh, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.
B:	I see,
B:	so it's,
B:	so he really does use it as a vacation home.
B:	It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Pretty much.
A:	He has a garden and, uh, a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that sounds nice.
B:	Do people actually pick the fruit and things?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then there is wild blackberries there too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, used to, we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property,
A:	he gets,
B:	but we never got enough.
B:	I used to make jam,
B:	but I never had enough to really make, you know, more than a jar or something.
A:	Huh.
B:	So it was not so worth it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Depends on the rain.
B:	That sounds,
B:	is,
B:	does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there?
A:	Uh,
A:	it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.
B:	Well, that is pretty big
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I do not know how they do scale down there.
B:	You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because they,
B:	is
B:	this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres. As opposed to tens of acres.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
A:	and most of it, you know,
A:	you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We kind of have a, an informal contest.
A:	My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago.
A:	Well, he put some crappie too.
A:	But the bass,
A:	we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.
A:	So,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they are in there, but they are real spooky.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think my dad put some.
B:	We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.
B:	And,
B:	I mean really little.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,
B:	and there were too many little goldfish,
B:	and so the big ones never got bigger.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
A:	Never saw the bass?
B:	No.
A:	Oh.
B:	So we do not know whether it is living
B:	or,
A:	Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.
B:	Yep.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We still have lots of little goldfish.
B:	They propagate pretty well, those little fish.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah,
A:	they really do.
B:	because we started,
B:	we have got hundreds in there now,
B:	and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know, no matter how many it was for a dollar.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.
A:	Oh,
B:	And,
A:	yeah.
B:	It,
A:	They
A:	there is a, uh,
A:	you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.
A:	I do not know if they would live very well up in New York,
A:	but they get huge.
A:	And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, yeah.
B:	We could see.
B:	I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way.
B:	But catfish do, I think.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, that,
B:	you mean,
B:	well, we could try it.
B:	That is a good idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh,
B:	I forget,
B:	there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.
B:	And it was really funny,
B:	because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond,
B:	and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.
B:	And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond
B:	And that night he came out, and the trap was gone.
B:	And it was a raccoon that had taken it.
B:	So it was really funny.
B:	And you could see that, you know,
B:	you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is what happens
B:	But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?
A:	Yeah
A:	And, uh, we feed the catfish.
A:	They feed the catfish like, uh, every couple of weeks.
A:	And, uh, and sometimes that is the best time to catch them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because they will just, they will just come after anything then.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you could catch a couple anyway during that time.
B:	What do you feed them?
A:	Uh, mixed Purina, uh,
A:	it is, uh, cat food, uh, catfish food.
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it is especially made for catfish.
A:	But,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know, it is, uh, it looks like Purina High Pro.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That is funny.
A:	But they come up to the top.
A:	And it is the best time to take pictures,
A:	because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.
A:	And they're,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I have never seen catfish, you know, except in filleted on a plate, I think maybe.
B:	I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I have never seen them, just alive someplace.
B:	That would be fun to see.
A:	Well, they are really funny fish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they try to hit you with their tails.
B:	How big do they get?
A:	Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh,
A:	I think the world record is fifty some pounds.
A:	Uh,
B:	Do you know?
A:	that, that is only about three and a half feet long.
B:	That is pretty big though.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Yeah.
A:	they get real fat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, from the time,
A:	they, they stay slender until they get to be, uh, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing
A:	And I think that was when she was three.
A:	And she caught a catfish by accident.
A:	She was fishing for sunfish.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she said, "Here," and she handed me her rod and reel
A:	And, and, uh, you know, it was just pulling drag out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That sounds amazing.
B:	I will have to see them sometime.
B:	But, all righty.
A:	Okay.
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Enjoy your, uh, weekend.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have a nice Memorial weekend.
B:	Okay.
B:	You too.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay,
A:	now you can tell me what you do.
B:	Uh, well, I work with computers, just like your son
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I actually do research in speech recognition
A:	Oh, great.
B:	part of the reason I'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, I was working
B:	well, actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se uh, recently
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	Well, the one John works for seems to have a you know, good benefits,
A:	and the pay is decent.
B:	Yeah
B:	the, uh,
B:	well actually, where I was working the company
B:	one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days I think are really important
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because health care is so ridiculously expensive.
B:	Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But and I'm,
B:	we actually had a little baby so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.
A:	Oh,
A:	Great,
A:	I had, I had a granddaughter
B:	Oh, congratulations.
B:	And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits
B:	because it's more important with a family
A:	Right.
B:	and you know, our doctor's routine doctor's visits covered,
B:	my health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you have major medical benefits?
B:	Right, yeah,
B:	but I don't,
A:	That, that helps some,
A:	if,
A:	it depends on what your deductible is how high it is.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, my,
B:	our deductible's five hundred
B:	but it's for each event.
A:	Each person.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's pretty that's pretty high,
B:	Right
B:	but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick
A:	Right.
B:	it doesn't cover doctor's visits, things like that.
A:	That's, that's right.
A:	And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical, too.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	it certainly is.
B:	Uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know where my daughter works,
A:	now she, she,
A:	course we live in a, a rural sort of setting
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and where she works she has no benefits at all.
B:	Wow.
A:	And her wage is not, not very good
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's, it's the type of area we live in.
A:	Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.
B:	And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.
A:	Well, she has to pay for it herself
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.
A:	But, uh
B:	So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,
B:	and so the insurance would cost lower,
A:	Uh, well, from what I've seen,
A:	from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,
A:	they're not that much different.
B:	Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.
A:	Is that right?
B:	And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, good doctors in Boston.
A:	Wow
A:	that's a big difference.
B:	And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But that's a huge difference just between
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	should be.
B:	So I was pretty shocked at that.
B:	But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,
B:	and most companies don't have,
B:	some are starting to have, is day care
B:	because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.
B:	And I'd go to work,
B:	and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.
A:	And it would be much more convenient.
A:	Yeah
B:	And I,
A:	it would be more convenient, too.
B:	It would be more convenient, more productive I think,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	My other daughter works and has,
A:	they have to take their two children to day care, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it, it's,
A:	I don't know how they do it,
A:	I really don't. You know,
A:	getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and, all the preparations.
B:	And, and your hours are, much more constrained and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, that, to me, well, that, you know,
B:	those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans
B:	but,
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you can get those benefits even, uh,
A:	they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.
B:	Right
B:	because you're, you know,
B:	certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I would certainly accept a lower salary for that. You know, everything else being equal
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	it would make it a lot better.
B:	because your life would be so much easier.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there's a question of quality of life also.
A:	Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and, you, you, you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened. And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
B:	But unfortunately, there aren't,
B:	I think I B M has started having that in certain locations.
A:	I don't know,
A:	my daughter, one daughter works for M C I,
A:	and they don't, they, where she works they don't have anything like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that locally?
A:	Uh, Pittsburgh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
B:	Yeah
B:	because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, um, any where between ten and forty hours a week. And, um, call my own days, call my own hours,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, so they were very flexible
B:	Yeah,
A:	and that, that would be great,
A:	yeah.
B:	and which
B:	many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	So it all depends on what your position is there, too.
A:	True,
A:	well, that's true in any, any company, I think.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've, I've never, well I can't say I've never,
A:	I've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the you know, out of the home
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady.
B:	Was that when you were, um, well,
B:	those have its pluses and minuses, too.
B:	I've been a consultant recently and so I don't have any benefits at all
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	and the same thing
B:	my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um, they, they, they,
A:	Usually consultants make very good income.
B:	Right,
B:	and they, they refuse to give him more salary.
A:	Is that right?
B:	Because they say they can't pay more than this and that, and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that
A:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, times are rough now,
B:	so it's, new,
B:	it's harder to get the, uh, you know, increases and things
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, um,
A:	A consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know
B:	Yeah,
B:	well he's,
A:	so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits.
B:	Right,
B:	well, he's been doing a long term,
B:	he's being called a consultant,
B:	and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, they, they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits,
B:	he doesn't get, well
A:	Um.
B:	we don't care about retirement benefits.
B:	He doesn't get, um, vacation benefits
B:	and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So really his salary should be, you know, twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that, not including the fact that you know, it's a less, long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they'll do it,
A:	Do you or your husband work for T I,
A:	or
B:	I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, uh, Data Switchboard
A:	Oh, are you,
A:	Oh, I see.
A:	Well, that's neat.
B:	and, uh, do you work for T I?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.
B:	Oh, you sound very young like just out of college
A:	Right,
A:	I try to,
A:	I try to think of myself as young,
A:	but, uh, well, have you seen any movies recently?
B:	Uh, I'm trying to think,
B:	we saw, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	and, uh, have you seen that one?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't,
A:	I have, have a hard time with movies that are real long.
B:	That was excellent.
A:	I don't know.
B:	Well, so oddly enough, I do too,
B:	I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
B:	and, uh, I'm trying to think,
B:	we went to see a, uh, a real funny one,
B:	I can't think now what the name of it was
B:	I've gone blank.
A:	We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF
B:	Oh, we have not seen that,
B:	we want to see that one.
A:	and that was, that was pretty funny,
A:	and then we saw,
A:	what was the spoof on TOP GUN,
A:	it's
B:	Oh, I haven't seen that one.
A:	oh, I can't think of what that was called.
A:	We saw that too,
A:	I was pretty disappointed in that one.
B:	Were you.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh, so, you know, through the summer,
A:	we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.
B:	My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,
B:	he likes to rent them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh,
A:	Have you seen GHOSTS yet?
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	I really, I enjoyed that movie,
B:	Did you?
B:	Now I, I was real disappointed
A:	Really.
B:	I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I was really disappointed in it,
B:	it
B:	one,
B:	I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,
B:	and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and, uh, and it wasn't you know, at all,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	well,
A:	Yeah.
B:	it was, it was more of a love story
A:	Yeah,
B:	and, uh, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We just got through watching one with, uh, uh, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, uh, enjoyed it,
A:	Uh, Van Damme,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think,
B:	I can't think what the name of
B:	it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and we enjoyed that,
B:	and, uh, the, uh, uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?
A:	Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
B:	Yes.
A:	Yes,
A:	I did.
B:	Wasn't that excellent?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I really enjoyed that a lot.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was one that, that stayed with me you know, for a month,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I just,
B:	I kept thinking about it, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's amazing,
A:	but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie
B:	No.
A:	and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,
B:	Oh, it was excellent,
B:	and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, I think he made the movie,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I do too,
A:	I really did
B:	Yeah,
A:	you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,
A:	I agree with you.
B:	Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?
A:	Oh, Hopkins,
A:	I'm sorry
B:	Hopkins,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Hopkins,
A:	yeah.
A:	I always get those mixed up.
B:	I know
B:	I know.
B:	It, uh, well,
B:	I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,
B:	but I thought she was good in that.
A:	Well, I
A:	well, I haven't been,
A:	I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,
A:	and I thought that was a pretty good movie,
A:	but I thought she,
B:	Now, I didn't see that one.
A:	That was, that was pretty interesting movie,
A:	and, uh, but, you know, I, I did,
A:	I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
A:	that was really intriguing,
A:	and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,
A:	and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,
A:	that's not why I go
B:	No,
B:	no
A:	so,
B:	I like a good suspenseful story,
A:	Right,
A:	and that one was.
B:	and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,
B:	in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,
B:	because, he didn't
A:	Oh, he didn't see it?
B:	he won't go see that,
B:	no,
A:	Oh.
B:	I went with, uh, our daughter and, uh, so, you know, saw it with her, and, uh, enjoyed it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Did you see it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen it.
B:	Oh, I've seen it, you know,
B:	we saw it at the movies,
B:	and then we've rented it several times
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, we just love it,
B:	in fact we have a ten year old grandson that,
B:	he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle you know, just get hysterical.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've seen that.
A:	It's pretty, it's pretty cute.
A:	I guess, you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	yes,
A:	I love that movie,
B:	My husband liked that
A:	Yeah,
A:	so,
B:	uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me,
A:	but I'm a big, uh, Mel Brooks fan
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	all his movies, I really, really .
B:	He has a new one out.
A:	He does?
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I have seen it advertised.
B:	I don't know what the name of it is.
A:	Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that came out, like early in the summer or something like that.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I haven't seen that one either.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my husband wants to see that one,
B:	and, uh, did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the, uh, the sheriff
A:	Oh, BLAZING SADDLES.
B:	BLAZING SADDLES.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better.
B:	Did you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,
A:	I just really enjoyed it,
A:	and, uh, um, I'm trying to think,
A:	because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.
A:	I'm trying to remember what it was,
A:	because it, you know, it's,
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
A:	Capital punishment.
B:	Okay,
B:	what's your views on it?
A:	Um, for myself, I'm personally against it,
A:	but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.
B:	Correct.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, I'm for it.
B:	I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.
B:	I, I feel like that child molestation and murder
B:	I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.
B:	I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,
B:	and of course Texas has it, but they very seldom, you know, put it into effect.
B:	So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know a lot of people on death row.
A:	Okay, well,
A:	Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.
B:	Well, uh, yeah
A:	Texas is a big state,
B:	which is not very often.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, here in Maryland to the capital punishment law,
A:	people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one, no one has, actually has the sentence carried out.
A:	Uh, I'd certainly,
B:	What do they do, just keep them on death row for the rest of their life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, uh,
A:	or affair number
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,
A:	the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.
B:	Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?
A:	Uh, I don't know the exact numbers,
A:	but, but yes,
A:	prisons are overcrowded.
B:	I know that we have, you know,
B:	really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,
B:	and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,
B:	and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,
B:	and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,
B:	and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it
A:	Um.
B:	uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
A:	Okay,
A:	you're, you're certainly in the majority uh, at least in this country.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.
B:	I know they use it very, um,
B:	they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.
A:	No,
A:	at least not in Western Europe.
A:	Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.
A:	Um, there are many reasons for it,
A:	but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.
B:	Yes,
B:	you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.
A:	Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,
A:	arguably, if
A:	arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.
A:	Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.
B:	Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?
A:	Yes,
A:	oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.
A:	I, I, I,
A:	however the question is is that making the difference.
B:	Oh, I, I don't know.
B:	But we have a lot of welfare programs
B:	and
A:	Oh.
B:	if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,
B:	you know, or is it,
B:	in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.
A:	Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.
B:	Oh, do you?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	I would not have, I would not have said that.
B:	I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.
B:	That's an interesting theory.
B:	I'm not that familiar, you know,
B:	I've only been over there a couple of times
B:	and I'm not that familiar with, that,
A:	Me, too.
B:	all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, uh,
A:	Okay.
B:	Why don't you go ahead and start.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,
A:	and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy
A:	and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.
A:	And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, well, I have, in a for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life
B:	that seems to be the last thing I pick up,
B:	so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do subscribe
B:	I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine
A:	Uh-huh
B:	uh.
A:	you probably have smaller children younger children.
B:	Yes,
B:	yeah,
A:	My children, our children are grown
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
A:	and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
B:	Right,
B:	well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,
B:	so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.
B:	Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,
B:	so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed at this point in time.
A:	Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?
B:	I don't know,
B:	I, I, well,
B:	my husband would love to have more.
B:	Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines,
A:	Yes,
A:	now my husband does that,
A:	and
B:	Yeah,
A:	you know, and of course, uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	but I don't know,
A:	I know a few people leafing through them at the store
A:	but you just don't hear people talk about them,
A:	and I know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING,
A:	and I took them all
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what
A:	in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I haven't,
A:	I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
B:	Well
A:	even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,
B:	yeah,
B:	and some of those have had what, what I consider or what
B:	I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.
B:	They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.
A:	Oh, they are.
A:	My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she sends them to me,
A:	and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	Yes.
B:	Right
A:	you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know, then I can, I look through them
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I do,
A:	I just,
A:	what I do is I flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,
A:	they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine.
B:	Yes
B:	I enjoy books a lot more
A:	Yes
B:	that's true.
A:	and, uh.
B:	Well
A:	So, but.
B:	now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to,
B:	other than my children have gotten.
B:	You know, they get tons of magazines it seems
A:	Yes
B:	they're always getting something in the mail
B:	and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,
B:	and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,
B:	but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,
B:	unless you just want to skim through while you're,
B:	I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that.
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	I will read them in a doctor's office, too.
B:	Yeah,
A:	As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME,
A:	and, uh, and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,
A:	I'll glance through it.
A:	I like reading, uh, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.
A:	It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,
A:	I enjoy that.
A:	It's quick reading you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it doesn't require a lot of thinking,
A:	and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I don't want a lot of thinking
B:	That's true,
B:	that kind of is a good way to do it.
A:	It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.
A:	Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world
A:	so. Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh
B:	Okay.
A:	so, uh, I think that probably I will end the call.
A:	I've enjoyed,
A:	Okay.
A:	Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.
A:	I get most of my news information from T V.
A:	Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I find it one of the best.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, where do you get yours?
B:	Uh, mostly from T V too.
B:	I usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
B:	and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,
B:	but not very often do I read the whole thing.
B:	Quite often just scan through the headlines
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
A:	and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this
A:	and, uh I don't know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it,
A:	I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.
A:	It just seems like I was so busy all the time,
A:	and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, uh, things like that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so I
A:	and it got so depressing
B:	Yeah
A:	Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news
B:	Yeah.
B:	If there's something, you know, that I want to know more about or
B:	might be the Killeen murders.
B:	I've been kind of intrigued.
B:	I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone
B:	You just,
A:	Yes,
A:	yes.
A:	I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there
A:	I'll go through and read it.
A:	Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, uh, the T V you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, and they kind of capsize it and everything
B:	Yeah.
A:	and watch,
A:	and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	You know.
B:	I wanted a little more detail like, you know,
B:	they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.
B:	And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know
B:	and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.
B:	And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.
B:	Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to.
A:	Oh, the same type of church.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also
B:	so.
A:	Oh, uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So that was interesting,
B:	but I enjoy the news.
B:	I, I think our seven year old even once in a while will sit down and watch it with us,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so.
A:	I used to, uh,
A:	or I didn't used to
A:	but, uh
B:	No.
A:	when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought that was very interesting,
A:	and I thought that was very important for kids.
A:	Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that.
A:	The oldest one he's nine
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this
A:	been a couple of years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting.
A:	Actually I even understood it better
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yeah,
A:	you know. And, uh, but as I said, uh, I you know,
B:	Right.
A:	Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
B:	or,
A:	Yes.
A:	We like channel eight.
B:	Do you?
A:	We like it.
A:	It's the best.
B:	Um, channel five for some reason has always been the one I watch.
A:	Is that been your favorite?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I don't know
B:	it's probably the anchors.
B:	They just kind of catch you.
B:	I don't, I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I very
A:	and I thought it was very interesting, uh,
A:	channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and going on.
A:	They were having news coverage
A:	and,
B:	The C N N, is that what that is?
A:	No,
A:	it was channel nine.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so we had the T V on
A:	and we were trying to catch all of it,
A:	and they were showing some
A:	and I was watching,
A:	my husband and I were watching it,
A:	and then we switched over to channel eight,
A:	and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why they're kind of behind.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Did I say channel nine to begin with?
B:	Yeah
B:	That's why I wondered.
A:	No
A:	Okay.
A:	No, channel eleven I meant.
B:	I don't get that channel
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was thinking nine to ten.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But channel eleven,
B:	That is if you, if you want to go to bed early
B:	it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so.
A:	It, uh,
A:	but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight
A:	and they didn't
A:	Okay,
A:	would you, uh, like to begin or would you like me to start?
B:	Uh, oh, I can start.
A:	Okay.
B:	I, I think one of the, the biggest, uh, improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into, uh, management
A:	Yes.
B:	and you're seeing them, uh, get, uh, elected to, uh, political offices. Uh, not near enough.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management
A:	Yes,
A:	I agree.
B:	You're not seeing, you know,
B:	looking at T I, you see them in management, but you're not seeing them up there as V P
A:	Right.
B:	And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City,
B:	and I know the company that she was with, uh,
B:	the women didn't have near the positions, the levels that the men attorneys had. And were not, uh, given the same respect.
A:	Right.
A:	I agree with that.
A:	I, I think you do see more and more women out there in politics, too, as mayors or, uh, you know, in, in helping to maybe, uh, get some legislation passed to, to have women have more rights.
B:	Yes.
A:	I think still, even with that whole, um, thing with Judge Thomas and, and, uh, you, you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man
A:	or something the way they had the trial
A:	and uh, I just think that it's, it's still going to take another generation or so before, before the women really, could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh, but it's still, uh,
A:	going from, from homemakers into, uh, corporate leaders is still a big step.
B:	Right,
B:	I also think that, uh, uh, women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be.
B:	Used to be people would say, do you work, and you'd say, no, I work in the home
B:	and
A:	Right.
B:	it was, it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly, particularly even by women in the work force.
B:	But, I think now, I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very, very important.
A:	Yes.
B:	And it's getting the respect and, which is about time.
A:	I think it's true.
A:	I think also people are having children at a older age
B:	Yes,
B:	very definitely.
A:	so it's maybe like, uh, you know,
A:	you go through college
A:	and then you maybe work for a few years
A:	and then you have your first child
A:	and, uh, you know, you, you know both sides of the coin.
B:	That's right.
A:	You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.
A:	And, and then, uh, maybe people that are just working and think, oh, you just stay at home.
A:	But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like, they lose it
B:	Right.
A:	They say, wow!
A:	This is harder than I thought
B:	Yes
A:	Well, you know.
B:	And, and, to those that have never worked and had, you know, and have stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good
A:	I know it,
A:	I know.
B:	Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so, you know, it, it kind of does me good.
B:	I think also one of the things that, that's really tremendous and, it doesn't necessarily have to do with women, but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families.
A:	Are so involved.
A:	Yes.
B:	Which, again, I think it helps a woman's role.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	You know,
A:	Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us, too.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I know,
A:	I have three children
A:	and my oldest is eleven
A:	and I've pretty much been home, uh, since Brian was born
A:	and, uh, just recently I went back to work, uh, last school semester to tutor, uh, high school age students with learning disabilities
A:	and I was just out of the house two days a week
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, I thought, wow, this is really hard,
A:	only,
A:	and it was only two days
A:	and I was home before three.
A:	But getting the baby to day care, getting the kids off to school, I still did everything I always do, you know,
A:	my husband still got up and went to work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, it, it,
A:	only those two,
A:	it made a big difference.
A:	I thought, wow, full time,
A:	I don't think I could swing that personally.
B:	Well, I had to,
B:	course, I work full time,
B:	but my daughter and her husband were out of town
B:	so I had my grandchildren for four days during, uh, football, soccer season
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	and so I would work
B:	and her,
B:	some friends would take care of the kids,
B:	but I would have to get them picked up from there get them fed, get them to practices get homework done, get baths.
A:	Pick up. Dinner.
A:	Right.
B:	I was absolutely exhausted.
A:	I bet,
A:	I bet.
B:	And, and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.
A:	Well, I, I know a lot of people,
A:	I know I had my first child when I was twenty-five,
A:	and that's not considered really young these days,
A:	that's almost, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I have friends that, that have kids just starting kindergarten
A:	and they're, they're forty years old.
A:	And, and then like maybe a two year old at home,
A:	and I think, boy, I, I'm, I'm in my
A:	Okay,
A:	do we just go ahead?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Do you want to start?
A:	Uh, well, we're supposed to talk about vacations
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most
A:	and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii
B:	Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
B:	It's lovely, isn't it?
A:	Yes.
A:	We went, uh, six months after we were married.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we just went to, uh, two islands.
B:	What islands did you go to?
A:	We went to Oahu and Kauai.
B:	Kauai,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	We went to Kauai,
B:	and then we also hit Maui,
B:	and then, of course, uh
A:	The big one.
B:	uh, the big one,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It was.
B:	But the other two were just lovely.
A:	Yes,
A:	I enjoyed Kauai better, too.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.
B:	It wasn't commercialized.
A:	Oh, it was rainy
B:	Yeah
B:	was it?
A:	Rainy,
A:	but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
A:	so,
B:	That's right.
B:	Well, it wasn't real rainy.
B:	We had a few showers, but, uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
B:	and, and, when, uh,
B:	now we went to Nassau
B:	and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	he really did.
B:	I don't know why.
B:	You know, he didn't like Oahu at all
B:	He thought
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Did you go there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That was wonderful
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we both enjoyed it very much.
A:	That was That was nice,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, I've been to Nassau, too.
B:	Have you?
A:	I went on a cruise.
B:	Oh, neat.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, our son and daughter-in-law just, uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.
B:	And I know they didn't like it.
B:	Now, we have several friends that, uh, have been on, and just love them.
B:	But James and I like,
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.
A:	Well, I, got sick.
B:	Oh, did you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I did the first night.
A:	I went with my sister just, uh, a couple years ago
B:	Ooh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner.
B:	Um.
A:	It was bad,
A:	but, and then after that it was, it got better,
A:	but we just,
A:	it was a four day
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we were both ready to get off the boat.
B:	Were you?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.
B:	Now we've been real lucky.
B:	We've been to Europe twice.
A:	Oh, have you?
B:	Yeah.
B:	We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland
B:	And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.
A:	Oh.
B:	It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains
A:	Wow.
A:	I'll bet it is.
B:	and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started
B:	and it was wonderful.
B:	It, uh it was just, it was marvelous.
A:	Oh.
B:	And we would love to go back there
B:	and we'd love to go back to London.
A:	You haven't been to Spain?
B:	No
A:	Oh.
B:	have not been to Spain.
A:	I was born there.
B:	Were you?
A:	Yes
B:	How old were you when you left?
A:	Uh, just ten months.
B:	Oh, ten months,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so,
B:	Have you ever got to go back?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	and I would like to.
B:	Would you?
B:	My, uh, my sister,
B:	we went with them to Germany
B:	and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.
B:	I'm not sure whether I would like to or not.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.
A:	Would you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems.
B:	Well, the
B:	there is
B:	uh-huh,
B:	is, is a little scary,
B:	but I would still like to see it.
B:	I'd like to see, uh, Italy.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I would love to go there.
A:	That would be nice.
B:	And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.
A:	Now, have you been to Yellowstone?
B:	Uh,
A:	Yellowstone,
B:	Yes,
B:	yes.
A:	Have you?
B:	We have been there.
B:	We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they loved it.
A:	Well,
B:	I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, it's at
B:	Yeah.
A:	my husband works in Salt Lake,
A:	so
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	we're real close
A:	and, yeah,
A:	we,
B:	Now that's a pretty city.
A:	Yes,
A:	we, we like it.
B:	Very clean. You know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It is.
B:	Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.
A:	Well, we kind of like it
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?
B:	We,
B:	no,
B:	we used to
B:	We used to camp a lot with our
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, you like the motels?
B:	We like the motels,
B:	yes
A:	Oh, oh, well.
B:	We have, we've gone past the camping stage.
B:	We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.
A:	Oh, did you?
B:	And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys
B:	and it was beautiful
B:	and our kids loved it and everything
B:	and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, it's hot down here
B:	and camping is not near as much fun.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. And, uh, although our son loves to fish
A:	Huh.
B:	and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So I've been concerned about crime lately.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood?
B:	Well, I, I think we have a neighborhood watch
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think.
B:	I'm not real,
B:	we don't get real involved.
B:	We're never home,
B:	so
A:	Uh-huh
B:	uh, uh, well, I know they were going to start one,
B:	but, uh, I haven't heard any more since,
B:	so I don't really know.
B:	But as far as personally doing something, no.
A:	No, um.
B:	How about you?
A:	Well we moved in, when we moved in, there, there wasn't any outside lights
A:	and so we've been trying to install some, uh, outside lights
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we put up a fence in the backyard.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Mostly, you know, not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in, but that our children would be safe playing in the yard. You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids. To let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
B:	Oh, I'm sure it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and, say, call me before you leave and come back
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and,
B:	We don't have any.
B:	We did install a, a a, uh, motion detector light back in our driveway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that was, mainly it was so when we pulled up, the light would come on,
B:	but also we have a boat back there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief,
B:	so
B:	we thought with that light, you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat
B:	Yeah
B:	so,
A:	Well, we've been real lucky that,
A:	I don't believe there's been, you know, much trouble in our neighborhood,
A:	but it  but it does seem there, that there is a lot more here in Plano of, uh, just bored teenagers
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's
A:	Vandalism.
B:	what it is.
B:	We live in, Coppell
B:	and, and that's pretty much what it is, is you know, kids that are bored, like you say.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they don't, uh,
A:	I know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and a few things like that
B:	Oh, no.
A:	and, course, you know,
A:	I don't know
A:	I'm getting scared for kids to get older,
A:	because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who, and, or is it just random crime,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the, anywhere that they live has had, been a victim of, you know, a serious crime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, But, I guess I take a lot of, uh, little bit of, uh, safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, like drug related or uh, things that,
B:	Uh-huh,
A:	places usually that I wouldn't be going. And things I usually wouldn't be involved in.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it is scary.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
A:	Were you raised in this area?
B:	Really is
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm originally from Chicago, but I've been in this area, in the Lewisville area for, uh, let's see, about twenty-three years.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, has it been getting worse that you noticed, or  about the same?
B:	Oh  definitely.
A:	Um.
B:	In the last few years, I think,
B:	and, uh, like I say,
B:	now I don't think necessarily in this area here, but just Dallas in general.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know,
B:	I think back of when I was, uh, younger and in my party days, some of the things I did, you know, I wouldn't be caught dead, like, being out that late at night.
A:	Right.
B:	In the dark parking lot
A:	Right.
A:	Take a lot of chances.
A:	Well, I noticed that, uh, that, uh, when
A:	we, we moved here from Houston not too long ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, of course, we were interested in schools
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, but the schools in Houston all have big, tall fences around them
A:	and they're not really very safe
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them,
A:	and it's just a whole different idea that, that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school.
B:	Huh.
A:	And so that's been something that's been good for the, you know, in this area that you feel like, uh, you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I guess,
A:	I don't know how people live with that every day.
B:	Um.
B:	I don't either.
A:	Pretty scary.
B:	Yeah, um.
A:	But, anyway, well, I guess I won't take up more of your
A:	Well, I am new to Texas,
A:	so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,
B:	Uh-huh?
A:	do you?
B:	Well, yes,
B:	of course, we do have capital punishment.
B:	And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.
A:	Oh, that's right,
A:	I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.
B:	Yes.
A:	Um, you know, different things,
A:	is it restricted to certain crimes?
A:	Or just,
B:	Yes,
B:	it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um. Well.
B:	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
A:	Yes,
A:	I know,
A:	the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent
A:	and, they want,
A:	I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
A:	I just,
A:	I can't see that.
B:	That happens on occasion,
B:	it sure does,
B:	maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, I don't know,
B:	or a person personally.
A:	No.
B:	I think I would be, you know,
B:	I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,
B:	I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.
B:	I don't know that it is.
B:	I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
A:	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	oh, absolutely,
B:	yeah,
B:	it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
A:	it's really sad.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I just think, um,
A:	somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it
B:	Yes.
A:	with,
A:	someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.
A:	Is really kind of bad
B:	Yes
B:	it is.
B:	It's a tough, tough question.
B:	It really is.
B:	I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
B:	Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
B:	Oh, absolutely.
B:	that's right.
A:	Oh, I don't know,
A:	is it,
A:	do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
B:	Not with me personally.
B:	It is with a lot of other people.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not, not to me personally,
B:	no.
A:	Um.
B:	No.
A:	I don't know,
A:	sometimes I feel,
A:	I mean I do go to church and things.
A:	I don't know how I would feel about it.
A:	But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
B:	That's a, it's a tough, tough question,
B:	it really is.
A:	Do you think most states have that
B:	I'm, uh, member of the American Meteorological Society,
B:	and
A:	Are you
A:	you didn't work at T I?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	But I'm, uh, I, I did that in my .
A:	Where do you work in research,
A:	or
B:	No, I'm a planner, a production planner.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	But I, I, I'm in the active reserves as a weatherman,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh, I, I keep up from time to time,
B:	but what the, the argument is that, uh, that, uh, maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is.
B:	But, um, if there is, uh, we probably could do something about it now,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and if there isn't, if there isn't and we do some the right things, I think,
B:	how do you feel about, about all this smog and stuff on cars.
A:	Uh, well, I'm kind of a car buff myself,
A:	I was going to ask you another question,
A:	but, uh, I'll do that in a minute.
A:	I, I think that the changing, you know, from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage, you know, not using ...
B:	Well, do you have an older car?
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	no.
B:	I, I have been working on an older car
B:	but it
B:	yeah.
A:	Really?
A:	Oh, I'm a car buff too,
A:	we ought to talk about that one day, uh, uh,
B:	Well, I'm restoring one.
A:	I think you can use the, you can use high, you know, the ninety-two percent, uh, ninety-two octane I don't think you'll have any trouble.
B:	I'm not having any problem it's a seventy.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And the.
A:	No,
A:	I, I think, uh,
A:	I, uh, work on my own cars
A:	and, uh, I don't think that's a problem.
A:	I thought,
A:	I'm saying, I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline,
A:	'n.
B:	But did you have another
B:	you said you had another
A:	Uh, oh,
A:	the same thing about the war, uh, or related to the war on,
A:	I was watching C N N
A:	and I cannot remember what station it was,
A:	what,
A:	did you see the advertisements, uh, where they talked about nuclear war, what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere,
A:	it is so scary that I hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster, you know.
B:	Uh,
A:	Did you see any of those, uh, I,
A:	it was,
B:	No,
B:	I didn't see that , that,
B:	I know that the, uh,
B:	that's ...
A:	It must have been channel thirteen,
A:	I don't recall,
A:	although, I thought it was on C N N, oh,
A:	I,
B:	Well, that,
B:	they called nuclear winner
B:	and, and I suppose that's, that's the ultimate, uh, pollution problem.
A:	It was a somewhat of a commercial because it I saw it regularly
A:	and it showed that
A:	and it was really devastating
A:	and, it would, uh ,
B:	Well it,
A:	how much ash would fall
A:	and, and how it would essentially literally destroy the world, you know.
B:	Well, the Chernobyl accident, uh,
B:	actually, um, because the circulation budget as high as it went, uh, covered, uh, a fairly remarkable amount
B:	they did some tracers
B:	and they
B:	I, I think it's drawn in, uh,
B:	I think, gets in there
B:	I can't think of the other trace,
B:	but I saw a, a presentation on, on that
B:	and they,
B:	it went quite a long ways but I, I, I guess I can be a little sympathetic
B:	but, you know, there's some argument that in, in, in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that's the, uh, the pine trees giving off pollution
B:	and,
A:	Oh, really,
A:	yeah,
A:	there, there's probably a lot of natural things, uh,
B:	But the,
B:	but when you when you get up in the morning in, in Dallas and, and see all that haze from west Texas, is that, is that pollution?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, it,
A:	I guess it's got to be really,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I don't know if it's air pollution it's, uh, it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not I don't know.
B:	Well, it,
B:	that's the thing is that I think, I think Dallas really does have a problem in this,
B:	the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel, burning fuel,
B:	the problem is, is it's like Los Angeles.
B:	People don't, people don't want to use mass transit,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	well, I live in Arlington
A:	and there, there, there are no buses.
A:	I mean, there, there is,
A:	the only school bus, the only buses you see are school buses,
A:	so.
B:	But who wants to, who wants to, um, ride a bus?
A:	Well, I know it, it's, uh, you know,
A:	the car is,
A:	we have this big romance with the car,
A:	but, uh, I think people are, would be interested if you had one, I mean.
B:	Well, my boss drives forty miles one way each day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And one of the guys that works with me drives forty-five miles.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and they don't think it,
B:	well, I guess they do think something of it
B:	but, um, not even to, you know,
B:	you consider how much, um,
B:	but then you get into all these issues of, of whether it, it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs
B:	and, are we going to die of, of respiratory,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, we all move out of the, out of downtown
B:	so we get away from the, the smog.
B:	My, my wife grew up in southern California
B:	and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles, uh, when the valley was clean.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And now the valley is not
B:	and so people move out one more valley and, General Motors apparently has one that they're, they're testing,
A:	Well, you said you were car buff, uh,
A:	I think that, uh, all of us could use one electric car right now, I mean, today, because I think, uh, you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever,
A:	yeah,
A:	when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car
A:	but I think we all could, in a family, say, have an electric car where my, one of my daughters or my wife, my wife, she could use one now if they had one, you know, because they, she don't even, she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car.
B:	I think it's, no, it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing .
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	you're right.
A:	I, I have seen them
A:	but, uh, they have a battery car.
B:	But they suppose,
A:	Uh, I went to the auto show this past week
A:	and they did not endorse,
A:	now that I think of it,
A:	and I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to ask anybody,
A:	there were no electric cars.
A:	I was surprised
A:	but now that you just mentioned that.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, the ROAD and TRACK was talking about that this, apparently General Motors has some, uh,
B:	they apparently think they're close.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think, uh, there could be a lot of
A:	I
A:	people close this is really,
A:	we're, we're nine years away or less, I guess, from the next century and I think,
B:	Well, there's still a lot of research,
B:	I was over in, in the research lab a couple, I guess, it's been about a month ago
B:	and saw this, research it was a little light that says solar, solar powered research.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they've got a, they've got a area over in, the S M building too which is, uh,
A:	but it's a solar, uh,
A:	it's for, uh,
A:	gots some money from a power company
A:	and it's probably more generating power for, you know, uh, electricity, a hundred and twenty volt or whatever.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, do you work in that C building?
A:	No,
A:	I'm actually in the south building
A:	but, uh,
B:	Oh, I'm at ,
A:	I was, uh, I'm the facility
A:	so I've been in all, most of the buildings anyway.
B:	Oh, well, I'm in, I'm in the C building,
B:	been there for, all my life.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	well, the, the solar area is right, right around from the auditorium now.
A:	And it,
A:	they've got several different, uh, areas where they're called solar lab.
A:	It's, right there on the first floor you look, walk by there.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, that's been a
B:	I know the focal plain array is they were taking space to, a long time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but the solar project, you know, T I's been into it for years,
A:	and I guess it's just not, uh, economical yet because of the other fuels.
B:	Well, the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon, you know, who wants to,
B:	yeah,
B:	I mean, we want to not pollute,
B:	but, uh, at a dollar a gallon, uh, it's hard to beat, the amount of energy you get from, uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've seen some.
A:	I think
A:	then again I'm surprised now I didn't think they'd asked anybody when I was in the auto show.
A:	There was nothing, uh,
A:	and there was no, place for air pollution or companies or anyone there.
A:	It was just pure automobiles.
B:	Well, I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol,
A:	There?
B:	they had one with spots on it and something.
A:	Huh.
B:	I didn't go
B:	but
B:	it was showing they,
B:	I mean, uh,
A:	I didn't see,
B:	an article.
A:	did you go?
B:	No,
B:	I didn't,
A:	Oh.
B:	I didn't go,
B:	so. I
A:	Uh, I was, uh, quite impressed with all the cars, you know,
A:	the engines are so much smaller now and everything
A:	and they're, they all have brand new engines, even General Motors, uh,
A:	very few
A:	only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight, uh, the old V-eights,
A:	they're all brand new engines,
A:	uh, of course, they're burning gasoline, of course.
B:	They've done a lot.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, whether, you know,
A:	that's one way, you know, uh, uh,
A:	on air pollution I, I, I don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really.
A:	They've got catalytic converters,
A:	everyone seem to have gone to that, whether they last, uh, and do a good job
A:	and now that they, the inspection systems are analyzing that, uh,
A:	well, what do you think if you're in that, you know, if you're concerned about that,
B:	Well,
A:	I mean, if you're, you're, you're knowledgeable on that.
B:	Well, they, uh,
B:	it's interesting though because my cars are older
B:	and so I didn't have to,
B:	if you live in Dallas County you have to have your, have to have it checked
B:	and it's ,
B:	I had a friend with a Fiero that, uh, they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned
B:	and, so, apparently ...
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, I just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting,
B:	and then we had this whole can, uh, a bag filled full of cans
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they've been recycling at their school.
B:	Well, she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they were filled with beer cans
A:	Hm
B:	and I hated to take a big old sack, I mean, one time, I mean, like a lawn bag full of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like I,
B:	no,
B:	we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans,
B:	and I think that's all.
A:	Oh.
B:	speaking in the Okay,
B:	and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees.
A:	Oh, that's a good idea.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and they've got their bins that stay there,
B:	and they've decorated real cute, you know, with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they're getting into it.
B:	I don't know what they get for the tickets, though.
B:	to someone off the What do you get for the tickets, if you bring stuff?
B:	Oh, the class that gets the most tickets gets a party
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	It's not bad, yeah.
A:	Um, I know,
A:	we to someone off um, we, we are kind of getting into recycling now.
A:	I'm in college,
A:	and I live in a dorm,
A:	and we recycle paper.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know that there's a glass plant up here,
A:	and they recycle glass,
A:	and, you know, we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff.
B:	So in each of the dorms you have a place for that?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's really good.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then when our dorm,
A:	whenever our bins are all filled up, we take them and turn them in,
A:	and then we get money for that.
B:	For the dorm,
B:	and who decides what you do with it?
A:	Yeah,
A:	we just put, you know, we just keep it with the dorm.
B:	And what do they do with it?
A:	Well, we buy things for the dorm, whatever the dorm needs, you know.
A:	Like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things,
A:	and then we buy, like, cooking equipment and stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Or we play games, like board games.
A:	We buy board games.
A:	You know, it's just different things, whatever, you know,
A:	we vote on it,
A:	and whatever the dorm would want, that's what we buy.
B:	Well, I graduated from college in nineteen seventy-two,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we were just, um, not aware that this was a problem, that we ever would need to recycle.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Of course, you just threw it away.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, a little different.
B:	And I wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target, to recycle.
B:	I had my school do it,
B:	but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield, we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that
A:	Yeah.
B:	The whole school, you know,
B:	it was just this big project,
B:	she didn't want to get into that.
B:	And I could do it in the center,
B:	and I just never got around to it.
B:	But, it's like a club,
B:	you know about that?
A:	No.
B:	A little boy that had died of leukemia, I think,
B:	and he had started this, um, save the environment club.
A:	Oh.
B:	And his mother is carrying this on.
B:	And you can get the information to set it up, you know and join,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you don't have to join it as a group or anything, I don't guess.
A:	Oh, that'd be
B:	But you could start your own anyway.
B:	Get a pamphlet,
A:	Is that what this target is,
A:	what you're,
B:	Do you all have Target stores up there?
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	That's a department store.
A:	Oh.
B:	Kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
A:	I would like,
A:	let's start up a Target.
A:	No.
A:	Um, I don't really know any other recycling that they do.
B:	So, you're not you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything.
A:	No.
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
A:	We have to take it to a recycling place.
B:	Huh.
B:	Now in some of the towns around us, they're already picking up the newspapers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they're doing that here, too, now that I think about it voice in Once every so many weeks,
B:	and you have to pull out all the slicks,
B:	and you have to wrap them up with string.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, I think that's all they're picking up.
B:	But you know, like in Minnesota, they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles.
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because my brother-in-law lives in Minnesota,
B:	and they're are just nice, plastic bins,
B:	and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash,
B:	and they pick them up.
A:	Um. I never heard of that in
B:	Do you all have can banks?
A:	Um, not that I know of
B:	No?
A:	No.
B:	in I
B:	a big old bin,
B:	and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot,
B:	and your money comes out, you know, every once in a while, for however much poundage you've got.
B:	And if you keep feeding it until the light goes off. And you get instant cash.
A:	Oh my gosh.
B:	But they had one that I was putting my stuff in,
B:	and I went to take some today,
B:	and it was gone.
A:	Um.
B:	I don't know.
B:	But I located another one today on the way to work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, we have places where we go
A:	and we, what we do is we unload our cans.
A:	It's like a conveyor belt,
A:	and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it.
A:	And then they weigh, uh, your aluminum cans,
A:	and then you get money for your aluminum cans.
B:	But they don't give you for the other.
A:	No.
A:	But now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones, too.
A:	Before, they didn't.
A:	But I know they're going to start now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well they're certain places, you know, where down there you can take your leaded cans.
B:	But I don't know where they are.
B:	They publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know.
B:	I'm trying
B:	but, I just can't recycle everything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah
B:	I'm not that dedicated.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But.
A:	Well, that's all I really know about recycling.
B:	Me, too.
B:	If they would.
B:	Oh, I know, we're saving our grocery bags now.
A:	Oh really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're taking those up.
B:	You can take them to the stores
B:	Um, like Kroger's doing it.
B:	And I think Skaggs.
B:	Do you have those up there?
A:	We have Kroger, but not a Skaggs.
B:	And we,
B:	they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there, too.
A:	Oh.
B:	So.
A:	Uh.
B:	That's pretty good isn't it.
A:	You guys are getting into it more than we are.
B:	It sounds like it,
B:	you'd think you would be.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh-uh,
A:	I've never seen any, you know, places that do.
A:	I know, um, we reuse our grocery bags now.
A:	We take them back, you know, and use the ones that we have.
A:	You can like,
A:	if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones.
B:	You mean where you sack your own groceries.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags.
B:	Huh.
B:	And I don't want to go with those canvas bags right now, I'm sorry.
B:	I'm not that European
B:	But you know, they do that like,
B:	I went to Europe, nineteen seventy-three.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, they go all the time.
B:	It's like they would go almost every day to the store.
B:	And they had their little bags way back then, and fill it up.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	That's why.
B:	They couldn't put anything in it hardly.
B:	But,
A:	Uh.
B:	Well, what are you going to do when you get out of college?
A:	I'm a finance major.
B:	Well, that's why I did what I did.
B:	I went into teaching
B:	Here in Texas it's a real mess right now.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Oh definitely.
B:	There's no.
B:	Let's see,
B:	we've had the funding,
B:	we've run out of money.
B:	We've frozen the money.
B:	Right?
B:	And they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances, because the poor districts were getting less money, so not as good an education.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right?
B:	And now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts, like the one that I'm in, in Dallas, and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable.
B:	And if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth, then the state's supposed to decide, the courts.
A:	What do you think the outcome will be?
B:	I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax.
B:	Do you have one?
A:	Yeah
B:	I'm not looking forward to it,
B:	but something's got to be done.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	we've had one as long as I can remember
B:	Well, it's going to hit us.
A:	Yeah
B:	And I don't know,
B:	doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it.
B:	But maybe,
B:	I know we're not using it so wisely.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have too many administrators in some of these big districts.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But other than that. Well, can you think of anything else we need to talk about.
A:	Um, I can't think of anything on recycling.
B:	Me, either.
B:	Anything else?
A:	No.
B:	What about people from, um, Pennsylvania.
B:	What do they think about Texans?
A:	What do we think about them?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I don't know
B:	Have you thought about that?
A:	No,
A:	I never really thought about it
A:	what you think about Pennsylvanians.
B:	Probably a lot more civilized, more, um, refined than a lot of the people would be down here.
A:	Oh really
B:	I would hope so,
B:	I mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I really don't know anyone from Texas or anything.
B:	No.
A:	I've never been there, um.
B:	Well I've never,
B:	well let's see,
B:	I think I have too been to Pennsylvania.
B:	Gettysburg?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we went up there. Now that I think about it. On one of our long trips we take off on.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Oh, well
B:	Shboom.
B:	child in What are you saying, Holly?
B:	talking to Oh, my little girl is in the second grade, told me to tell you that Shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language.
A:	Oh.
B:	child in is what you say it is, Holly? In Israel, in Israel.
B:	on See she's got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she's befriended.
A:	Oh.
B:	So she's into this.
A:	Oh, is it like a foreign exchange type student?
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	You know we've had a lot of the Jewish people ...
B:	Colorado Springs.
A:	Oh, right,
A:	up in, uh, T I out there?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, right
B:	Did you hit one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I just hit one then.
B:	All right.
A:	Uh,
B:	The savings and loan scandal.
A:	It,
A:	I, got to, uh,
A:	this is going to be fun.
A:	Are you Republican or Democrat?
B:	Uh, kind of neither.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I'm a, I'm a Democrat
A:	so I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time.
B:	I do have some Republican leanings, because, I am division one, you know
A:	Well, I, uh,
A:	to answer that one before we get to our subject, you know, I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money
A:	and they're the ones wasting all the money.
A:	And, I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want, you know.
A:	I get a kick out of that.
A:	But, anyway, the subject, go ahead.
A:	You first.
B:	Uh, I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, I don't think it's over.
A:	I think that, uh, so many other things have taken over, uh, in the media.
A:	But, I think it was just plain greed,
A:	and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks.
A:	Go ahead loan your money out, you know.
B:	I agree with you.
B:	I think it had something to do with deregulation,
B:	but I believe, uh, more of it was just greed.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I was talking to someone,
A:	I can't remember who it was,
A:	but he was a small businessman,
A:	and he said that the banks were calling,
A:	he borrowed some money
A:	and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away.
A:	They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property
A:	and, uh, yeah,
A:	there, there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned.
B:	Well,
A:	Not just a couple.
B:	You know, we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times, you know,
A:	Right.
B:	and the list goes on and on.  You know, of, of just the crimes committed. Much less for criminals that should be indicted.
A:	Well I, I agree a hundred percent.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It may have started with HUD too.
A:	I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape
A:	and that was property
A:	and, uh, they lost a lot of money there,
A:	and then some of these big, these rich people started to,
A:	even Murchison here, who owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida.
A:	This was several years ago
A:	and he lost, you know, all, all of his money before he died.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Not all of it,
A:	I don't know how much he lost,
A:	but, uh, they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit
A:	and it always would, it always would increase, you know,
A:	it always would, uh, uh, be more than what you paid for it
A:	and they just never even got conservative with our money at all.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It,
B:	everyone forgets whose money it was.
A:	Right.
B:	And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I,
B:	as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action.
A:	Well now the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, uh, Reaganomics for, you know,
A:	you spend your way to prosperity
A:	and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, well, that was the philosophy, you know.
A:	Just keep spending until taxes are lower,
A:	and, I thought, that's not going to work, you know,
A:	and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally.
B:	Well,
A:	And, it hasn't worked now.
B:	In theory, in theory, a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on.
A:	Right,
A:	no doubt,
A:	no doubt.
B:	And, if people are making money, people can spend money,
B:	and it'll generate taxes.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I, I, I agree with that,
A:	but there's got to be some control
A:	and apparently there was, you know,
B:	Well, the problem is,
B:	and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, for what they would cost
B:	and we weren't producing anything.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We, as Americans weren't producing anything.
B:	It was all inflation.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it,
B:	we agree too closely,
B:	but,  But, you, you can't say that that was right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know, uh,
A:	Oh, no,
A:	I,
B:	No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich.
A:	Right.
B:	Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.
A:	And, and not high quality ones at that, you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well,
A:	Well, I do have a lot of confidence in the, the American people and the economy and everything else.
A:	I, I feel bad when I see the inefficiency, even here at T I, you know,
A:	and I think that the,
A:	it, it still,
A:	a lot of the workers don't understand that, uh, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know.
B:	It is a life and death struggle, with with the Japanese.
A:	Right.
A:	I know,
A:	and I, when I,
A:	of course I'm in facilities,
A:	and I work with a lot of mechanics
A:	and I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce, you know,
A:	and they think that, well, I'm paid anyway
A:	so it doesn't matter, you know.
B:	I, I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, and I'm nonexempt.
A:	Yeah,
A:	oh, really?
A:	You don't sound like a nonexempt, Jim.
B:	What?
A:	You don't sound like a nonexempt.
B:	What, what does a nonexempt sound like?
A:	Uh, you're too informed.
A:	They're, they're very, they're very, uh, not interested.
A:	They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now.
B:	Uh,
A:	I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here.
A:	I don't know really.
B:	Uh, that's,
A:	I'm being a Yankee, I guess I'm, I'm letting my Yankee come out, you know.
B:	Well, I,
B:	now maybe I'm not the, uh, typical nonexempt that you deal with.
B:	The badge is silver.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I am degreed, though nonexempt.
A:	Uh, well that's good.
B:	No
B:	That's not good
B:	but,
A:	No,
A:	right,
A:	I mean, that's good that you're degreed,
A:	uh, uh, your time will come.
A:	We, uh,
A:	I know a few people,
B:	No,
B:	I, I do not wish my time to come.
A:	Oh, really,
A:	what,
A:	are you in a tech,
A:	like do you do technician work or something?
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no,
B:	no.
B:	I,
B:	government tool control is my specialty now.
B:	I did P C protection control work for, uh, About ten or twelve years, uh,
A:	Oh quality, okay.
B:	right now I'm just trying to tool crib and chips.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Times are bad.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, now, is, is, uh, really terrible.
A:	I'm, uh, management level uh, facilities,
A:	and when the cuts came, three of us got, uh, bounced back,
A:	and so we're just, uh,
A:	I'm calling you from work.
A:	I'm, I'm covering, uh, weekends and nights now.
A:	I'm, I'm one of the manager reps,
A:	there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities
A:	and just we're essentially standby and problems, uh, all, all nights and weekends.
A:	That's my,
A:	I only get one weekend off a month right now.
A:	I call it my recession job.
B:	It's,
A:	Uh, being basically an engineer and liking, uh, doing installation work, well there's not any.
A:	I mean there is literally is no installation work going on.
B:	They turned all installation up here off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They told facilities they could not work.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't care what the jobs are, you will not work.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it,
B:	And, and, as far as our, you know, our conversation goes, I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to, the banking structure.
A:	Banking?
A:	I think that, not, not only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, uh,
A:	there was one point I was going to make.
A:	I think the last I heard,
A:	and I, I have to admit I'm not as informed as them,
A:	but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit.
A:	Well, I always double that.
A:	I figure well, if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes
A:	and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was, that went down the tube somewhere.
B:	Uh, it really hurts me, to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's amazing really.
A:	It's amazing that,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I know what you mean.
B:	Uh, one of our senior,
A:	Course your value of homes up there are pretty good.
A:	I mean, here they're not really that high,
A:	but are they pretty good up there?
B:	No.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart.
A:	Well we're in the metroplex here, you know,
A:	and, uh, it, it,
B:	Right.
A:	I die every time companies like General Dynamics,
A:	they, they lost several contracts
A:	and, and, I don't know if you noticed yesterday, you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter, you know,
A:	they were going to have big, uh, award,
A:	and Secorski got it. Which was Boeing Secorski, this which is up in the north somewhere, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's northwest.
A:	And, I don't know how,   Bell didn't get it.
B:	Seattle.
B:	Seattle,
B:	and also, uh, they do some of that in Wichita, Kansas.
A:	Well, I, I don't,
A:	they were advertising here that it was Bell, T I.
A:	T I was getting the, uh, electronics with Bell,
A:	and so, it was a double.
A:	One that Bell is in the Metroplex
A:	and two, that T I was doing the electronics for them.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, they, they advertised that, that it was T I Bell, T I Bell and then all of a sudden, Secorski got it, yeah.
B:	Secorski Boeing.
A:	Secorski, Boeing,
A:	Boeing doesn't need the money.
A:	Something,
A:	I almost think there's some politics around here, because the metroplex here, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area, the, uh, with T I,
A:	I don't know if T I has lost as much as everybody else,
A:	but General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after project, you know.
B:	Well, you realize ...
B:	There you go.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials
B:	and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now my personal opinion,
B:	I don't know.
B:	Uh, uh, here lately it seems,
B:	well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh,
B:	they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's just not right.
A:	I think I agree with that very much.
B:	And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.
A:	I,
A:	do you,
A:	Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that,
A:	and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?
B:	Yes,
B:	very possibly.
B:	So many of us have led sheltered lives that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've never done it myself unfortunately,
A:	I never have either.
B:	I wish I could have.
B:	I've just never been called up.
A:	My husband works as a police man,
A:	so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.
B:	Well now, that's possible.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once,
B:	but I never made it to the jury.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?
B:	Not that I know of.
A:	Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury,
A:	and I had never heard of such thing,
A:	and I wondered if it was true.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Uh, I've never heard of it.
A:	I never had either,
A:	but I just wondered. Uh,
A:	another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision,
A:	and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.
B:	Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.
A:	That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Is it guilt or innocence.
B:	But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,
B:	and, and it permits the criminal to get a retrial.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And there,
B:	that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Bring some of these things out.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.
A:	Un, apparently there are.
A:	I, I, I,
A:	since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.
A:	Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.
B:	Oh, that's it,
B:	and you just might resemble somebody.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.
B:	It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We had,
B:	a Black man was accused simply because he resembled uh, someone who who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was.
A:	Oh. Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work,
B:	and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,
A:	They still found him guilty?
B:	They found him guilty.
A:	When people said he was at work?
B:	Well, they said it this, this happened during lunch time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But after nine years,
B:	well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.
A:	Oh, for heaven's sake.
A:	So there's nine years of that man's life gone.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now that just was not fair.
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,
A:	we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.
B:	Unfortunately, that's what happens.
B:	Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,
B:	but it's the best one in the world.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's the best one that exists, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,
B:	and they try to solve them and everything,
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	the Supreme Court,
B:	well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.
A:	Oh, I think a lot of people are.
A:	I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.
B:	Well, it,
B:	the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me
B:	no,
B:	I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would.
A:	That bad, huh.
A:	I wouldn't like it,
A:	but I don't know if I'd go that far.
B:	Well, I happen to be a flag freak.
B:	I served, I was in the service
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I was in Korea
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.
A:	It's important in so many facets of our lives.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.
B:	Yeah,
B:	see what they,
A:	There's nobody holding them here.
B:	See how they'd like it under another flag.
A:	Right.
A:	They'd soon be back,
A:	I'm sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I hope they get something out of this.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's,
A:	do you think that's good you know, like if a jury,
B:	Oh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I think the jury should be able to recommend,
A:	Make a recommendation?
B:	Yes.
A:	Do they sometimes make a recommendation?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	yes.
A:	That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.
B:	I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.
B:	But I know I'm always hearing that, uh,
B:	well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict
B:	and they recommended,  twenty years or something.
A:	And they recommend.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen. Yeah.
B:	Yes.
B:	Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.
A:	Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,
A:	but actually, their chance, course, when,
A:	a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.
A:	It depends on you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.
A:	And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.
B:	Yes.
B:	They just go out and repeat their crimes.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Well there,
B:	well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,
B:	but I think they ought to make it two offenses.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I always thought there was, there was wrong,
A:	it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good,
A:	the balance isn't right.
A:	It doesn't make sense.
B:	Yeah,
B:	very true.
B:	Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Race or nationality even.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,
B:	but it's the best one we've got.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	So, let's put up with it, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.
B:	Sure enough.
A:	So.
B:	Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.
A:	Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack,
A:	and I hope you have a real good day and week.
B:	Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.
A:	I hope not.
B:	Take care now.
A:	You, too.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Where, where are you from?
B:	Um, just here in Dallas.
A:	Oh, okay
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because I, uh, I talked to a professor in, uh, what was it, North Carolina, who got the, the T I system,
A:	and he gave to all his students.
A:	So, my daughter's even talked to,
A:	and I've talked to several people from North Carolina.
A:	I was just curious.
B:	That's,
B:	yes,
B:	yes,
B:	that's true.
B:	I've  talked,
A:	Have you,  too?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	People from Virginia and, and all over. Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I talked to the professor,
A:	and I asked him about it,
A:	and he said, Oh, he says, I think I'm the guy that, actually, uh, gave it to all my students.
A:	So that's why so many people are from this college.
A:	Go,  ahead,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you, you first, Eve .
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Um, well the subject we're supposed to be talking about, let's see, is, uh, food.
A:	Food.
B:	What type of foods do you cook
B:	and what would you, uh, cook in, uh, uh, let's see, if you were giving a dinner party?
B:	And the only reason why I may know a little bit about this, is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, um, uh, cooking for people.
B:	And, uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, uh, you don't have to do all that much work. You know, you just, uh, slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We have them too,
A:	and I, I'm trying to think which is the, best, uh, that I prefer.
A:	Uh, my wife, uh, doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it, uh,
A:	and we haven't catered out very much, uh,
A:	we, I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be,
A:	the man always gets that chore,
A:	and you, have to make it perfect.
A:	Uh, I've made shish kabob, which I like.
A:	It's fairly easy and fast.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
A:	I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for, for having, uh, uh, dinner.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I do cook,
A:	but not,
A:	I'm mostly the easy cooker.
A:	You know, the breakfasts and,  and the steaks, uh.
B:	Yes.
A:	Although I would like to experiment with, uh, the meals my mother made, you know. So to speak,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I haven't gotten around to that yet, uh,
B:	What kind of meals did she make that you liked?
A:	Well, she was Polish
A:	and, uh, she would make very economical meals.
A:	We were very poor.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Different rice and ham and things that, uh,
A:	she would throw things together and galunkies and all that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, I would like to try that one day.
A:	And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and, and special meat balls and everything.
A:	And my wife, of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too
B:	Huh.
A:	but,
B:	No.
B:	Sounds interesting, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's great.
A:	But dinner parties are a lot of work, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	But, uh, that's, that's why I like the, the outdoor stuff a,  a lot better.
A:	Yeah.
B:	People can entertain themselves, I think, a great deal more, uh, when you have a barbecue. Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and,  uh, you know, nothing really fancy, like your, your shish kabobs, where you have to do a whole bunch of work.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that, that,
A:	shish kabob is, uh, just because it only takes a few minutes to cook, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you get it ready,
A:	you have to do a lot of work beforehand, I agree, and buy special stuff.
A:	But, uh, so far as getting out there and, and putting it on, it only takes a a few minutes, uh.
B:	Right.
A:	But anyway, I'm, I'm thinking of the easy way, rather than,  my guests, I guess,
A:	but, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	Well, I, I think you do, do a lot of work.
B:	Even if people do bring over things, you still do, uh, all the, uh,  housework and get everything prepared and utensils and just, just everything.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
B:	I'm thinking about, uh, special dishes,
B:	and, uh, yeah,
B:	it was made out of rice and consume soup, uh, and bacon and onions.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And then you'd simmer it like all day long.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh it would,
A:	You'd get the odor of it, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And it was just, it was just wonderful.
B:	That's, that's something that I would really like to, uh, to try and find the recipe for.
B:	But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time. Because you can, you can put it on top of the stove, and do this,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yes.
B:	and, and there's so much broth and juice in there,  that it has to, uh, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it to, uh, uh, to come out fluffy and, and nice.
A:	Oh, great.
B:	And that was, you know,
B:	when you were talking about the, the Polish dishes, uh, some goulashes and things like that.
B:	That's, uh, that's what I thought about, was that Armenian rice dish.
A:	Oh, yes,
A:	we probably ought to try this.
A:	But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered.
A:	I guess it gets better and better as we remember it,  back, as we get older, you know.
B:	That's true.
A:	But we probably should try it, uh, to do that.
B:	That's true.
A:	The recipes are really interesting, you know.
A:	We're probably going to lose them
A:	and we'll probably forget all about them, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Since we're trying to make everything so
A:	here I am talk about trying to make everything easy, you know.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	I, uh,
A:	you talked about Thanksgiving, there are interesting meals at different times.
A:	Uh, something,
A:	my wife's from Texas,
A:	so, uh, I remember we were first married
A:	and we were living in New Jersey.
A:	And, uh, we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas, you know, to have a meal.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we were on the way over,
A:	we were just married that very year,
A:	and she said, Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey.
A:	I said, Turkey?
A:	I said, We don't have turkey at Christmas
B:	Oh.
A:	I said, We only have turkey on Thanksgiving.
A:	I said, We're going to have a ham.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She said, What?
B:	Yeah!
A:	I said, Yeah.
A:	I said, No, turkey is only for Thanksgiving.
A:	And because she had turkey a lot, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that was surprising in the, in the east, uh,
A:	we always had ham, you know.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and, and that's one thing
A:	that's another recipe, I guess, we could talk about.
A:	Now the hams just kind of, you know, go take it out of a can or, uh, uh, a package, sliced, uh,
A:	the cans were cooked for hours and hours and, and were just wonderful, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I'd like to try that too.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know what I found was, at Sam's, uh, Wholesale uh, stores.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, what they have is this honey baked ham,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I saw them.
B:	They,
A:	That's good.
B:	have you seen, have you had any of those?
A:	No,
A:	I, I, uh, I've, I know about Sam's.
A:	My wife I think goes
A:	but,
B:	If, if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, uh, twenty dollars, for, uh, I don't remember how many pounds it was.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you cook it in the bag that they send it in.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And all the juices and everything are all sealed in.
B:	And, I tell you what, it's never failed to come out tender and juicy,  and just  and just delicious. Because I normally don't like ham, because it's so salty.
A:	Oh, I haven't heard  of that, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But with this honey bake that they have, that, that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse.
B:	It is absolutely delicious.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And it slices great. Uh-huh.
A:	I'm trying to think of his name of it.
A:	Uh, uh, I don't know, uh.
A:	I see a can here, or a box here of Gourmet Choice.
A:	Uh, he delivers, uh.
A:	What is the name of this thing?
A:	I got a box, distributor, marked on it,
A:	it doesn't say, Gourmet Choices.
A:	But he,
A:	but it's a company that has, uh, you know, a truck that comes around.
A:	And, and they recently had hams.
A:	They have steaks and,  and, uh, actually, pirogies and all that stuff that, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I wish I could tell you the name of the company,
A:	but I don't know what it is.
A:	But, uh, they recently had a ham, that was supposed to be,
A:	it was boneless
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we tried it.
A:	It was real nice,
A:	and it was fully cooked and everything.
A:	We had it for breakfast a long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was really great.
B:	Wow!
B:	You know, that sounds like it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But that's, that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy.
A:	I would like to try the old recipe though, of cooking it,
A:	and, and I keep saying this, uh, to, to do the different things that we did.
A:	But I would like to put one in the oven, you know, the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours, and see if,
A:	because I don't think in, in my married life, which is, uh, twenty-six years now, we've never done that, you know.
B:	Wow.
A:	And I remember that when I was a kid, uh,  to have the ham cooking. Uh, rather than that, we just,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally, you know.
B:	Right
A:	And that's it, you know.
A:	In the old days, we had, hams were the meal,
A:	and I don't, I don't think we,  really have it as a main meal.
B:	Right.
B:	That's true.
B:	I, I don't think so anymore, not with more, becoming more conscious of, uh, fat and cholesterol and, and all those good things.
A:	Right.
A:	That's an interesting point.
A:	How, how have you changed your, your meals now?
A:	Have you,
A:	into that, uh,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	looking at those things?
B:	Well, my parents actually started it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, getting,
A:	Parents, that's unusual.
B:	Well, it, it's true.
B:	I think my parents are very unusual because, uh, we grew up in the south, where, uh, you have all the, uh, you know, biscuits and gravy and, oh, fried foods galore.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And then gradually they started switching over to, uh, plain rice, uh, no gravy.
A:	That's amazing.
B:	It's just, it really is.
B:	They, uh, they're actually, they actually, uh, uh, led us through it, versus, uh, us teaching them, you know, the, uh, the finer points.
B:	But my mother has really high cholesterol,
B:	so it was one of the reasons which started them off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And they started doing this, like in the early, or in about the middle seventies.
A:	Well, that's amazing,
B:	Uh, yeah.
A:	they'd go,
A:	that they have started.
A:	Usually it's the younger people doing it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's true,
B:	it's true.
B:	I agree with you.
A:	I,
A:	uh,  my, my wife's mother is the only grandparent left,
B:	So, it's really neat.
A:	and, uh,  she has high cholesterol.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Of course, I I have too, but not like hers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I always get after her about salt and everything else.
A:	And she just will, I mean, she's going to eat the same way she ate, you know,  her whole life.
B:	That's right.
A:	And she just tells, more or less tells me to shut up, you know.
B:	Right
A:	And, uh, I like to,
A:	I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, it's, it's not the
A:	. I listen to, uh, Larry Newarth on the weekend.
A:	He's a fitness expert
A:	and, uh, he talks about, you know, the chicken and the rice and everything else.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and, uh, throwing away peanut butter and all the things  you know, the things not to eat, you know, ever.
A:	I think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever.
A:	And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk.
B:	Wow!
A:	You know, try that sometime.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My wife says she can't stand it.
A:	But, uh, when I make scrambled eggs now, talking about a recipe,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I,
A:	say if I have four eggs, not, not for me,
A:	but if I'm making four eggs, uh, even for my daughter and I, I'll take out all the yolks but one.
B:	Wow!
A:	And and it's fine.
A:	You, you don't miss it, uh.
B:	Huh.
A:	In fact, when I, when I make eggs for myself, if I, if I fry them, throw them in there, I will almost hard fry them so I can take, not eat the yolk at all.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And you don't really miss it.
A:	You get the flavor of the yolk,
A:	but, uh you don't eat it at all, you know.
A:	You don't,
A:	they're hard.
A:	You get like, uh, a bite at, at the most.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so, uh, for cholesterol, I mean, I'm trying that.
A:	And it has worked.
A:	My cholesterol gone down twenty points.
A:	So, although,
B:	Wow, that's good.
A:	I haven't gotten on the, which, whether butter or not cholesterol, margarine and all that.
A:	I don't know, know, whether any of that is true, you know Whether the margarines or butter,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	What can we do about crime?
B:	I don't know.
B:	The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people
B:	and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.
B:	That's one thing I guess I could think of
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, it's definitely a big concern,
B:	I mean every day it's, you know, all
B:	we live in a little small town,
B:	and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time.
B:	And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well I,
B:	So it's pretty scary.
A:	I'm, I'm from Butler,
A:	and I can't say that there's too much of that there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Unless they start enforcing the, uh,
B:	It's rough, because
A:	like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences.
A:	That's the only thing I can think of.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.
B:	I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries
B:	and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.
B:	So that's definitely something.
B:	They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I, uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And one things that they're saying, now,
B:	are you going,
B:	are you a student
B:	or are you in the work force
B:	or,
A:	Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.
B:	And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.
A:	Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.
B:	And they don't really,
A:	You know, what I mean?
B:	Wow.
A:	A lot of times the girls don't even report it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Um, I've heard of a few case up here,
A:	but I can't say that I've heard of, uh, you know, any significant amount.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.
B:	Yeah.
B:	They say like only one in ten are reported.
B:	I believe it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's awful.
B:	So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.
B:	I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.
B:	But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's probably something else they could do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know,
B:	it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.
B:	And that's like as long as,
B:	it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,
B:	because these kids are saying why should I go to high school
B:	and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.
B:	So that's certainly a big problem.
B:	I don't know what the solution to that is.
B:	Having more drug treatment centers available.
B:	Jeez, I don't know.
A:	Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know a lot of people that partake in that.
A:	And I'm not saying they're bad people,
A:	but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because it ends up,
B:	even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,
B:	huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's definitely got to do with crime.
B:	You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.
B:	I mean, just, oh,
B:	gosh, horrible stuff like that.
B:	One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They said, uh, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,
B:	and their moms are crack users.
B:	So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I don't know who's the victim there.
B:	I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.
B:	And, it's a very complicated problem.
B:	I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh.
A:	No, I don't either.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I guess that's about all I have to say.
A:	Uh,
B:	Is there anything else you would want to,
A:	No.
B:	Okay.
A:	I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas
A:	and something's going to have to be done sooner
A:	but,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't, I don't know what they can do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	It's frustrating.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well,
B:	Okay.
B:	Well,  thanks for talking.
A:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Have a good day.
A:	You too.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye, bye.
B:	Uh, basically I'm at home
B:	and I have two cats and my husband,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean my husband's great.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	It's wonderful,  you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever,
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Around there, huh.
B:	So, yeah.
A:	Well, you're, you're just a youngster then
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm just a spring chicken, I guess
A:	I passed the fifty.
A:	So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles,
A:	so it should be real interesting.
B:	Well,
B:	Righto
A:	So, you think we're ready?
B:	I think I'm ready
A:	Okay
A:	okay.
A:	Uh, you want to start off?
B:	Well, let's see,
B:	the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh,
B:	since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, uh, it's been a big change.
A:	Very much, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Very much,
B:	and I think you'll have to agree
B:	and and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties,
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical,
B:	it has a radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.
A:	I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, they come in that way.
B:	And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's okay
B:	and I think, uh, you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much.
B:	So in, in contrast to the women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then the women change around them.
A:	I hadn't thought much about that,
A:	but that is true.
A:	That,
B:	Uh, I think men are trying.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some of them.
B:	But they don't have a national organization of men,  to, uh, help them out
A:	No.
B:	and uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,  where both team, it has to be a team partnership now,
A:	Very much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they both have to work
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they both have to raise the children,  if we're going to have any kind of future at all,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, the me, oh,
B:	I don't know,
B:	the, the yuppiedom,  the whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they wanted to compete with men,
B:	they wanted to be like men,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's wrong.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men
A:	Not,
A:	no,
A:	they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.
B:	Absolutely,
B:	and so that's, you know,
B:	they sort of threw the thing back another, you know, ten years,  that they've had to, you know, restructure,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day,
B:	I got to get some for all my men friends,
B:	it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do
A:	There you go
A:	There's a lot of truth in that.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, we shouldn't,
B:	we were made differently,  however you come to that conclusion,
B:	we were biologically, physiologically, made differently
B:	and there is great wonderment,  in that,
B:	and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other
B:	so,
A:	Yes,
A:	it shouldn't be destroyed.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And, and, you know, just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it's, it's viva la difference  someone said that
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that you can truly respect the other person,
B:	I mean, you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know you know.
B:	Depends,
A:	Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well that depends on what day of the month it is.
A:	Yeah
B:	But, uh, I don't know,
B:	I guess we've gotten more of a,
B:	in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
B:	and,
A:	I think now when both are working they have a more more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, that's, that's a very different way to do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, the woman doesn't start off at home,  raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know,
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Because you get set in your ways
A:	and it's,  really hard because to, to really to get help. Uh, you know to get the work load shared.
B:	Are, are you married?
A:	Yes,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Our,
B:	Do you have children?
A:	I, we have five children,
A:	they're They're all grown and on their own
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	so,
B:	Oh, my.
A:	They're, uh,
B:	How did you do?
A:	Uh, how do you mean that?
B:	Well, I mean, okay,
B:	well did you have boys, girls,
B:	how did,
B:	how,
A:	Uh, we have, uh, two girls and three boys
A:	and our,  our baby girl just had a baby girl
B:	Oh, my.
B:	Oh, my.
A:	Last week was her first baby.
B:	Oh, how exiting.
A:	So it's been real exciting.
B:	I, I tell you what.
B:	I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I just love the babies
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that, it's,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Have you been that way long?
B:	Just eight years,
B:	just
A:	Just eight years.
B:	the most important years of my life you know
A:	That's, that's a long eight years, though.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it has been.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but that's another story.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps,
B:	I mean I, I couldn't ask for a better life.
A:	That makes a big difference.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean if this is the way it had to be,  this is the best way,  I could possibly do it
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things that really,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort,  of thing
A:	Yes.
B:	and,
A:	Well, probably your role
A:	and, and the way you are also has changed, though. You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	I mean, boy,
B:	I mean I, I would have had so,
B:	I had so much guilt to begin with
B:	and the changes that had to take place, you know,  where I couldn't do a lot of things and, uh, just adjusting to that,  that, uh, yeah, that was a major change,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but so, I guess uh, in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can,
B:	but but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,
A:	The best you can, yeah.
B:	they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,
B:	I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation.
A:	I,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and security.
A:	That,
A:	I think that's being damaged, uh,  a lot.
B:	I think,  we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, uh, oh, not very nurturing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think,
A:	I do, too.
A:	I, I think, uh,
A:	now some, some women can, can do both.
A:	They're very capable of working
A:	and, and,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but I wish they weren't so many,
B:	I, I wish they weren't role models for everybody,  because it's so dangerous.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It, it really is, yeah.
B:	It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that
B:	and then when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,  you know, her life sort of falls apart
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she doesn't know who she is
B:	and she's,
A:	So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,
B:	Absolutely.
A:	or they say they do anyways,
A:	and, but I think ones that don't have to, the,
A:	it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.
B:	Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.
A:	Well, that could be.
B:	Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south you know, a woman's role is,  a woman's role,  sort of thing,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you know,
A:	You mean it's stronger there?
B:	Uh, oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Much stronger.
B:	And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here,  with the good old boys,  here in Texas sort of thing,  making career moves
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	but, Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years. I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	That's the woman's role,
A:	Yes.
B:	and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes,
B:	but then I'm not there,
B:	so I don't know that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	And I have women that do both
B:	and I see a little jealousy on the part of, you know, the woman what has two little boys
B:	and, and she has an au pair, which is a live-in college kid working for her
B:	and then she has her business in the back
A:	Uh.
B:	and then my other girlfriend that has, you know, just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy,  all the time.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And so I see I little bit of that
B:	and I always wish there was a balance, you know,  with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge,  for a while
A:	Right.
A:	But they're both,
B:	Get some peace and quiet.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're both different people, too.
A:	That's, That's where the trouble lies.
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely,
B:	so. You're right about that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,
B:	And that's,
A:	and others can't.
B:	That's true.
B:	That's so true.
B:	How, how did your daughter do it?
A:	Uh, well, uh, I have one daughter that works full-time.
A:	She has two little boys.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, they seem to do fine.
A:	She has been has talked about quitting, you know, and staying home for a few years.
A:	But then, it's real hard because she's got an excellent job.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh.
A:	Go ahead.
A:	So Ken, how do you do your family budget?
B:	Well, we don't actually have a budget, budget per se.
B:	What we do is, uh, maintain a normal checkbook. You know, like, everyone in the world does, I guess,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and occasionally it actually balances,
B:	And, um, we also, we, um, we have a, a U S Air and Visa card.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Every, every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.
B:	So what we, what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight.
B:	Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	So what we'll do is,
A:	Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month?
B:	Right.
B:	We actually maintain a,
B:	we have, a, we, we, we, we have a checking account that we treat like a savings,
B:	scratch that,
B:	we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And so what we do is, we anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already.
B:	So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything.
A:	Oh.
A:	That's a real good idea.
B:	It keeps us hopping.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See, now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that.
A:	Before we got married I had money in the bank.
A:	I owned my own home.
A:	I put in so much money, each, you know, month towards long term savings, you know, like in, uh, mutual funds and things, you know,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and, uh, after I got married,
A:	no,
A:	it just didn't work anymore.
A:	She spends a lot.
A:	She likes to spend on anything and everything With body lotion, everything
A:	So, we really haven't, we don't have a good organized system, yet.
A:	Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something
A:	I don't think,
B:	Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you're pay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We did that for awhile where, um,
B:	we actually still do it with, with my wife's salary,  where we put it, we have a separate, a third account even, a savings account in, in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week.
B:	I'm a graduate student.
A:	Yes.
A:	So am I.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	In what field?
A:	Well, uh, in information systems.
A:	I'm a voice researcher.
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	I'm in, uh, psycholinguistics, actually.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Um, but my wife has a real job.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So does mine.
B:	Yeah
B:	What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her paycheck each week.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And put it, it goes directly to another account, that we don't, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily,
B:	and it goes there
B:	and it stays there
B:	and it builds up until we need it for something.
A:	Yeah.
A:	See, I think we might have to do that
A:	Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.
A:	It's going to be hard for her to, uh, not have her own money. Because, like now, you know, I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years.
A:	And now she wants to go back to school,
A:	but she saved enough maybe to get her through August.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know, and that's it.
A:	And I keep saying, now, Laura, you're going to have to save a little money.
A:	I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through.
A:	It doesn't work, Ken
B:	Gee.
A:	My mother always said, "now, don't argue about money",
A:	so we don't.
B:	Right.
A:	But, you know, there goes my savings
B:	God.
A:	But, you know, it's one of those things.
B:	I got lucky.
B:	My wife apparently is not a,
B:	she likes to spend,
B:	but she's pretty good about things.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Now, see my wife will do things like make clothes.
B:	Wow.
A:	One of our, one of our big investments that, you know, I was wholeheartedly in favor of, was to buy a sewing machine. Because she makes clothes.
A:	And, you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out
A:	and she's already made, you know, presents and gifts and things for,  shorts for me and things for the summer.
A:	You know, so I guess I can't, you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, uh,  yeah, with the savings from that.
A:	So I can't complain too much, you know,
A:	she's, she's good about that.
A:	And, also, we, we dine at home a lot.
A:	You know, she likes to cook.
A:	So that saves us from restaurants or whatever
A:	but,  but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. You know.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, I guess we all have those feelings.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, uh, I uh, I, I go to, uh,
B:	I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, you know.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	You know, but you need a hobby.
B:	Right.
B:	Exactly,
B:	but that to her is sort of like a waste.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	But she does her nails.
B:	So,
A:	I know,
A:	and those nails are so expensive
A:	Oh, gosh.
A:	I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore.
A:	I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then she waits for them to get their color back.
A:	And then she'll polish them again.
A:	I don't know, whatever.
A:	So she stopped for awhile.
A:	Boy, what a difference.
A:	They buy nail polish every two weeks,
A:	it's, uh,
A:	my gosh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And lotion, oh, my goodness, body lotion,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, uh,
A:	she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year.
B:	Yeah
B:	Good old Ivory
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's funny.
B:	Um, well, it's for your benefit though, right.
A:	Oh, I think so,
A:	she's always soft.
A:	That's true.
B:	, so that's helpful.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But I think, um,
A:	I don't know,
A:	maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving.
A:	I think, uh,  I think that's, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Now do you still own a house?
B:	You said you owned one.
A:	I sold my house.
A:	And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. Um,
B:	That's great.
B:	Right.
A:	we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job.
A:	So that makes it hard with, uh, you know,
A:	we're paying double rent, double utilities,
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	and that makes it sort of expensive
A:	but see, I live within my,  I live within my very menial income
A:	and she doesn't
A:	She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.
A:	So I just get a,
B:	that's the killer, two apartments,
A:	yeah,
A:	and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twenty-five, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend,
A:	and that really adds up too, you know,
A:	so it gets tough,
B:	Wow.
A:	I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone.
A:	You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by five, by four-fifths, you know,   if she's here,
B:	Eventually, right.
B:	I mean you're not going to,
B:	Right.
A:	so it's actually tough this year,
A:	but it will be better in June.
A:	She will move in with me in June,
A:	so hopefully our budget will in increase then.
B:	Have you been married for long?
A:	No.
A:	Just since December.
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	So you guys really are newlyweds.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We're, very newlyweds,
A:	but that's the,
A:	we, we're together probably for, um, uh, very close for about six months before we got married.
A:	So, you know, we lived within,
A:	though I had my own house and things, you know, we still, uh, we're still pretty close.
A:	I knew her spending habits
A:	and they're about the same
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	they haven't changed at all, you know.
A:	My mother always said to me, "Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father.
A:	Never say a word when you're wife spends money".
A:	And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes. Because I think, you know, um, I sort of feel guilty, you know, given that she makes twice as much as I do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of .
A:	I don't argue with her,
A:	but I just get all,
A:	it must show in my face.
A:	Must be like, must be cringes or something, you know,  especially yesterday or this past weekend.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We met half way between, at her parents house
A:	and, um, she had on a new pair of jeans
B:	and those people probably
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	okay
B:	Did you go to Baylor by any chance?
A:	No,
A:	I I went to U T at Austin.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	that's even better.
A:	And I, I just happen to work at a Waco station, because you know.
B:	I went to,
B:	or you in radio, or television or news.
A:	broadcast news, T V,
B:	Uh, my journalism degree is in,
B:	Are you still there?
A:	Yes.
B:	Okay,
B:	it worked out fine.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, we just ate out, um, had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late
B:	and we had Italian, um,
B:	have you ever been to the Olive Garden?
A:	No,
A:	I haven't,
A:	is that good?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, do you really like Italian food?
A:	it's not my favorite
A:	but,  I like it's okay.
B:	Then don't,
B:	Then this will probably,
B:	I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
B:	but it's, um,
B:	you're not going to believe this
B:	but I have to tell you this if I don't because you're in Plano,
A:	That's okay.
B:	but my, um, softball unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison
B:	It wasn't that bad,
B:	actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	which I'm not Italian,
B:	no,
B:	it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the,  salads you can eat with an entree.
A:	Oh.
A:	Oh, that sounds really good.
B:	So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't
B:	but I was more in the mood for french toast any way
B:	so,  so I really like Italian food though,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but do you have any favorite?
A:	Well are there just the two of you?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, when my husband and I go out we have four children.
B:	Oh, you're kidding.
A:	So that makes a difference.
A:	For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can,
A:	the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best.
B:	Oh, sure.
A:	But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive,
A:	so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family,  and like that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for,  like at Gatti's or something like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
A:	and we usually head on down, um, oh what's the freeway down here?
B:	Uh, six thirty-five?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And there are, um, all along that, that freeway there are restaurant
A:	but one of our favorites is Pappasito's.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	Pappasito's.
A:	No,
A:	we love to go there.
B:	We went there on my birthday in March it's great.
A:	You know it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much
A:	it's too,
B:	too much like a bar naturally,  and Mexico,
A:	Yeah
B:	yeah,
B:	I know,
B:	I've seen it.
A:	But I love the food I love the food,
B:	The food is probably,
A:	the food is great.
B:	I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means
B:	but it's probably the best tasting,
B:	I don't know would you classify that as Tex-Mex?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, the shredded beef the type of,  spices or sauces they use.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I like to get that, uh,
A:	a shrimp it's a shrimp dish,
B:	Really.
A:	and I don't remember the name of it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's rolled up into, into something,
A:	and oh, it's really good.
B:	I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they are really good.
B:	Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only thing I don't like about it too
B:	it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, um, be around not be around that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat.
B:	The one thing I notice is it's just, um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, I mean we find prohibited,  just to cost any more?
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's very expensive.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't know how you feel about that
B:	but I think that some of it's over priced.
A:	Yeah
B:	I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are
A:	Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is I don't know, um,
A:	No,
A:	sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark,  um, go to the August Moon which is down there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's a Chinese,  uh, restaurant with the lions in the front,
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	my husband likes that.
B:	yeah,
B:	off of Arapaho down there?
A:	yeah,
A:	and, Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese,
B:	Yeah,
B:	August Moon,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but Chinese isn't my favorite
A:	so,
B:	I don't like it at all usually
B:	so
A:	But he likes it kind of
A:	so he heats us up a good fight
A:	now, me I'm like I said seafood I'm,
A:	I like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I love seafood,
A:	So.
B:	and I, I like a lot of different ethnic foods.
B:	I like Japanese food.
B:	There's a place on Greenville called Sagar's .
A:	Um.
B:	Well, we haven't been in years down near Presby ,
B:	and I had a meeting down there today
B:	and I saw that
B:	and I said, gee I remember that they offer you, um, authentic Japanese feeding,  or American or piano bar,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I remember when we went  we were married with another couple that was just dating
B:	and, um, I had never had saki.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It made all raw fish tastes great
B:	but if you're looking for a very, uh,
B:	it's very pretty inside,
A:	Is it?
B:	and the girls wear kimonos and, You know, if you're ever looking for that.
A:	Oh, how nice.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um, but what other kind of foods,
B:	gee I don't know
B:	we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville,  which was really over priced.
A:	I don't know that place.
A:	Was it?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	They had a great desert bar.
A:	Um.
A:	That's what we need isn't it?
B:	Yeah.
A:	No,
A:	there's a lot of nice barbecue places here,
A:	now, I like barbecue okay, Texas barbecue.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I like,  barbecue,
A:	It's good.
B:	have you ever been to I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue?
A:	Yeah,
A:	now,  they're real good.
B:	That's real good,
B:	Yeah.
A:	They are good.
B:	There had,
B:	oh my husband's going upstairs,
B:	and he says free ice cream
A:	Yeah,
A:	free ice cream,
A:	yeah.
B:	I didn't know they had that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert,  today, which I never eat at lunch
A:	Oh.
B:	and it was wonderful.
A:	Just to die for exactly.
B:	It was,
A:	Oh.
B:	in fact if I could pick my, um, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be,  yes, I would be in hog heaven.
A:	In heaven
B:	And how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
B:	or do you still order for them?
A:	Well, my two littlest,
A:	I just had a baby,
B:	Oh, congratulations.
A:	and she's six months
A:	and then my four year old he, he still,
A:	but my other older two they can.
A:	So,  they're they're kind of,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's
B:	Yeah,
B:	everybody, every child that I even know that eats vegetables, um, looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's.
A:	Oh, I'm telling you.
B:	It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then.
A:	Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so there's a H Avenue down here,  and along are these fast food restaurants
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I know where that,
B:	Right
B:	that's all,
A:	So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing,
A:	and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own.
B:	Well, that's all right as long as,
A:	that's on the nights we can't decide.
B:	I was going to say because with six people how do you, um,
B:	cause with two we have a problem,
B:	I mean I can't even imagine, you know, trying to, um,
B:	you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children.
A:	Well, five of them, they're good, kids.
B:	That's the way the,
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, we're getting ready to
B:	I shouldn't say this on this conversation,
B:	but it's just on my mind,
B:	we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt.
A:	Oh, how nice.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we're excited,
A:	It will be neat.
B:	I think it will be worth it
B:	and somebody said to me in terms of,
B:	this is food so I can say this,
B:	but they, you have to bring a formula,
B:	and I said what's that
B:	They laughed
B:	and I said well, you know, I'm.  thirty something,
A:	Food's, food.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that that would make them drool any way.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot of restaurants don't take,
B:	in terms of talking about restaurants, I mean are a lot of restaurants, how are they when you have children let alone three or four children?
A:	You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that,  that really is more adults you know,  with the atmosphere and everything,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
A:	they,
A:	if you're,
A:	like we could probably take our oldest son and,  and our oldest daughter.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they know how to act,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction
A:	and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing.
B:	That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	I just, I just, I've been in some places where they say they take children,
B:	and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And that always just bothered me
B:	and then, um, on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves
A:	Yeah
B:	I don't know what other kind of restaurants
B:	really Pappasito's we love, um,
B:	we went to one Italian,
B:	back on the Italian, we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food.
A:	Oh.
B:	I can't remember the name of it
B:	it's on, uh,
A:	Is it Tia's, not Tia's, um,
B:	No,
B:	that's Mexican, um, right across from on the Dillard's side there,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know which one it is,
A:	and I can't think of it.
B:	I can't,
B:	yeah
B:	it's in the strip, yeah,
B:	and it had white tablecloth,
B:	I think it was like paper where you could write on them, or something with crayons
B:	it was just terrible.
A:	Oh dear.
B:	I mean I was shocked,
B:	I mean the dish was dirty, um,
A:	It was one of these you have bad experience and,  say I don't think I'll come back here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	where you felt like,  like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something.
A:	Oh dear.
B:	Um.
A:	Oh.
B:	Boy,
B:	but other then that I don't know we, we do our share of pizza eating too, but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too,  cheap to pay the delivery
A:	Oh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I don't like strange people coming to my door, um,
A:	Well, I, I've got
A:	one of my favorites were
A:	and I can't really think of any other, um, places.
B:	No,
B:	except that this makes me fat.
B:	No,
B:	I'm just kidding.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you have to watch it if you go out to eat
A:	that's true.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true,
B:	but you can always blame it on having children,
B:	no
A:	Yeah,
A:	there you go.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you,
B:	and I guess, you know, Maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere.
A:	Well, good luck.
A:	Yeah,
A:	maybe.
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, we're just starting a family through adoption
A:	so I don't really have a lot of, uh, concrete, uh, opinions.
A:	Just what I know out of my peer group, uh, has gone through.
A:	And none of it has been good
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies,  They seem to be having an okay time.
B:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, uh,
A:	I'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers that I'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but I,
A:	there must be some good service out there if you  really look and pay for it.
B:	Right.
B:	What, what age child are you thinking in terms of?
A:	In terms of what they're talking about.
B:	No.
B:	For, for yourselves
A:	Oh.
A:	Infant. Uh ...
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Infant.
B:	So you're starting from the from the baseline.
A:	Yeah.
A:	After eleven years of marriage. Yeah, we are.
A:	We're actually, it's happening now.
A:	So, we're just going through the process.
B:	I see
A:	So and actually the question is, uh, very appropriate.
A:	Cause I'm not sure whether, uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be.
A:	They tell me it's going to be strong
A:	Do you  have children?
B:	Right.
B:	I have one son.
A:	And did you put him in daycare
A:	or is he older now or younger
A:	or?
B:	Well, he's, he's now eighteen. And in, in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university.
A:	Sure.
A:	So he's out of daycare
B:	I,
B:	right.
B:	And, and so that,
B:	but I was working full-time, uh  when he was born.
A:	You,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	But I was very lucky because I was a, a college professor.
A:	Oh.
B:	And so I was able to, you know,
B:	and I, it was  walking distance from, from  my apartment.
A:	Flex .
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I went up there
B:	and I sort of left him with, with a neighbor.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little
B:	And I said, you know, he doesn't need anything except, you know, look at him if he cries.
B:	But, you know, don't pick him up and, and  this sort of stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half.
A:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	And I was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, uh, cooperated.
A:	Right.
B:	And ...
A:	That's wonderful.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and I guess, uh, because of your, um, your, uh, profession.
A:	I mean, I, uh, I'm in corporate communications.
A:	But I've done free-lance writing in the past,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so what we're hoping is that, uh,
A:	I mean my husband thinks I can do it.
A:	I've just never worked out of a domestic base, you know.
A:	I've always  been in a corporate, uh, environment.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but I'm hoping that possibly I can do something where I can go flextime or part-time
A:	or if they don't have that, uh,
A:	my boss,
A:	I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building.
A:	So, I think that's something that couples need in going  into this.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, I don't know.
A:	I do think there's good daycare out there.
A:	What part of the country are you in?
B:	I'm in Maryland.
A:	You're in Maryland.
B:	But, but I was out of the country when, uh, my, my son was little.
B:	But, but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what I did.  Which is you know, be there short times
A:	Right.
A:	That's what I'm hoping.
B:	and then later on when he was, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean this,
B:	we're talking about, uh, I went back to work and, or taught some, some classes like a week after he was born.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	You were  fortunate.
B:	And so ...
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And so that's when I was  saying, you know, don't, don't pick him up and stuff.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	And she, she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then, I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, you know, in a sense she, she carried him around a lot, too much. Uh, you know for, for my taste.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	It was constantly, no, I don't want him,  to explore anything.
B:	He might, uh, he might hurt himself
A:	So do you think that, I mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good good objectivity that, that doesn't really,
A:	that's not a correct English
A:	but , you know  in a sense, you see what I'm saying though.
A:	From a mother's standpoint, I mean in a way, it was quote and unquote good objectivity.
B:	I think it worked out very, very well.
B:	Because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so, he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers or  writing lesson plans.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble
B:	and then he realized that there  were quiet times
A:	Yeah.
B:	and there were active times.
A:	Right.
A:	And then he learned he, he also learned that, uh, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized,
A:	well we're actually, uh, we're getting ready.
A:	I mean, you're far enough away now I can tell you since this is locally, I make sure, we're going to Romania in a few weeks.
B:	Oh.
A:	And that's, uh, just .  Romania.
B:	Did you say Romania or Armenia?
B:	Oh, okay.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	As in, like, what Twenty Twenty and, uh, but we, we're real excited because we've just developed a contact. Through professional people
B:	Oh, good.
A:	and it's private
A:	and it's hospital.
A:	It's, we're just very excited
A:	Uh ... And what's the word I'm looking for.
B:	Oh great.
A:	When you deal with issues like that, uh, in terms of family building through adoption, uh, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare.
B:	Oh that's silly.
A:	Uh, issues are being raised prematurely in my mind.
A:	But I guess they're not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later.
A:	Uh, and I, what I've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion.
A:	I feel that if the child is healthy, uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love to do something like with what you did.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, maybe after two or three or, years old.
A:	I don't know. Um.
B:	Oh, I in my opinion, it's even than.
B:	I mean  your kids need you
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, they need a schedule I think.
A:	I don't think the United States,
A:	what country were you, uh, in Europe when you were uh, uh?
B:	No,
B:	I was in the Middle East.
A:	Uh, that's
A:	Well, that's the same thing.
A:	I mean I don't know how they are there
A:	but, uh, in eastern Europe,
A:	my stepfather's from England,
A:	it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or or elder care, as I call it.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	Uh, and we're just not set up for that.
A:	Uh, with the .
B:	I,
B:	yeah.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	No,
B:	I was just going to say, I guess, uh, my sensitivities are, are much more with the, you know, to be at home.
B:	Because actually, I had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, I think that's wonderful.
B:	And, I mean, that was recently after my son, was going off.
B:	And I mean, yes,
B:	in a sense, I went to work
B:	and she was at home alone some of the time.
B:	But, but still, you know, it was much better than being shipped to
A:	To.
A:	Right.
B:	I think we're we're too, too much towards it's somebody  problem, you know.
A:	We cast off.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	I'm that way.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I want to work.
B:	Shove them in, in some school for twelve hours a day.
A:	Right.
A:	It's easier
A:	and I agree with that.
A:	That's why I you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
A:	but you can probably empathize with this.
A:	It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	In terms of what to do. Uh,
A:	and I just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system.
A:	Uh, my company, I'm particularly fortunate that they have, they're in tune with that.
A:	But I've been at companies where, uh, you know, the, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children.
A:	You know.
A:	And in,
A:	and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people.
A:	And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
A:	and, uh, I respect, there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they, you know, they may have the need for child care like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I agree with you, that it's just, I call it dumping
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I ...
B:	No,
B:	I, I think that certainly there is a role, uh, for this type of help.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or, or, uh, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Then, yeah,
A:	it's  in tandem then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah
A:	I just, uh,
A:	and there are trade-offs too I think.
A:	One of the things that is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it's just, you know, it's so low
A:	but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive.
A:	And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year uh ...
B:	Yeah.
B:	Actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood.
B:	Is
A:	Really.
B:	there seem, there are several, mothers who stay home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they take, you know,
B:	it's probably not completely legal
B:	Uh, I,
B:	maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids.
A:	Sure.
B:	But, and they, they take care of another child
B:	and I, I can actually could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they,
A:	yeah.
B:	And I mean that's another possibility
B:	and, you know, you might want to stay home one year
B:	and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years
B:	and ...
A:	I haven't thought about that.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
A:	and she's at home part-time paralegal.
A:	So I'm thinking, um
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	And we get along fantastically
A:	so I'm thinking, you know.
A:	And that's the way you have to, uh,
A:	how
A:	I'm just real curious.
A:	How was the Middle East in terms of that with children?
A:	Is that, is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?
B:	No.
B:	Well, actually there was a daycare center, uh, where my son did go for a year.
B:	I think from when he was two to three.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But then he actually started kindergarten at age three.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so, and you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,
B:	it was real kindergarten.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	He must be smart.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	So he, he was ready to, to go to school at that point.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, yeah,
B:	they're, they do have such facilities.
B:	But for the most part, uh, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody. Which is much like our neighbor you know, to, sharing responsibility.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm, and also there aren't that many women who, who who work.
A:	The professional.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I was wondering about that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, there,
A:	I'm in Dallas
A:	and there was just a very big, uh, series about Moslem women
A:	and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm digressing here
A:	but, uh, I was just real curious when you said Middle East, if you  didn't mind me asking.
B:	Yeah.
B:	No,
B:	no.
B:	And I didn't mean Israel.
B:	So you, you assumed right
A:	Oh, no
A:	that's okay
A:	Well, even if you did, that's okay actually.
A:	I think ...
B:	Well, no
B:	because at first thought, when I you know, I said that not many people work, I'm, I'm thinking oh, well she's going to, you know, because certainly in Israel the women do work
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
A:	They fight,
A:	they work.
B:	Are you a Vietnam veteran, Dudley?
A:	Uh, no.
B:	No?
B:	Do you have family who were in the Vietnam War?
A:	Uh, no.
A:	My father was, uh, came in right after World War two.
B:	Okay.
B:	So he was too old,
B:	and you were too young, right?
A:	I am too young, yeah.
B:	All right.
B:	Do you know some folks who have been there?
A:	Uh, yes.
B:	Okay.
A:	A couple.
B:	Okay.
B:	How did it influence them?
A:	Uh, the, the one guy I worked with down in Austin hated it.
A:	Uh, he was a lineman down there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And while he was there, he caught some kind of a strange disease.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, all his hair fell out,
A:	and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
A:	and, And, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, what about long lasting effects on him?
B:	Has he still suffering from those problems?
A:	I do not think he was in combat,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I have talked with a number of Vietnam veterans,
B:	and I really, I had no one directly related to me involved.
B:	But, uh, my sister's husband was in Vietnam.
B:	And it, it really made a completely different man out of him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He went to Vietnam one man and came back another, not better.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Then, uh, another friend of mine went,
B:	and he was in combat.
B:	But he came back,
B:	and he said, "Okay, that is it. That is behind me. I am going on with my life."
B:	Much like what Roger Staubach did.
A:	Right.
B:	He was, uh, he was a Vietnam war veteran.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
A:	But he was in the Navy, though, he was .
B:	Yeah.
B:	That is true.
A:	It makes a lot of difference.
B:	Right.
B:	And, but, uh, most of the folks that I have met that were actually on the land, or in combat, are still, still carry a lot of anger.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They really do.
B:	And, uh, I, I, I, I really do not think that we did those young men right.
A:	Huh.
B:	I think that, uh, Desert Storm, shows a lot of learning since that time.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh
A:	Well, the armed forces did so much to, you know, Agent Orange,
A:	they did so much to their own people all during that time.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That is true.
A:	You know, and they they take a, even now, uh, they take a free hand as far as medicine and, uh, you know, how they treat the war casualties, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you come back and your leg is blown off, you know, or, or it is hanging by a thread, they still can't put it back together now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, But what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, you know, one of the most troublesome things that I have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, not so, much that I say, I do not want you here.
B:	But there is just such a surge of southeast Asians.
B:	It has affected the culture of this country, uh, very much.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It's it's about nine or ten percent now.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, uh, the culture is changing.
B:	Look how much more Oriental food we have, restaurants now, for example.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, even ten years ago, there were not that many.
B:	A lot of shops are, are operated by southeast Asians.
A:	That's true .
B:	A lot of people have complained in the schools.
B:	There is a culture change there.
B:	The southeast Asians seem to be very hungry,
B:	there seem to be very studious.
B:	And, uh, tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad.
A:	No.
B:	Not really.
B:	Uh, but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships, for example, uh, even jobs. Uh, jobs that would normally go to an American, with a lesser education, might be going to, to some of these people here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that is all a result of, of, of Vietnam.
B:	And, and you see a lot of, a lot of men that were over there, brought families back.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is,
B:	Uh, and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now.
A:	Well, they are probably not doing very well at all.
B:	I know that there,
A:	Because I know there is, there is still people even in the Dallas area.
A:	There are, there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from, uh, Vietnam.
B:	You are talking about P O W or missing in actions?
A:	Uh,
A:	uh,
A:	native Vietnamese people.
B:	Native Vietnamese people.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	They were lost, you know, when they were little,
A:	and, and they never did get back
A:	or,
B:	Oh, I had not.
B:	That, that had not occurred to me.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That would be an interesting concept.
A:	And, uh, and, as is really a big waste because they didn't, they didn't win,
A:	they didn't regain any of the land that they had.
A:	It spilled over into, uh, now I can't even think of the country.
A:	But,
B:	Cambodia?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and all they did is run and hide.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they were not really fighting, you know,
A:	it, it would have been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, and I am not even sure who was involved more. Whether it was China or Russia.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they were pouring, they were pouring weapons in there and, and advising, well, digging tunnels for them. You know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there is no way that they could ever catch them.
B:	Well, I think the terrain had a lot to do with the, the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that is right.
B:	You know, there is incredible cover in Vietnam.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you can't find much cover on, in a sand dune
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	all they can do is dig in,
A:	and they, you know,
B:	That is right.
A:	and then they try to camouflage the top.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Well now, even, I think even now, and in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job.
A:	Because they could, they could kill all those plants, you know, which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on.
A:	But, and the, and the Corps of Engineers I think do a better job now, like they did in Desert Storm.
A:	Because they had,
B:	Well,
A:	he, he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went.
A:	And they had to, you know, they had to blow them up or, or disarm them.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he, where he had made those moats.
B:	What world war do you think they found the experience for that?
A:	Uh,
B:	Don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam?
A:	yeah,
A:	partially.
B:	Part of it is that, part of it is technology.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Part of it is technology, yeah.
B:	But when, when, When you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam, you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into,
A:	Because all,
A:	go ahead.
B:	and you say, "Never more."
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and you overcome those problems,
B:	and you are prepared next time.
A:	I think that is one of the reasons that they have, they have pretty much avoided getting involved in South America.
A:	Because look what happened when they were looking for Noriega,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He probably just went right down into a tunnel.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well, I know that, uh, from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest assets that we lost.
B:	We did not actually physically lose them.
B:	They did not lose their lives,
B:	but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is right.
B:	Uh, being entirely different people.
B:	I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That is a long time to suffer.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they, they really need,
A:	everybody that has, that has stood there,
A:	it's,
A:	when
A:	in Vietnam I think it was much closer contact.
A:	You stand there with a rifle and blow a, a piece of somebody apart, or blow their head off,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that has to affect you if you are human, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So they had to work all that, that anger out, and the, and the nightmares that come along with it.
B:	I can't, uh,
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	You bet,
A:	I do not, I do not really think that anybody can ever forget that,
B:	you bet.
A:	but they can, they can reason and, and try to adjust to, to why they were there.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now.
B:	They say, "Well, we're, going to listen to this and we are going to look at this, find out what our mistakes were, and we are not going to make them again."
B:	But that does not undo the ones that were done.
B:	And that is what makes the veterans angry.
A:	Right.
B:	And I cannot blame them.
B:	I do not know a solution.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I sure cannot blame them for being angry.
B:	On the other hand, you know, you can be angry about something for a very long time,
B:	or you can say, "Well, that is the way it is," and go on with your life.
B:	Uh,
A:	Right.
B:	For the most part, I wish that it had not happened.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But it did.
A:	And that, and that was, that was in the, in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything, you know.
A:	And, and, and they initially got into it because of Eisenhower.
A:	And he just, he did not want to be in it any more than, than what we started out in August with Desert Storm.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And then it just blew up into the war.
B:	Well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though.
B:	I can remember when I was in the sixth grade,
B:	and that was many years ago.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia.
A:	French, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, and, and, and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on.
A:	Right, yeah.
B:	There, there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	I really, I do not know,
B:	we should not have maybe gotten involved.
B:	But if we did, we certainly should have supported our people who were there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	More so supported them when they got home.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part.
A:	Exactly.
B:	And I, I saw the movie, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,
B:	and I think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	More than, what was, APOCALYPSE NOW
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, Dudley, have we pretty well discussed the subject?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think so.
B:	Well, I think so.
B:	I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Yes,
A:	it was nice talking to you.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	So, P C personal computers.
A:	Do you have a personal computer?
B:	No
B:	I don't, not at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I work with them quite a bit though.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I, I work with them at Kelly Services, doing, uh, data entry.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you, what do you think about them?
B:	Well, I think they're useful,
B:	I think they're in some instances they're, they're over used,
B:	well, that's not the right way to say it.
A:	You mean instead of people
A:	or,
B:	Well I think that, uh, some, some work places where I've been they, they set up
B:	like every body has their own P C which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a P C,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it really,
B:	without them knowing how to use it properly, it slows them down, more than it helps them accomplish something.
A:	Right.
B:	They spend more time messing with the P C than they would actually accomplishing the tasks that they're trying to do if they didn't have a P C at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And you really have to be able to type pretty fast before, you know, before it really saves time.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you have to, you know, be familiar with it,
B:	like there're so many different software packages, it, you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	A lot of times, uh, people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly,
B:	and so they waste more time with their trying to, uh, figure out how to do, you know, other things, than they would if they, if they actually understood what they were trying to do.
B:	You know, like, uh, they want to, to format a report a certain way
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could, they could do that in about, you know, half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly.
A:	To set up the boundaries correctly, and how many lines you're going to use in an,
B:	Right,
B:	exactly.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	A lot of times they, they, they do it manually on the computer, which just really is a waste of time,
B:	and then, if they ever have to change anything in that, in that, in the document, they have to go back and redo it all manually, whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly, the package would do that for them whenever they wanted to make a change,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Can't you, can't you put, Can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it, if you need to when you go back.
B:	so I, I've seen that as a problem.
B:	Right,
B:	but in some, in some cases the with the formatting, what I'm talking about is that they would set up, they set up a certain document,
B:	and it may be eight pages long.
A:	Right.
B:	And they set it up manually, so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And and um,
B:	And, um, then when they have to make a change, say they want to insert a paragraph. They got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the,
A:	Rewrite the whole thing.
B:	if, if they had set up the formatting on the system itself, it would do that for them, and save them a lot of time.
B:	But a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package.
A:	How does the word wrap work on that?
A:	Do you end up with very different length lines?
B:	Oh, no,
B:	no
B:	you can left and right justify the whole thing.
B:	It comes out just perfectly spaced like a block.
A:	Um.
B:	It'll, it'll automatically,
B:	it's like typesetting.
B:	It'll automatically do that for you.
A:	And it divides the words by itself?
B:	Usually it doesn't divide words.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	They usually have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you see, like in a newspaper, they typeset.
B:	They don't usually break words in a newspaper.
A:	Right.
B:	If the, if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line, they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	They space it out in, in the line itself.
B:	Right.
A:	Oh.
B:	And most computers do that.
A:	They,
B:	Most most software packages will do that for you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I've, I've known people that have used a package for, for five years, you know,
B:	and I would say, well, have you, you know, you know more about this package than I do,
B:	how do you left justify?
B:	And they would say, I don't know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was that caused this to happen.
B:	And they would say, how did you do that?
B:	And I'm like, well it's really easy.
B:	And they were like, well, I never knew that.
B:	So obviously they'd never considered looking it up, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you think it's a lack of training,
A:	or it's just that they don't use the materials that are available to them.
B:	Sometimes it's,
B:	sometimes,
B:	well, it's a number of different things.
B:	Sometimes they don't, uh, they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual.
B:	Some manuals aren't really designed very well.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But some of them, are,
B:	and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it, that just a basic, general user can understand them.
B:	So, I think, um, people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would,
B:	and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time, because they think, well, it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's better to learn it directly from the manual.
B:	Well, I think so.
A:	Especially when you have to trouble shoot some things.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Because a lot of the times the computer the program still has, uh, bugs in it,
A:	and you have to work around it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Have you worked mostly on I B M,
B:	With P C they're either I B M or I B M compatible, mostly.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's that's all I've seen in offices, is I B M.
B:	That is the, you know, the industry standard.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	There's a lot of really good I B M compatibles, too.
B:	They don't have to necessarily be the I B M brand,
B:	but they have to adhere to that industry standard.
A:	Right.
A:	Well do you think it's been five minutes yet
A:	or,
B:	Oh, probably.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Well it was nice talking to you.
B:	Okay.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Okay.
B:	Are you a T I
A:	No.
B:	No.
B:	Is somebody in your family a T I
A:	No,
A:	and that's how he got it.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	so who do you work for?
A:	I just graduated from college.
B:	So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about.
A:	No.
B:	You're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
A:	Or, what I'm looking for.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	okay
B:	Well in, in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers?
A:	No,
A:	huh-uh.
B:	Didn't get that far.
A:	No.
B:	you normally just try to sell them on your, uh, aptitude and not, you know, well how much vacation do I get
B:	Oh well.
A:	Um.
B:	Well I'll tell you a little bit about what T I has as benefits.
B:	We do have, uh,
B:	like most companies, we have medical insurance.
B:	Although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more. Um, what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to, um, set hospitals in the area.
B:	They call it network hospitals.
B:	They're
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I've heard of that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're hospitals that they're, uh, agreeing with, uh, T I that they'll be a certain rate, you know, for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep you know, costs down.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors.
B:	So it's almost like a, um, uh, an H M O you know, kind of thing that, uh, only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have some dental coverage now, um,
B:	but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile.
B:	Like, I've had a couple of crowns recently
B:	and if you didn't have the extra dental plus, um, you only get like a third of your cost, which can be kind of expensive with a crown.
A:	Yeah
A:	it can .
B:	So, I, I pay,
B:	yeah,
B:	I pay for the extra dental plus, so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, we do have pension, although I've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good
B:	and I know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
A:	Oh, I like to think about that.
B:	After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there.
B:	I don't think's it's going to pay too long when I get out.
B:	Um, we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago, um,
B:	it's not an I R A,
B:	it's called a four oh one K plan.
B:	It's kind of like pension.
B:	You put in so much money
B:	and then, T I, um, meets you half way up to a certain maximum.
B:	So like I put in a dollar, they put in fifty cents.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, that grows pretty good
B:	and I think that will be more of something I can see of a pension than the regular pension plan.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Of course you can buy stock in the company,
B:	but, you know, that's not always a real, for sure kind of thing.
A:	Not always safe
B:	Yeah,
B:	especially with this one, you know, it kind of goes up and down.
B:	I don't know if it's any different than other companies,
B:	but you hate to have it fluctuate
B:	and like, you know, last year it was forty dollars a share
B:	and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share,
B:	and you go, gee, I'm losing money
B:	Doesn't quite feel as good.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we you know, vacation normally after you're here for six months
B:	and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you.
B:	And it's, one nice thing about T I is after you've been here, uh, for five years,  you get three weeks.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	Which, a lot of places make you work like ten years or so,  before you get that much.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we get some, we get, uh, decent holidays.
B:	Um, at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice, to make a nice long weekend.
B:	And at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas.
B:	They float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's nice, so you always get two days at Christmas.
B:	A lot of people just take, you know, that week,
B:	I normally take that week somehow, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You only have to take three days of vacation
B:	and you get the whole week at Christmas time.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, um, I can just tell you like, you know,
A:	Well there's twelve kids in my family.
B:	Whoa, okay!
A:	So the, the dental was very important, you know, to my dad.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, um, I think they took the dental away now.
A:	He worked for United Telephone System,
A:	it's, you know,  it's just another, you know telephone network.
B:	Um.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they took the dental away,
A:	but now I think they're going to start getting into eye.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I think, uh, um,
B:	I don't use the services
B:	but yeah, I think sometime last year, or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage.
B:	You get discounts on, uh, glasses
B:	and I'm not quite sure, there's certain places you can go to that have, uh, discounts for people that work here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock.  he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only,  for everything he puts in they'll match it, up to a certain amount.
B:	Yeah
A:	Like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then he's only allowed, I think, I don't know if it's maybe five percent, or something like that that he's allowed to put in
A:	and they'll match it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So and, um, he works for the,
A:	did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay,
A:	well he works for them.
A:	They changed their name now
A:	but that's, that's where he works
A:	and, um, he, his vacation is really nice.
A:	He's going to be there three years at the end of this month
A:	and he'll be getting three weeks vacation.
B:	Gee,
B:	that's pretty decent.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	you know, of course, it's a it's for the government
A:	and he has all, all the holidays off.
B:	Right,
B:	and you get some extra ones.
B:	Federal workers always seem to get,
B:	you know, you get Columbus Day, and Veterans Day,  and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow.
A:	Right,
A:	right
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	he has it really nice.
A:	It's nice where he works,
A:	and, um, he seems to be very happy, you know.
A:	Like his hospitalization
A:	and, you know, he has all that
A:	and with his doctors and stuff, they have, um, a list of doctors that the employees can go to
A:	and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	okay.
A:	You know, and I think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any.
A:	But you have to go, you know, to certain ones
A:	but still that works out really nice.
A:	You know, it,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we're doing an H M O right now, um,
B:	and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars,
B:	but,  you know, sometime, sometimes when you go, you know, the prescription,
A:	That's not bad either.
B:	like my husband always takes which is kind of like, you know, Contact stuff, only better.
B:	Um, you
B:	that's like a buck a capsule.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings.
B:	Then there's other times that, you know, maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars
B:	and you pay five anyhow.
B:	So it isn't a,
A:	Hi
A:	you want to start first
B:	Of course.
B:	We are talking about the elderly and, uh, whether or not we we like nursing homes
A:	Right.
B:	and, as a matter of fact, I can tell you something about that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You apparently have somebody there, in one.
B:	No,
B:	actually, my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
B:	and her mother,
A:	Oh, you are kidding?
B:	No,
B:	she did.
A:	Oh.
B:	And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home, for years. And then, uh, went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I will be darned.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.
A:	Oh, for heaven's sake.
B:	So, I do know something about that.
A:	You are very, very much aware of what goes on.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	That is great.
B:	Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business, was that her mother was very old, and couldn't seem to find companions.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	She was lonely.
A:	Right.
B:	And she needed company, for her mother
A:	Right.
B:	and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies.
A:	I will be darned.
B:	And then, uh, it, it grew into a, very prosperous business from that point.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, then they,
A:	Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.
B:	Well, that is not really true, either, uh,
B:	I think that is a stigma and an I, and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You see, those who had bad experiences talk about them.
A:	Uh, right,
A:	right.
B:	And those who do not may write, a letter to the nursing home and say you did good,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they do not talk a whole lot about that.
A:	That is true.
A:	But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home, when you are still able to have good, relationships with, maybe other friends they wait until they are, you know, unable.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Sure.
B:	Well now, That is right.
B:	Well, that is because they wait until the children make those choices, they choose to not make those, choices themselves.
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	However, my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home.
B:	And these, these,
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
B:	I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her. "Well I am going for my, tennis lessons.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, would would you, you know, call down and have the van come around and take, us for our tennis lessons."
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And they are very active and very enthusiastic
B:	and they have, some excellent programs right there on site.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is great.
B:	Or, or one of the lovely cafeterias.
B:	And they have, you know, pink linen napkins for their dinners. And, a well equipped library.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that sounds great.
B:	Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home
B:	and I think when the, the parent gets old enough, to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping house, and with taking care of themselves, anymore. That is a wonderful alternative.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It is expensive.
B:	It is costly.
A:	See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it is, you, know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, now my daddy's mother, uh, lived in a, a retirement village
B:	and she and her sister had side by side duplexes, one bedroom duplex.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She still had her individuality,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but they were there close
B:	and they did have, uh, you know, the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems
B:	and, there were lights that you could flip on and so forth.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And they have security.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	No,
B:	I am very much in favor,
B:	I have heard horror stories,
A:	Oh, well you have that with anything.
B:	I know that the elderly can easily be abused,
A:	Oh yeah .
B:	but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are, they are in, homes of their own children.
A:	In the homes, yeah.
A:	Well, we used our nursing home as, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	like when my sister was real bad before she died uh, we took her the last month and a half, into a nursing home.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they were super with her.
B:	Absolutely.
A:	They were, uh,
B:	Well now, my grandmother,
B:	of course all of my folks lived to be very old
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease, when she was in her late eighties, uh, late seventies, I mean.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She went to the doctor,
B:	she had surgery,
B:	she got the treatments
B:	and during, the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	She got better,
B:	she got well,
B:	she got out and went dancing again.
A:	Well, a lot of people do that.
A:	They , left them temporally maybe they had a, broken hip or something or,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That is right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I think it is a wonderful interim place,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital, problems
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and yet it is not, you know,
B:	you have,
A:	And it can become home to them.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	It, It depends upon the individual.
B:	It certainly is.
B:	It certainly does,
B:	but, you see, we have had excellent experience with that.
B:	And, uh, I, I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill,
B:	but, I would not object to going to one.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	I might, I might like to be, uh, coherent enough to make my own choice.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say, "well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and, then dump me there.
A:	This is
A:	and,
B:	But, I would like,
A:	There has to be consideration taken on everything.
B:	That is right.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	And I think you would shop for a nursing home, just like you would shop for a church, or a doctor or anything else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That is right,
A:	you would look into it thoroughly and, do, do the best job you could in choosing one.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	When you get to the point where you are in trouble, and you have got to have that help, you are in no position to make those choices.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	No
A:	and you do not have the time to look,
A:	that is what, I am saying,
B:	That is right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.
B:	Absolutely.
B:	I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day, and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft programs, perhaps, work on some music programs, whatever their talents are.  And work with, those senior citizens.
A:	Whatever their talents, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have a cousin who is, uh,
A:	she had a son that was epileptic from birth,
A:	and he did fine, at home,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they lived on a farm,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone, she did not want her, her children, her other children burdened with his care.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That is right.
A:	So he, they, she has made arrangements that when she, she was gone, that he would go into the nursing home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he has, I would say, he adjusted very well
A:	and, uh, he, he, he has been there quite a long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, he don't know me usually
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, he goes wheeling down, uh, the hall to bingo.
A:	Somebody else, is helping him out, you know,
B:	That is right.
B:	Uh. Well, one of the things, I think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine.
A:	and, uh, he has adjusted very well.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	oh yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	Routine and, uh, constancy.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh
B:	Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over.
B:	I do not think they pay, the nursing home staff sufficiently, to, to get the dedication that they have in some other profession,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	To keep them there, uh-huh.
A:	True.
B:	and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,
A:	Yes.
A:	But , for some reason people resist, uh, the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.
B:	And, uh,
B:	That is right.
A:	It seems to be a resistance.
B:	Care for the elderly and care for the children, I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, a more, uh, better area to invest, your money.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
A:	But there seems to be a resistance.
B:	You are preserving your heritage and your future there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	So, uh,
B:	And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes.
A:	Well, around here, we have some, you know, the churches, take your, the children
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, I know our kids thoroughly,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	the children thoroughly enjoy,
A:	Okay,
A:	my name is Karen.
B:	Okay,
B:	my name is Terry.
A:	Okay,
A:	and this, uh,
A:	they said about magazines.
A:	We, I've probably personally take I think just two
B:	Okay.
A:	but that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me, a month later
A:	so. So I get all of them.
A:	Uh, the one that I really especially enjoy,
A:	and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin, is called COUNTRY.
B:	Oh, yes, uh,
B:	there's COUNTRY LIVING,
B:	there's COUNTRY,
B:	and, uh,
A:	Well, this,
A:	yeah,
A:	this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live, like Wisconsin
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things.
B:	Sure.
A:	And I get that, it has recipes in it,
A:	and that's my very favorite.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	What do you take?
B:	Well, I actually take COUNTRY LIVING,
B:	it's a country magazine on HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, because I like, um that kind of stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	decorating.
B:	Decorating and, uh, getting ideas for a garden.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	In fact, uh, right before you called, I was planning my tulips and, uh, putting them on blue print on where I'm going to put them,
A:	Are you?
B:	so I'm really into that,
A:	Oh.
B:	but, uh, so, I really get into magazines that are kind of basically into, um, housing type things, where the, be decorating and gardening and recipes, that kind of stuff.
A:	And decorating and how to do things.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we, we tried for a while to take a news magazine.
A:	We took NEWSWEEK
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested.
B:	Sure.
A:	But we've kind of discontinued that right now
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we've, we're going to start taking that, uh, U S NEWS, uh, newspaper. U S A TODAY,
A:	I think it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	I've had TIME before.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think with that what happens is, uh, it's interesting to read
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you kind of just put the magazine away
B:	and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids,
A:	That's right.
B:	but,
A:	That's exactly right.
A:	I did the same thing.
A:	We saved the ones from the election
A:	and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake.
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly it sounds exactly like what we did
A:	And then
A:	and,
B:	we just saved everything we could for our daughter
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh that's pretty similar,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but I find that with these COUNTRY magazines, I keep going back to them, getting ideas, looking back and saying, Jeez, there was a flower garden in there that I , that I would like to have some ideas, you know
A:	Well, you sound like you, That's the thing, you sound like you have the facilities to do that.
B:	I get a lot of ideas from them.
B:	Yes,
B:	we do.
B:	We're out in the country
A:	Oh.
B:	we're right across from a river,
B:	and uh, you're right, the leaves are beautiful,
B:	and they are falling now,
B:	so.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh, it just peaked, uh, last week,
B:	and it was just gorgeous out here,
B:	but.
A:	I bet it is gorgeous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's beautiful.
B:	The other thing about magazines, the only thing I don't like, is they really get heavily into advertising
A:	I agree,
B:	and, you know, it's, it's, it's fine,
B:	I'd rather almost have
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I know that part, probably half their money comes from these people that are saying, uh, Put my ad in your paper and I'll pay you or whatever,
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	but, uh, there's been some magazines I've looked at,
B:	and it's a real turn off to see every other page,  some kind of ad,
A:	Every page.
A:	I do the same thing,
A:	I, I think I opened VOGUE the other day or something
B:	Yeah,
B:	VOGUE is,  heavily into that.
A:	and it was just nothing, uh-huh.
A:	And I thought, Why buy this?
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly,
B:	it's almost
A:	You know, what's the point?
B:	I mean, you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way,
A:	That's right.
A:	And my number one pet peeve in a magazine, is when they put the perfume in it because, uh, real often, I don't like very heavy perfumes
B:	Yeah,
B:	exactly.
A:	and very often, like, you know, in my bills, also, magazines and bills, and they'll, come out just stinking the whole thing.
B:	Exactly,
B:	yeah,
B:	they're really getting into that
B:	so,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But pretty much like I said, the magazines I've had, BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN,
B:	and now I need a switch,
B:	and I'm going back to GOURMET COOKING, because, um, I've had the magazine before, back in nineteen, uh, eighty-six,
A:	Oh.
B:	and I thought, Well, I'll give it a try again, because you get tired of one magazine,
B:	and you need to try a change.
A:	I understand.
A:	Well, do you , do you tear out of your magazines, your recipes
A:	or do you keep it?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I do,
B:	and sometimes, most of the time I tear them out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	A lot of times, if, uh, you know, if I got a chance to sit down at my typewriter, I'll go ahead and type out recipes,
B:	but what I usually do is I'll try it out in the magazine first, and, without tearing it out, and then give it a,
A:	Type it out, uh-huh.
A:	See how the family liked it
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection,
B:	but, uh.
A:	Oh, that's a good idea.
A:	Well, I'm going to pay attention more when I'm in the store to that COUNTRY LIVING, I remember seeing the cover.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Back when I decorated the house with a lot of the little country, uh, primitive things, the little, the little pigs and the jeez, and the ducks, and that, we had, that was the big rage here, couple of years ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I bought a lot of the country magazines
B:	Sure,
B:	sure.
A:	and then it seems like when I put some of that away, I quit buying it,
A:	but I had forgotten the recipes
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I'm going to,
A:	I'll have to check that out,
B:	Yeah,
B:	it, it, that's what I, I just went through, uh
B:	we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I went through all this,
B:	I had this huge stack of HOUSE BEAUTIFUL
B:	I had COLONIAL TIMES,
B:	I had GOURMET
A:	And you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one
B:	yeah.
B:	It was hard,
B:	but I ended up, uh, reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of, uh hundreds.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	And I just said, Okay, there's one picture in there that,
B:	it really doesn't, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's got to have more than that
A:	right.
B:	it's got to have some good ideas
A:	Right.
B:	it's got to have everything.
B:	So I just kind of went through,
B:	and I find that most of the magazines I really like is around Christmas time because,
A:	I, I know,
A:	Okay,
A:	basically I can tell you that I like just about every music there is except for, uh, uh, real hard, hard rock,
A:	I really can't get into that
A:	but I go from classical all the way to, uh, jazz and country and uh, soft pop, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I pretty much have a, a wide range of, uh, what I like,
A:	and just, there isn't any particular music that I enjoy more than just listening to all kinds
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	so that's about it.
A:	I can even take the
A:	now, it's, it's pretty neat music that they came out with,
A:	so.
B:	I'm pretty much the same way,
B:	but there's like certain types of country western I can't handle that twangy stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure,
A:	the old, old stuff that came out, I think it was, was it, oh, jeez, came out with some of that, Hank Williams,
A:	you talk about twangy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My in-laws listen to the kind of music I hate
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	the old, old country,
A:	Yeah.
B:	But other than that, I like pretty much everything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's the way I am, too,
A:	so, other than, uh,
A:	as far as instruments, I can go from piano to the saxophone.
A:	Lately, you know, with the new music that has come out, some of the really good, uh, music they have the saxophone playing,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it's so funny, because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	to Oops, are you okay, Tiana, come here honey.
A:	talking to Oh, my daughter just fell.
B:	Do you like Kenny G?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	a little bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can, I can pretty much, to
A:	Oh, it's all wet, Tiana.
A:	talking to I just wiped, uh, did the floor,
A:	and she slipped.
B:	On,
B:	no.
A:	Anyway, but, uh, um, yeah,
A:	I can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get, like I said, into the real hard rock,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the heavy metal,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I have no interest in that,
A:	I, I don't have interest of losing my ears,
A:	let's just put it that way, hearing, anyway,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I saw Peter Townsend on T V last night,
B:	and he said he's lost most of his hearing
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	sure.
B:	and I thought, no wonder
B:	so.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	exactly.
B:	Um.
A:	Okay,
A:	well it was good talking to you then.
B:	Well, same here.
A:	Okay.
B:	You all have a good day.
A:	You, too.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye now.
A:	Okay,
A:	Scott, let's, uh, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you have any?
A:	and,
B:	Do you have any kids
B:	or,
A:	I have some, yes, some children.
A:	I have three boys.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they're all quite young
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so we want to plan for their education
A:	or we're saving right now
A:	and we're getting bonds, and, and, uh, and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to.
A:	How about yourself?
A:	Do you have any kids?
B:	No,
B:	I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now
A:	So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	definitely.
B:	In fact, I'm even going, uh, selecting again for, for my P H D.
B:	It's, it's a close subject right now
A:	Very good.
B:	Uh,
A:	What, uh, what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to?
B:	Well I use, uh, uh, uh, I have used, uh, several techniques depending on what,
B:	for undergraduate, I, I, you know, my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, when I, when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know, rather small and easy to get around, you know. And what I would, what I thought would be easy to get through.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
A:	what you thought, huh.
B:	Yeah
B:	And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you know, it changed a whole lot.
B:	I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh, graduate with a little, you know, with a name behind me, rather than, uh
A:	Just the degree itself.
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, that's a, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable that you didn't have a lecture, uh, hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, but you, I felt that I got a pretty good, uh, undergraduate, uh,
B:	Where, where did you go?
A:	I went to Utah State University which is in Logan, Utah
B:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the nice thing about it too is, I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their business, College of Business, was accredited
A:	and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I, I feel like, number one, you you also need to see what kind of name the,
A:	like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you and another thing that, uh, another reason why I chose that was the, the finances.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through four, three years of the undergraduate work and, and have to leave.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family with, uh, counselors at high school, and also read some, some books on, on the subject at the, at the library.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it was kind of unusual because my, my two older brothers and I all went to three different universities, depending on what our choice was.
A:	So.
B:	Right.
A:	Hopefully we, we chose the one that was best for us,
A:	and I, I felt very comfortable and good about that.
A:	So.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able,
B:	I mean, obviously you've taken precautions, you know, or measures to, uh, try and pay for your children's education,
B:	but do you think that that's going to be enough?
A:	I don't think so.
B:	No.
A:	I don't know.
A:	The, the way that tuition is increasing, um, exponentially it's, it's, it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh,
B:	I, all I, all I can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy university.
A:	And that, that your children can use the benefits of that university.
B:	Yeah
A:	Well, that's an excellent idea,
A:	that's an excellent idea.
A:	One thing that, uh, that we did, uh, and my parents, and our family, is that we weren't able to afford, um, the kind of education that we all desired.
A:	So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and and save and, and, and get.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Also, my, my brother, um, he's a, he's a medical doctor right now.
A:	He had to, you know,
A:	once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had to take out some loans,
A:	and he's, he's working to pay those off.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial stages of it, that there's different options you can use
A:	and, and, uh the student loans are, are good options.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what, that's my biggest option right now.
A:	Yeah
A:	Yes,
A:	and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not,
A:	So, what do you think about a year or two of public service?
B:	Well, I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years, you know, their carefree years
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but people that I have known that have done that, like from other countries, especially, from Germany and Finland, um, they are just, they have such a better, more mature, outlook on life
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and I think they're better people because of it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they're much more responsible.
B:	I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work,
B:	and I I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.
A:	You know, I, I really agree with you.
A:	Um, I, uh, though I've never done that myself, I, I'm, was a basically an education major when I graduated from college
A:	and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to, um, very rural children in a very low income district
A:	and I spent a year teaching there
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I did it, um, for one reason I wanted,
A:	I was working on a masters degree
A:	so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I,
A:	it changed, it probably changed my political views
A:	it changed my understanding of the world around me
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I think, um, in fact, if I had to do it all again I, you know,
A:	after that, you know, you never think of it because, I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.
B:	Huh.
A:	Um, so that was, that was one reason why I never considered it
A:	but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans, I, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,
B:	Yeah.
A:	um, I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
B:	Huh. and rattling in
A:	and I thought that was, you know, very interesting
A:	and I, I would have thought of that earlier
A:	I probably would have done, you know, just like, is that, is this, is that the Mormon church, that does that?
B:	Yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	Because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought, you know, that really,
A:	now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have,
A:	probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I think so,
B:	it puts you out on your own
B:	and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And I think, you know, we have such a need now, you know,
A:	I taught, you know,
A:	I, I think I was paid, uh, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I worked in a very rural school district
A:	and I, I, one of the things I taught was a computer class
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and these kids, um, you know, every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Many of the boys in the room had children
A:	and they were, they were high school juniors.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I just,
A:	there, you know, they came from poverty,
A:	they were going to condition in poverty
A:	and it was, it was, the school district couldn't hire many people,
A:	it was very difficult for them to hire,
A:	and I think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, um, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, um, things, I think it's a really good idea. And even if it is overseas.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	See, I never,
A:	I, I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
B:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It would really, um,
B:	and I don't
B:	the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
B:	but it's, it has helped them
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and like she's washing
A:	Yeah.
A:	I think it would also help them if they then went on to college.
A:	I know that my first couple of years of college were, um, uh, probably too carefree at the, beginning
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then at the end I had to be too serious.
B:	Well, that's right.
B:	A lot of people they flunk out
B:	or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	and,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	that's right.
B:	Um.
A:	I,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think, I think this was, this was a very interesting topic uh, because it's something that, you know, we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, you know,
B:	because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Is that what it was?
B:	I do some, I'm a graduate student in Psych.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	And we sort of, you know, figure out,
B:	um, I know a little bit about that kind of stuff.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	What they're trying to do there is, they want to sort of get a base line measure for you, you know.
B:	How is it that when you see these things and, you know,  and, and, and,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Kind of get,  Kind of get something to measure my responses by.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping,  around and being fidgety,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Maybe .
B:	It can be shocking
B:	and,  shock you.
A:	Yeah
A:	they ask why I was going,
A:	what in the world are you asking me about here. But I guess, I don't know, some people have probably killed their mothers.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I guess so,
B:	I mean, I guess, I don't know how, what actually happens if, uh, if you have killed your mother
A:	Yeah
B:	Big jump there. But, yeah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think it's their way of saying how well you do,  in a shock situation without worrying about,  stuff like that.
A:	Huh-uh.  I never thought about that,
A:	that makes me feel a little better
A:	Of course, that was years and years ago.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and I don't think that you killed your mother though,
B:	I wouldn't worry about that.
A:	because in society a lot of people are taking drugs.
A:	There is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives.
A:	But they take a lie detector test or a drug test, or whatever
A:	and the stuff that happened to them, you know, five years ago comes up
A:	and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better.
A:	You know, when they might be actually trying to,  improve their lives.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's, uh, you know, it, it could blow things right away for them, you know.
A:	Huh-uh. Huh-uh.
B:	Unless they say, well, look, unless they walk in, they could walk in and say, look, I did do drugs a year ago,
B:	and I'm off them for a year now.
B:	I'll be happy to take the test,
B:	but it will show up positive.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	versus,
A:	I would probably do that.
A:	And I would probably bring something in showing that I had been to such and such hospital for help or, you know,  Whatever the twelve month program.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Or whatever it is that they do.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Because, I mean then, although then, they can't legally discriminate, I think on the basis .
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But I don't really know.
B:	I don't know what the laws are pertaining to this.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My wife probably does.
A:	I'm not sure what they are either.
B:	I don't, I don't .
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, it's an interesting topic that I never actually thought about .
A:	Yeah.
A:	The other day we had talked about, uh, capital punishment.
B:	Oh, I .
A:	And I really, really hadn't thought about it.
A:	I mean, I think about it because I hear about it,
A:	but I hadn't had to sit down and, and well, what do I think about it
A:	You know, and that's kind of like today.
A:	I'm not real sure what I think about it.
A:	I'm kind of, you know, in the middle on that one.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, these are tough.
B:	I sort of like that stuff,
B:	it makes you think.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Really,
A:	really.
B:	So I think that's real good.
A:	Okay.
A:	It was very nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you to.
A:	Okay.
A:	Take care.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, I think we pay too much in taxes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, I think they waste what we pay.
A:	Excuse me?
B:	I think they waste what, all the money that we pay
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what I think too.
A:	I don't know how you feel, um,
A:	we moved here from another state.
A:	We lived here before, went out and came back,
A:	and that particular state had an occupational income tax, but no sales tax.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what you find out is, there's, one evil is the same as the other.
A:	Here you don't, there's no occupational tax
A:	but it's a heavy sales tax.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So they get you coming and going.
B:	Now it's even, it's even higher in Dallas County,
B:	so.
B:	Was it. *listen
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's really, I know, it's just, um.
B:	It's eight and a quarter I think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is.
A:	I was shocked.
A:	I went,
A:	we bought a new washer
A:	and the man said, and that's eight percent.
A:	I said, eight percent. What
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So it's really kind of sad,
A:	yeah.
A:	And then I don't know how, you know, in terms of when you all do your federal,
A:	but it just seems like, if you're strictly middle income, it seems like you get hit the worst.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is that what you think?
B:	Yeah,
B:	because it's, at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent
B:	and then the people that make, you know, five hundred thousand dollars and, and, and higher than that, they don't have to pay,
B:	and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes.
A:	Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?
B:	No,
B:	it isn't.
A:	Because they have the money to shelter things
A:	and, I don't know, somehow get a, huh
B:	What?
A:	Oh, I thought you were going to say something.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	They somehow seem to get around these,
A:	the things that we can't, you know,
A:	that make, don't make that kind of money.
B:	Right.
A:	I don't know.
B:	I mean, if they're in business, and, and they're making money,
B:	I could see if they're losing money,
B:	but they're making money
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	then they should pay taxes then.
A:	I know,
A:	and just somehow it doesn't seem, you know,
A:	and then, I, you
A:	mean you look at like, uh, that country singer, uh, what's his name, Willie Nelson.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Some, he didn't look that stupid.
A:	Why didn't he pay his taxes? You know. *listen
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, uh, filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know.
B:	Right.
A:	So. Do you file federal or joint income tax, And do you feel like you get hit by, you know, too much?
B:	I just file federal income tax every year.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just got divorced,
B:	so I'm single again.
B:	So, and you know, it's, it's a lot worse for single people, because they pay the same amount as, as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we, right now, we don't own any property.
A:	We lease.
A:	So we're in the same,
A:	we don't have children,
A:	so we're in the same kind of,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's not as bad as being single and divorced,
A:	but it's sort of like, if you have like X point five children and earn, you know, you kind of get hit with, you know,
A:	I, I mean, it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage, because,
A:	doesn't that sound stupid.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I mean, there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full time compared to what my husband does, you know. *are the final "you knows" tags?
B:	Right.
A:	So it's kind of hard.
B:	Whoever works less, they can get a tax credit for that.
A:	Excuse me.
B:	If both of the, both of the spouses work, then you get a tax credit for that.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	otherwise you're just, you know,
A:	and if you have kids, you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something
B:	Well, it's two thousand now.
A:	Oh, it is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	for everybody.
A:	Oh, my.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well that's not too bad.
B:	Then you get a, you get a child care exemption,
B:	but it's not enough, you know.
B:	I mean, you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and they only give you like, I think it's about five or ten percent of that.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	You know, it doesn't even, it's not even,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess that's my call.
A:	I guess I better go
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Okay,
A:	well it was nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	bye-bye.
A:	What part of the country are you in?
B:	Uh, Pennsylvania.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, you are?
A:	East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh. *listen
B:	Oh, are you really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	What part of Pittsburgh?
A:	Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County .
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, where are you from?
B:	Uh, Clarion County.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	I know where that is.
B:	I we live out in the country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's pretty out there.
A:	What, well,
B:	Yeah,
B:	we have, we have two children that live in Pittsburgh
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	yeah,
A:	I got my brother and my whole family there.
A:	I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.
B:	Oh, oh, you are?
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then?
A:	No,
A:	my husband does.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And who, how about you?
B:	No,
B:	I'm just, Uh, federal company, you know,
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
B:	so, yeah.
A:	Well that's okay.
A:	I guess it's an easy thing to do.
A:	So you're you have a big,
A:	do you have a rural house or what do you have?
B:	Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know, remodeled.
A:	Oh, that's a,
A:	Those are beautiful.
B:	It had been, you know, of course, a farm.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a farm community,
B:	and we.
A:	Yeah,
A:	is it a, is it a working farm
A:	or is it?
B:	Ours is not a working farm
A:	More, more,
A:	I can understand that,
A:	that's probably what I would, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I have a garden
B:	but you know,
B:	we have a garden.
A:	Yeah
B:	But we don't farm.
A:	I can hear the accent now
A:	I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, we originally lived in Dallas
A:	and we met and got married
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh,
A:	and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	at any rate we came back here with,
A:	my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano,
A:	well, it's not little any more.
B:	Uh, Grapevine,
B:	do you know Grapevine?
A:	Uh, yes,
A:	that's out near the airport.
A:	That's about forty-five miles from us.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my brother has a home there he's trying to sell.
B:	He, he's living now up, uh, in, in Maryland
B:	but, uh, he, lived in Grapevine for a long time.
A:	It's,
A:	yeah,
A:	That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt?
A:	Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit?
A:	and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick
A:	but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
B:	Oh, it's terrible.
B:	I,
A:	It really is,
A:	I mean we're, we're in a leased town home,
A:	and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
B:	Oh, I'm not surprised.
A:	But, you know what,
A:	if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
B:	Uh, right,
B:	right.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it's not good
A:	No.
B:	And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
B:	but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live
B:	and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice,
B:	they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,
A:	Yeah
A:	this is, it's like a duplex,
A:	like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh, Uh-huh.
A:	And it's nice
A:	but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten,
A:	and now she can't sell it.
A:	And our neighbors,
B:	Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
B:	Oh, my heaven.
A:	That's how bad it,
A:	I know.
B:	Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
A:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	yeah.
A:	I have some friends that live in Westport
A:	and it's really, really bad.
A:	I mean you,
B:	But we like our area.
B:	It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh,
A:	How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually,
A:	because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania
B:	Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh north.
A:	That's not too bad.
A:	That's north.
B:	And yeah,
B:	and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
A:	Are you going up toward, uh, uh,
A:	I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M,
A:	Bradford, no that's too far north.
B:	Bradford's north of us.
A:	So you're, you're not that far north then,
A:	okay.
B:	No,
B:	no.
A:	Well, you're really not too bad.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years,
A:	or that you've,
B:	Well, we've been here since sixty-six.
A:	Oh, then you have,
A:	yeah.
A:	Do you have a lot of land
A:	or,
B:	Uh, we have fifty acres.
A:	Oh, my,
A:	well, then.
B:	Oh, pardon me,
B:	we have forty,
B:	we gave ten to one of our children
A:	There you go.
A:	Did you have a hard time getting used to,
A:	do you feel like you live in an isolated area
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	not really,
B:	and, and towns keep creeping closer and closer, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that that's, um,
A:	I can remember in Pittsburgh when,
A:	this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly
A:	but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and now it's it's a terrible connection.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's ours up here.
B:	We have,
B:	our rural connections are real bad
A:	Oh, well that's okay, um,
B:	But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, you know, reasonable.
A:	But, but,
A:	yeah,
A:	substantially, you know.
A:	Um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
B:	Uh, yeah,
B:	we're tired of doing it though.
B:	We, we don't want to do too much more
A:	How big is it?
A:	How many square feet do you have?
B:	Uh, oh, golly,
B:	I really.
A:	Well how many rooms do you think,
A:	yeah?
B:	We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh
B:	we, have a half bath downstairs, too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room
B:	And, uh,
A:	A junk room,
A:	yeah
A:	I understand,
A:	we have that too.
A:	That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
B:	Pardon?
A:	That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
B:	Well, it really isn't too big yet.
B:	We, we
B:	a lot of people say that
B:	but, um, it's,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we just like it real well Yeah,
A:	It's enough space for two people
A:	Yeah.
B:	we had five children,
B:	so and they've all moved you know, on.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	They're all out on their own now.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	That's okay.
A:	Well, we've got, um,
A:	this town house is pretty big.
A:	It's about eighteen hundred square feet.
A:	It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, it's really nice.
B:	Well, it sounds like a good buy.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it is,
A:	I mean, I would never buy it
A:	but leasing it is fine.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know.
A:	Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres,
A:	and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
B:	Oh, that makes a big difference.
A:	right,
A:	near Dayton, Ohio,
A:	and he said, you know,
A:	he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You really aren't isolated because it's,
B:	the advantages,
B:	your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people,
A:	Right.
B:	but yet you can have your friends, uh,
B:	you can have them in,
B:	you can go out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You have more of a choice,
B:	you're not pressed upon as bad.
A:	That's kind of what, like
A:	his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it is too far south for me,
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um,
A:	when they said log cabin, I just laughed,
A:	that they retired to,
A:	but they built one of these.
A:	I mean, it's just beautiful.
A:	It's like a custom, you know
A:	it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins.
A:	You know, I mean, it's modern
A:	it's,
B:	More luxury.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Right,
A:	right,
A:	it's modern,
A:	it's beautiful,
A:	it's country
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	it's you know, um,
A:	but, uh, I don't,
A:	what else about housing except it's, uh, well,
A:	Pittsburgh's housing economy, I think it's holding it's own.
B:	Uh, they're,
B:	yeah,
B:	I suppose they are now.
B:	We,
B:	both of our children who live there have just bought a home. Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area.
A:	What part, what sections are they in?
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's nice.
B:	And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable.
B:	They didn't have to do much to it.
A:	Great.
B:	The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done.
B:	It's twenty years old, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, but they have two children, too,
B:	and they, they bought what they could afford.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's,
A:	yeah,
A:	a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills,
A:	and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, it's, it's, you know,
A:	they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, but it's a beautiful home
A:	and, I mean, my brother lives,
B:	They are beautiful homes.
A:	is it called Baldwin or Bebble?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um,
A:	it's real pretty up there.
A:	It's just,
B:	It is,
B:	it's real nice.
A:	And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's, uh,
A:	when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
B:	Oh, my
B:	you you do when you
B:	When we first got married, uh,
B:	my husband works for the state,
B:	and we moved once a year usually
A:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's what it is here,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's why we're at a point now we've, uh, we're adopting
A:	and we have been married ten plus years
A:	and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in Yeah,
B:	Right, yeah,
B:	you have to stop some place,
B:	yeah.
A:	that's kind of like where we're,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so we're considering Pennsylvania,
A:	and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
B:	Uh-huh. I do too,
A:	A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house
A:	and, but I disagree with that,
A:	I.
B:	I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, they buy a place
B:	and they just hate the area.
A:	I know,
A:	and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady,
A:	but it's still not going up.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
A:	Oh, I'm sure,
A:	yeah,
A:	there, I mean, you can go down a street,
A:	and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
B:	Right,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	um, it's really, I mean,
A:	and, and it's hard to sell the properties.
A:	People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
B:	I, I couldn't handle that
A:	Yeah,
A:	I know,
A:	and that's, you know, like
A:	I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, it's across the way,
A:	and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
B:	I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, because we mow, you know, a good bit of ground around the house area.
A:	Yeah
A:	but you have a rider.
B:	And I do get tired of that
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	I don't think I'd want to change it.
A:	No,
A:	and your kids have,
A:	to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
B:	Hello.
A:	Hi, uh,
A:	basically, I wear pants.
A:	I'm a real pants person
A:	and, uh, like when I'm at home since,
A:	and I'll say, I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, uh,
A:	I wear a pantsuit most of the time.
A:	Not a pantsuit,
A:	I guess pants and a shirt
A:	and, uh, in the summertime I wear cotton tops.
A:	Cotton top shirts
A:	and in the winter I wear, uh, like sweaters.
A:	I like sweaters a lot.
A:	And so I do that.
A:	But when I go out for meetings uh, then I will wear either, uh, skirts or, uh, a dress
A:	and I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time,
A:	but, that's basically what I do.
B:	Well, I think our tastes are fairly similar,
B:	although I am I government worker, I do tend to,
B:	I'm, uh, a scientist.
A:	Oh.
B:	So that technically,
B:	I suppose, I could get away with, with extremely casual clothes,
B:	but, for the most port, part I don't.
B:	I wear fairly respectable looking shoes
B:	and and a pantsuit of one sort or another
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, I guess dress it up with a, with a, a very nice black jacket when I have, have visitors or have to give talks.
A:	Well, that sounds nice.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, it said the seasons,
A:	do, do you change much through the season
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	actually I guess this summer I, I wore some fairly nice jeans uh, more than I have in previous seasons.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, no,
B:	I tend to, to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer.
B:	I don't know whether they think by, you know, freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during the day or something.
A:	Maybe.
B:	But but, you know, you wear a heavy sweater in your office, all summer.
A:	No.
B:	So, right,
B:	uh, yeah,
B:	I don't, I don't, I, you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of, of secretaries was, you know, overdress, over kill, sort of
A:	Yeah.
B:	and in a in a sense, the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would, would be to spend this money here
A:	Right.
B:	You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up.
A:	Then
A:	Uh, well, I don't have the resources to just go out and buy, buy, buy anyway
A:	and so my don't change dramatically over the years.
A:	If I need something new, I will go and buy it.
A:	But, basically I'm a, a pretty much the same
A:	in the summertime I wear the light cotton
A:	and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And, so, it's not a whole lot of, of change for me either.
A:	And, uh, especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses
A:	I, I, I enjoy that,
A:	but it just wouldn't be, uh, smart for me to do that in my home with my children.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I have to, uh, think about things like that, too.
A:	I have given seminars before in, in creative writing and things like that.
A:	Now, I don't know if they consider that a job.
A:	I don't really get paid for that, uh, often,
A:	but, uh, when I do that then I, I think I become more businesslike.
A:	Uh, but it doesn't really change my clothing style.
B:	Exactly.
B:	I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a the same pant suit you would, you know wear for other things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm, I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics.
A:	Oh.
B:	And so I used to have a problem when, when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, dear.
A:	That's not helpful.
B:	right.
B:	But otherwise, now, I'm, I guess we're both pretty practical
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess so
A:	Well, it's been great talking to you.
B:	Okay.
A:	Have a great day.
B:	Well, have a good day.
A:	Bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	What do you think?
B:	Well, uh, this is, this is about drug testing right?
A:	Right.
B:	Well, uh, I'm, I'm certainly under the, uh, uh, the influence of the idea that, that the government needs to have less control on what, uh, what the citizens do,
B:	although I do see this as a, uh, something that definitely needs to be taken care of.
B:	Whether that, whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the, the hands of the, hands of the government is a, you know, a, a different question I think, as far as I'm concerned.
B:	in, in other words, I am in favor of drug or, or, or drug testing.
B:	Uh, I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I.
B:	Yet but, but at the same time, I don't think, uh, that should be governed by by the government, uh, per se.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it should be more by the private institution.
B:	How about you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think that the corporations should, uh, do all that.
A:	They should, uh, have drug screening before they hire an employee
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, any time that an employee,
A:	like if they're coming to late work all the time and, uh if they, if they're, especially if there's they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where, you know, if they can, if they made a mistake, it would cost a lot of money or
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I agree with you.
B:	I, you know, I would even think that, uh, uh, I could, in theory take that a a, you know, a step further and say anybody in any job, you know, if the corporation felt like, uh,
B:	and this is why, I mean, uh, drugs are the biggest problem, I think to face America today.
B:	I mean it's what drives crime,
B:	it's what drives, uh, uh, any sort of, of, uh, uh, pain and discomfort in the world, or in America I think is is somewhat, uh, uh, driven by drugs
B:	and I think that, uh, were corporations and, uh, private industry to take, uh, take command in this situation, that maybe, maybe we might have some, some control over that.
B:	We, you know,
B:	if you can't work, then you can't be a little bit harder to take, take drugs or whatever,
B:	I don't know.
B:	Course, that might up crime, you know, when, uh, people go in and steal your television and and sell it just because they can't, they can't work anymore, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	but you got to have a, a safe work place.
A:	That's all there is to it.
B:	Definitely,
B:	you, you're definitely right.
B:	That, uh, you can't, you can't have it any other way.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, you know, whether whether in, in the case that you brought up, you know, whether, uh, you know,
B:	if it's a policeman and he's working with, uh, the public and he has a, and has a gun in his holster or, or even, you know, if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, they're dangerous in either situation.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I,
B:	what, what do you think, uh,
B:	what percentage of, of corporations and, uh, private industry do you think use, uh, drug testing?
A:	I think it's, it's more frequent now.
A:	It's probably like forty, fifty percent.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because, uh, all the jobs that I've applied for have, uh, mentioned some type of drug screening. Uh, I work at Sears.
B:	Right.
B:	What kind of work are you in?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I just do warehouse work.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	and did they give you drug testing?
A:	Uh, not,
A:	they hired me in nineteen eighty-four
B:	Oh.
B:	Okay.
A:	But now they, they, uh, they issued a statement about that, about three months ago.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, so are they going to, uh, begin spontaneous, uh, drug testing?
A:	Uh, not that I know of.
A:	It was more about, uh, all the people's problems.
A:	Like they've been laying off a lot of people.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh, and, uh, they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem.
B:	Sure.
A:	Family problems, you know. They kind of covered everything.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I know they have a lot of drug problems
A:	so,
B:	Yeah.
B:	What do you think about, uh, you know,
B:	something that kind of concerns me is, uh, you know, you and I are tested for, for whatever work we happen to do.
B:	Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials?
A:	Yes,
A:	I do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I do, too.
A:	Because, because a lot of them are, you know, they're hypocritical.
A:	They, they talk against drugs
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then they get caught, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	In stings in Washington. *one utt with a.61
B:	Yeah.
A:	Whether it's drugs or any other kind of, uh,
A:	like the, the money laundering scams. All that was drug related.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, and that cost us, the country, you know, billions of dollars.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure,
B:	yeah.
A:	So,
B:	I would agree with you.
B:	I, I can't see, I can't see how we can expect the, you know, uh, uh, people working in the, in, in America to, uh, to put any trust into our political officials if they don't, you know, uh,
B:	just doesn't make sense to have them to, to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves.
A:	Doug, you want to start?
B:	Sure.
A:	You don't use any credit cards, I don't imagine.
B:	No.
B:	Of course I use, credit cards.
B:	I have a couple of credit cards and, uh, use them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	do you use them a lot?
B:	Oh, we try not to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We're on a pretty strict and tight budget.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We use the credit cards, however, when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or we use credit cards also, if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing.
B:	So. So, yes,
A:	Oh, well, that's an idea,
A:	that's a thought,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where, you know, they don't take local, they don't take out of state checks
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so when we're traveling some.
B:	Do you use credit cards often?
A:	My husband loves them
A:	Uh, we do use them.
A:	Uh, we try not to,
A:	but, he, he's one who believes in credit cards,
A:	and he uses them quite a bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	well that's, that's a good thing, because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month
A:	He, he likes that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they just pay the minimum required balance.
A:	And that's when you get into expenses.
B:	Yes,
B:	and you get in over your head.
A:	Right.
B:	It'll, uh,
B:	some people I know also try to use it as float where they buy something now
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and say, well, I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale
B:	and then I can go ahead and pay for it when I get my check at the end of the month
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	when I'm being paid.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, sometimes you do come on bargains and that,
A:	and it's really useful.
B:	That's true.
A:	And some places won't take, you know, like personal checks or cash, even
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but they would take a credit card.
B:	Right.
B:	How how are the laws in Pennsylvania, uh, as, as regard, well not the laws, but the rates, credit card rates in Pennsylvania?
B:	For example down here, when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Are they the same there?
A:	We,
A:	yeah,
A:	we have the same thing up here,
A:	so we don't deal where they do that
A:	We you know, we go to places where they don't charge extra.
A:	Some of them charge five cents a gallon, even,
A:	like the gas stations more,
B:	That's pretty steep.
A:	And, uh, we just try to avoid, you know, the ones that do that,
A:	we just don't, uh, go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything
B:	Yes.
A:	extra because actually, to me, credit cards are the same as cash,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	to me they are, anyway,
B:	Yes,
B:	because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase
B:	and, and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry
A:	Right.
A:	Right,
A:	yeah.
A:	Yes.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	Very good.
B:	You're, you're one of the good, I guess, good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money.
A:	Well, I can't say we never have.
A:	Now we have, you know, at times, made payments on our things,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but we try not to.
A:	We try hard,
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	well, I see that as an advantage to a credit card, also
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	because sometimes, uh, there's times when you may, maybe couldn't take advantage of something
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but with a credit card you can.
A:	So.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, do you have, uh, multiple credit cards?
A:	Uh.
B:	And do you find that advantageous
B:	or,
A:	Well, I think we're narrowing it down, actually.
A:	Uh, uh, like I said, my husband likes them,
A:	and we have quite a few,
A:	but we really get, when you get down to the nitty gritty, there's probably three that we use most of the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	We're, we're actually in the same boat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We like to use three, uh, basic credit cards.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That way we're not confused
B:	and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And, do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail?
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Once a week,
B:	twice a week,
B:	or three times a week.
A:	Well, it's not every week,
A:	but you, you do get them.
A:	They make it very readily available.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Almost too much so.
A:	But I I really don't like it the charges that, you know,
A:	we try to limit, look at that also,
A:	what they charge per year to use our money, you know
B:	Right,
B:	so the annual fee.
B:	Right,
B:	right,
A:	they're charging us to spend our money,
A:	and, I, I'm not real crazy about that,
A:	so we try to look at that also.
B:	Yes,
B:	so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent uh, based upon what the state will allow,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	Right.
A:	Okay,
A:	Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.
B:	Good.
A:	Did you hear the questions that the lady, uh, brought up?
B:	Yes.
A:	Such as how much time, well,
A:	I'll ask,
A:	how much time do you spend with your children,
A:	and how many do you have?
B:	We have two children,
B:	they're both grown and married
B:	and with, we have, uh,
B:	our daughter has three sons,
B:	so we see them at least once a week,
B:	and we see our son and his wife uh, about every other week
B:	and, uh we baby-sit quite frequently.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we're a fairly close-knit family.
B:	We're together a lot on special days
B:	and, uh, and of course, with the holidays and everything.
A:	Well, you're very fortunate.
A:	Uh, my my, uh,
A:	I have two girls and a son,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.
B:	Oh.
A:	She  Her husband builds pianos,
A:	so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to.  Because we've, we, one thing we do have together is we're both musicians.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	I play in several symphony orchestras
A:	and,  she is a, a, a concert, uh, harpsichordist. And travels around a good bit in Europe.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, her husband builds forte pianos,
A:	which are harpsichord size pianos.
B:	Pianos, uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that's why they're over there.
A:	And then I have a, a son who lives in, uh, Warrington, Pennsylvania.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I get to see him maybe once every three months.
A:	So I really, we've lost, you know,
A:	I'd like to have an everyday contact with children, uh, as well as you do, for that matter,
A:	and my young , my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey,
A:	and so they,   I don't hardly get to see any of them.
B:	Oh, you don't get to see any of yours very often.
A:	She works in these, um, Trump type casinos,
A:	she and her husband both do.
A:	They work,  uh, they're really both, um play, people who play on stage
B:	Yes,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for,  plays and things that go on.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But anyhow uh,
A:	what do you, what activities do you do with your children when you are together?
B:	Oh, most the time,
B:	well, right now it's football season,
B:	and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan,
B:	as is our husband,
B:	so, my husband,
B:	so she watches that
B:	and I play with the grandchildren
B:	I enjoy the grandchildren.
B:	But, now, like last weekend, um, there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas,
B:	and it ends,  uh, in January,
A:	Oh.
B:	so she and, and the three boys and my husband and I went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit
B:	and this Sunday,
A:	The Soviet space exhibit?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My goodness.
B:	Yeah Oh, it's been here for quite, uh, some time.
A:	I am surprised they would bring anything over here.
B:	I think it came here in either September or October
B:	and,  it's very interesting, very interesting,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'll bet.
B:	and it's been very well done
B:	Uh, and this, uh, next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game
B:	and, uh,  uh, we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santa's village.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, then when our son's over, we have a pool,
B:	and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends,
B:	and we have cookouts on Sunday uh,
A:	Well, that sounds like you have really,  wonderful activities that keep you together.
B:	And, uh  we, we do a lot with with our kids,
B:	and we we always have.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. *slash error, should be 'b'
B:	We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger.
B:	Uh, we're very family oriented.
B:	We, um,  we like being with our kids,
B:	and the kids seem to enjoy being with us,
B:	and their friends enjoy being with us.
B:	So which that keeps us very, very young, with all these young people passing in and out and eating,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and seems like I've,
A:	The only problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,
A:	doesn't it?
B:	Well, it does
B:	I'm worried about Christmas.
B:	Christmas Eve they all pass through,
B:	and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night, so that,  we open our presents on Christmas day
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Beautiful.
B:	and they go out to the other, you know, the in-laws in between some of this,
B:	but they're all,  with us,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things,
B:	so we see a lot of them.
B:	But we enjoy Christmas Eve night, because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock,
B:	and we open presents about five o'clock Christmas,  morning,
B:	and, you know, and, uh, then,  I go to the kitchen and cook,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and my sister and, and her husband are coming down,
B:	so there's going to be eleven of us for Christmas.
A:	That's great.
A:	There's a,
A:	the question now to ask, is it difficult to find time,
A:	and you seem to be making out all right.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Sometimes I'm a little exhausted
A:	Well, tell me,
A:	what do you think of, uh, of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth?
B:	Oh, I, I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.
B:	I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.
B:	I think, I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there  for about, uh, I don't know, eight or nine years.
A:	Yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.
B:	Parents kind of went and did their thing,
B:	kids did their thing. Yes,
A:	Well, that's
A:	no,
A:	that's exactly what I was going to say.
A:	Of, of course, I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in detail.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	I know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and, and learn much more so than my own kids.
A:	When, when your own children are growing up, you just take them for granted
A:	and you go ahead and do your thing
A:	and,
A:	Okay.
A:	Do you have any children?
B:	Uh, yes,
B:	I have a daughter.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't any children
A:	so I'm going to have difficulty with this topic.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	But, uh, what kinds of things do you and your family do?
B:	Um, well, we go out and fly kites
B:	and we go fishing.
B:	And we go to movies
B:	and we go out to the farm.
B:	And, and, uh, she likes to pick flowers and look at birds.
A:	Um. Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.
A:	I don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that.
A:	That's great.
B:	Well, I'm divorced,
B:	but that's what, when she's with me that's what we do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we color a lot
B:	and I read her stories.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together
A:	and, and I think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed.
A:	Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing
A:	and, uh, because that I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot.
A:	And the communication helps you build on your, uh, helps just, just build your family.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	And even, even when I was, when I was, uh, living with her with did stuff then too, Yeah,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's pretty, to me that's pretty rare.
B:	I know.
A:	I like that.
A:	Whenever I do have children I, I'm going to try as hard as I can to see that we spend a lot of time together, you know,
A:	maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, that's good sometimes because you need to, you know, get away.
A:	But, um, I don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your the family unit.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
B:	Because then you never get to know them either.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They're all grown up
B:	and their,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And as I understand it,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I haven't experienced it,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them
B:	Yeah,
B:	they're out doing stuff by that time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So, um, do you think that you, do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter?
B:	Yeah,
B:	I really do because, because I don't see many others
B:	and when, whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays, we'll see other families.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, not usually on the weekends we don't see very many in comparison.
A:	What do you think is the key to, to just bringing the American family back together?
A:	What kinds of things do you think can?
B:	Well, I think they can turn off the T V for one thing. And, and go out and do stuff, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true. Huh. I think that's the first thing a lot of people do
B:	Because she always likes to do things whenever the T V off.
B:	You know, she'll forget about the T V completely.
A:	and I know I'm guilty of it.
A:	Like I came in from work today
A:	first thing I did was turn the TV on. Because I taped the stories from earlier today.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And I like to watch 'em
A:	but, I think that's that is a big problem. The television
A:	and it's, it's too static, you know,
A:	it's something that you can do
A:	but there's no thinking involved, no motion, you know,
A:	and I think, think that's another reason why people are, uh, so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, people aren't doing anything just sitting around, you know, no thinking involved
A:	and now, I think I think people are trying to get out of that.
A:	At least
A:	and that, um, there's a lot of um,
A:	it's becoming really health conscious
A:	and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that.
A:	And that's probably good, you know,
A:	if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps.
A:	That's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But when was, uh, when she was here last summer we played tennis
B:	but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	When,
A:	How, how old is she?
B:	she's five.
A:	Um. Well, she has,
B:	We, we just been hitting the ball on the ground.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	She can't hit it in the air yet,
B:	and then we kick the ball.
B:	We play like soccer.
A:	You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's good.
A:	That's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um. Okay.
A:	Well it was very nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	So you like to fish, huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	I like to,
A:	I don't have a boat,
A:	but I like to fish
A:	and there's a lot of lakes around here.
A:	Uh, are there many lakes up there?
B:	Yeah,
B:	actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.
B:	We uh, we have the, those little, the, the, the Great Lakes, you know,
B:	uh, Lake Ontario is right near here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Plus, we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York
B:	where there're lots of small lakes everywhere
B:	and these are, uh, real good, uh, for, like, you know, bass fishing and so forth.
A:	They have mostly small mouth in them
A:	or,
B:	No,
B:	we have a, actually quite a lot of variety.
B:	There's, uh, there's,
B:	we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.
B:	Uh, we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	that's right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	So it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about you?
B:	Do you like, what do you like to go for?
A:	Oh, it's, it's, uh,
A:	I fish for bass,
A:	but I hardly ever catch one,
A:	but, uh, uh, they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish
A:	and, uh, you catch that white bass and crappie out of there.
B:	Um.
A:	Every once in a while there'll be striped bass.
B:	We have, uh, some friends who live on the lake
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you go, go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. *listen
B:	But in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once
B:	and we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass
B:	and usually you pull up, you know, thirteen to fourteen inch bass.
A:	Wow.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	probably during, during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,
B:	so what they'll do is
B:	you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,
B:	these people own a little row boat,
B:	and they'll be boating around
B:	and they'll hit a, they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at,
B:	they, they just drop it in.
B:	They can't pull it in fast enough.
A:	What do you, what do you catch perch on?
B:	Uh, I, they actually, they,
B:	according to them, you can catch, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.
A:	Huh.
B:	They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,
B:	but, you know, I've,
B:	she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They'll,
B:	corn or salami or bread or anything,
B:	they'll, they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's,
A:	sometimes I use corn,
A:	but, uh, uh, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's a big problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, the other day I was fishing with bread, uh,
A:	there's a college across the street
B:	Yeah.
A:	and they,
A:	it's, it's full of carp and, uh, I caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, uh, I think it was a number two treble hook,
B:	Um.
A:	and it's huge,
A:	its, its mouth was full of hooks.
B:	Wow.
A:	So he was in a bad way.
A:	But, uh, it's,
A:	he was fast.
A:	He,
B:	A big one?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's, uh, it was sixteen inches long.
B:	Wow, that's, that's, that's a nice size carp.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think it was about a pound and a half, you know,
A:	but all they're good for is the fight.
A:	Boy they they really don't want to come out of the water
A:	they, they zip through the water, you know,
A:	you're, how your line goes, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I thought, you know, that, uh, I wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, uh, the one I hooked just about ten minutes before, when I tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,
A:	so it wasn't hooked very well.
A:	But, you know, I got it that far,
A:	I figured that, uh,
B:	That, that, that counts.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's what I said.
A:	That's what I told the guy.
A:	The guy was standing there
A:	and he laughed when it fell off
A:	and I said, that's a quick release, right there.
B:	Do you, do you, do you actually like the taste of
B:	do you, like, eat the fish that you catch
B:	or are you more of a sport fisherman?
A:	Uh, catfish, yeah.
A:	But, uh, I haven't eaten anything else, you know.
A:	Uh, there's some, uh,
A:	my dad has a farm
A:	and there's,
A:	he has two ponds up there
A:	and my uncle has a, a pond upstream
A:	and there's a lot of crappie in there now.
A:	But, uh, I think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a big enough crappie to eat.
A:	But the catfish, there's, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, that,
A:	yeah.
B:	Right,
B:	so you can just, oh,
B:	because I don't actually like fish.
B:	It's sort of,
B:	so when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and if, you know,
A:	when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.
B:	Right.
B:	And, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know it.
B:	Have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?
A:	Uh, not yet.
A:	My brother went off the coast of Maine, uh,
A:	when the,
A:	I don't know,
A:	what they,
A:	mackerel
B:	Yeah.
A:	that school up there? *listen--is there overlap?
A:	It's
A:	he, he said that it was just like that.
A:	They were throwing like, uh, uh, hell benders or, uh, uh, some other kind of treble hook lure
A:	and, and, uh, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,
A:	sometimes they've had two on, you know, one on every hook.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we, I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago
B:	and we would go and just, uh, drop two, you know, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat.
B:	We just dropped it down there
B:	and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
B:	and you just drop it in and and it just,
B:	you, you get one or two at a shot, you know
B:	and, It's a good deal, too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat.
A:	Wow.
B:	You know, and, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.
A:	Yeah,
A:	down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.
B:	Well, this is,
B:	yeah,
B:	this, this, this was for a, you know, large,
B:	there were maybe thirty of us on the boat.
A:	A group party.
B:	We, we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But this is great, because it was, I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You know,
B:	so you'd get to go out there for, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, and fish all day.
B:	It's really nice
B:	It's real enjoyable.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not.
B:	I think we're probably close, though.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you, too.
B:	Good luck with fishing this season.
A:	Good luck.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
A:	like in a room filled with What do you think about the benefits in jobs?
B:	Um, I'm, I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.
B:	I think that, um, our health insurance is terribly expensive.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.
B:	But, um, you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess.
B:	What about you?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and a lot of times they turn down your claims
A:	so that leaves you paying for all of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or, or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right
A:	the  health insurance I have is Met Life,
B:	Yeah,
A:	and, if,
A:	it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars
A:	and then, uh, the insurance pays the rest of the bill.
A:	Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy thirty.
B:	Now we,
B:	I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered
B:	but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area,
B:	and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower
B:	and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.
B:	And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate. *listen
A:	Right.
A:	And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.
A:	So,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I would assume that you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it's, it's difficult.
B:	What about other, other benefits?
B:	Are there others that you're dissatisfied with?
A:	Well, I work for Sears,
A:	and, and, um, that's about the, the only real benefit you have, is health insurance.
B:	Well, you have vacation, I
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	but everybody gets vacation.
A:	I mean, like, uh, T I and some other places, you know, they have recreational facilities,
A:	and they have a driving range and weight room
A:	and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool
B:	Huh.
A:	and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,
B:	but you know, to me vacation is, is an issue,
B:	and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.
A:	Right.
B:	And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.
B:	Some places count the number of hours
B:	and some places just sort of believe you.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, ours is based on number of days,
B:	and, you know, people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill.
A:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
B:	So maybe that covers the topic then.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I don't know, the the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.
A:	Some places aren't very safe to work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or maybe a uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.
A:	Right,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so.
B:	And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,
B:	how, how they enforce the rules.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	But other than that I don't have much feeling for, for the benefits,
B:	since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them.
A:	Um, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um, how much it costs the employers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.
A:	And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides that.
A:	But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.
B:	Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.
A:	Well, well, they still have to pay it
A:	but they buy their own instead of going through the state.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So apparently it costs less that way.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and at least, you know, financially in the short run,
B:	but I would think they would get a much greater turnover
B:	and that people would be dissatisfied
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's what I, what I think
A:	they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
A:	and how much profit they're making
A:	instead of trying to cut everything down *listen
A:	and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.
B:	I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way,
B:	but I would assume that the productivity is way down, also.
A:	Yeah,
A:	the productivity and the training costs,
A:	if they have to train the same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang onto them.
B:	That's right.
B:	No,
B:	I agree.
A:	Okay,
A:	it was nice talking to you.
B:	Well thank you for calling.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Bye-bye
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	All right.
B:	Well, she lives in Utah,
B:	so.
A:	Oh, uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	That's the way we always were.
A:	We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.
B:	Okay,
B:	let's do
A:	So, you ready?
A:	My children are all gone already.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're, they're all out on their own.
A:	So, uh, do you want to start first do you work?
B:	Okay.
B:	No,
B:	I don't,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I stay home most of the time
B:	but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, you know, there's a,
B:	my neighbor she tends children though
B:	and, and, um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, um, have a, a a law to have them certified or, or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that
A:	Right.
B:	because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to be on , get an okay seal.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but yet most of the problems we hear,
A:	of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, the individual incidence or something.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, now, usually when I have someone tend, um,
B:	my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere
B:	but,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	how old, is your oldest?
B:	before,
B:	He's almost a teenager
A:	Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then
B:	Yeah,
B:	he's, he's very good.
B:	Um, but, um, before that I would, I would use, uh, kids from our church,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they did a good job, for me.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	Um, but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center, or anything,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home.
A:	That's the way with me.
A:	I, I worked four years one time,
A:	but my last two children were, uh, both entering high school age.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they were, of course, gone while I was working
A:	so it wasn't a problem I saw,
A:	and I stayed home the rest of the time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, so I didn't have that problem either.
A:	Now I have, I,
A:	my oldest daughter she has two children
A:	and they've been in day care, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she works full time.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's hard.
A:	It, it's difficult
A:	but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.
B:	Well, some people aren't.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	She, she surprised me though.
A:	She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with, with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.
B:	Oh, is that, is that right?
A:	So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with, with the children.
B:	I think that's really important.
A:	And, uh, they've used the day care most of the time.
A:	They tried one once.
A:	They had a lady come in.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.
A:	And it did not work out. Uh, at all
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It, she thought it was going to.
A:	She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out, in the morning,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, the lady called
A:	and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble.
A:	And this baby is the, is the most pleasant, uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually.
A:	And, and she was having problems with her,
A:	and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Well, my daughter decided to call them and check
A:	and things weren't okay
B:	Oh.
A:	Her, her one son was watching the soapies
A:	which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,
B:	Oh, dear.
A:	and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.
B:	Oh.
A:	And so that ended that, episode,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and she was most upset, uh, over finding this.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I bet.
A:	So, uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better.
A:	There's, uh, more people involved,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	more than one adult they,
A:	and the age groups are separated Uh-huh.
B:	Well, nannies have been an option, uh,
B:	but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like maybe in, uh, preschool would have where they have lessons and, so forth, and so on.
A:	Yes,
A:	story time, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the, this one has been particularly nice.
A:	It, uh, it kept track of what they did,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they would tell the parents what they did that day.
A:	You know, if they said anything or did anything.
A:	So it kind of kept them,
B:	Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,  uh, on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,
A:	if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.
B:	Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,
A:	They may not say anything.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.
B:	You can't really.
B:	You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and usually they aren't at that age. Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and decide.
B:	Well, I know I, uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children. And, uh, you know, I, I wondered if I would have to be certified
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	or whether they'd just bring them
B:	and and we got to where, well, we were just friends
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	And then if there was a problem
B:	and then we'd sit down, and talk about it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it never happened, to be a problem,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and so things worked out okay,
B:	and their kids played with my kids
B:	and it worked out well.
A:	it worked out good.
A:	I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters.
B:	Oh.
A:	Since they'll be going back at the end of the month.
A:	And so, I'm going to give it a try.
B:	That's great.
A:	I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and I've got that worked out.
A:	My husband, he's retired
A:	so he's going to deliver my products
A:	so I'll do my orders and that by phone.
B:	Well, that will be great.
A:	So, um, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I I think I'll enjoy doing ,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I think I'll enjoy.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something
B:	Sure,
B:	why not. That's right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	That's right
A:	Well, they do say you enjoy them more,
A:	a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first
B:	Well, uh, my husband's mother lives right over here,
B:	and she takes care of them sometimes, for me,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and just is a lovely lady,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.
A:	Yeah.
A:	My daughter, always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.
B:	And,
B:	Oh
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first
A:	I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now.
B:	I've lost track.
B:	I don't really know.
B:	I, I do have some opinions,
B:	but go ahead.
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, well I know that they're, they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism.
A:	What,   What?  What all do you know about it?
B:	Uh,   okay ,
B:	I hadn't thought about that, uh.
B:	Uh, well I just have an opinion,
B:	now I didn't think, I thought the terrorism thing was overstated, I mean,
B:	there was nothing over here.
B:	In fact even,
B:	this is not our subject, I guess,
B:	but, uh, maybe it is or isn't, I suppose.
A:	Yeah.
B:	My wife when she talked about the Middle East
B:	and everyone's afraid, you know, of how the war was going to go and everything,
B:	I said, I told her, no,
B:	it's just not going to happen.
B:	There's not going to be any terrorism over him,
B:	and there wasn't, you know.
B:	They just didn't have an organization,
B:	but, uh, I, I, I'm concerned that we're letting too many, that we don't have enough controls.
B:	I think that, uh, the Asian gangsters that we've let in here
B:	and if and the guys from, uh, Cuba, you know, there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, and the last, you know,
B:	out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from, from Asia
B:	and I think that  there's got to be some sort of controls over that.
A:	That's right.
B:	I mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't, I didn't know what, I don't even know what our controls are.
B:	I don't even know what, uh, if we have any guidelines at all, uh, on immigration.
B:	Um, I always thought that we did,
B:	but I don't, I don't, I don't know what they are right now.
A:	There, I don't think there's much of, much of one, because I'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, most of them, it's just like Australia, most of them were criminals from Cuba
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I think that was just an attempt that, that Fidel Castro to undermine, you know the United States to some extent.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us.
A:	And it's almost the same thing in, in, uh, from Asia, because  a lot, a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war,
B:	Because we,
A:	and,
B:	I, I do have some sympathy with, uh, you know,
B:	of course we have this big Mexican problem,
B:	not a problem,
B:	but I think that we need to do something with, uh, the immigration of back and forth across Mexico, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I'm sympathetic,
B:	I don't know what the answer is, I guess.
B:	I'm sympathetic certainly with that, that, that they want to come over here
B:	and they, I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work.
B:	And if, if they have jobs, you know, I hear the story that they're taking away American jobs.
B:	But I don't know, uh,
B:	I don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away.
A:	Right.
B:	So I, I'm sympathetic,
B:	but I don't have an answer.
B:	I don't uh, I think that we should have good relations with, with Mexico,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but that's not really exactly immigration.
B:	It is
B:	and it isn't.
B:	I don't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens,
B:	owe the children education and all that, uh,
B:	although, the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world.
B:	So I guess it's what they,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	their, the Mexican kids get a good education along the way,
B:	and maybe that's a benefit to everybody, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they have green cards.
A:	And, uh, then, like you said, a lot of,
A:	I run into people every day that can't speak English.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh, and, and most of them, you know, are working in janitorial positions
A:	so,  So, I, I don't know,
B:	Yeah.
B:	And that,
A:	like you said, I don't know how much, how much they're taking from the work force, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I never thought that they were much.
B:	I do cringe when I hear some of the problems we've had.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, uh, of course you mentioned the language.
B:	I feel so bad that we, here in Texas, or certainly the southern part of the United States, uh, California, Texas, and all that, why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish, uh, by junior high, you know as well as us, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so that we could, wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.
B:	That, that, that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico,
B:	and then, in Europe, you know, they speak their French and all
B:	and they try, they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand.
B:	We, we we don't really even make an effort to speak Spanish,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I feel bad about that
B:	Go ahead.
A:	Well, that's,
A:	I
A:	yeah
A:	I took Spanish in school,
A:	and that's, you know, one reason that I did it  is because, because whenever you travel anywhere near the border, you know, there more and more people speak Spanish.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess it's never too late.
B:	I, I do have some Spanish books,
B:	and I've always, uh,
B:	every year I say I'm going to try to speak some newcomers language, you know.
B:	I don't know if it's costing us any money
B:	or how much money they're putting into it, uh,
B:	that's always a factor,
B:	I mean how much, my wife says, How much the federal government is putting into it immigration.
A:	Well yeah,
A:	well, it's basically on the, well,
A:	I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders,
A:	and, uh, it's more, um,
A:	the immigration is tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.
A:	So they have to watch out who comes in,
A:	and, and they're always finding drugs on, you know, on the most, um, calls out in innocent looking kind of
B:	Yeah.
A:	I forgot what they found,
A:	but a dog found it the other day, you know on the border.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Oh yeah,
B:	I, I, I think that certainly is a problem.
B:	I guess our immigration history, that's a great subject.
B:	They, uh, didn't say to talk about that,
B:	but that is, I mean,
B:	on Ellis Island, they,
B:	you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum, a national museum.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That certainly was interesting,
B:	since all of us had, uh, ancestors that came over that way.
B:	Or not all,
B:	but I guess, I guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally, you know.
B:	But, uh, a lot of us have parents, grandparents,
B:	my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that.
B:	And I'm sure they came over, you know, through Ellis Island, you know.
A:	That's right.
A:	Well. *slash error Yeah,
B:	So we all immigrants, one way or another, well
B:	we certainly are, coming from Europe.
A:	and one of the, one of the things that really gets to me, uh, about the Mexicans is that, um, once they have children over here, their children are American citizens then.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	those were laws are unusual.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then they'll ship the parents back
A:	and that leaves the children without any parents.
A:	So, And they, you know, and, and they just follow the rule no matter, you know.
B:	Yeah,
A:	So that doesn't seem fair to the children.
B:	sometimes common sense should take over rather than,
B:	yeah,
B:	that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way.
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until they, uh, get citizenship.
B:	I'm sure they want to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I heard something about that, yeah.
A:	And, uh, a lot of them had been, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Some of them, some of them moved back and forth,
A:	but  uh, most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico,
B:	Yeah.
A:	especially  the way it was then.
B:	Oh no.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	I, I could see, you could see why.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything.
B:	What the controls are.
A:	I think most, you know, like especially the celebrities and everything, they just have a, uh, well, they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work, you know, in movies and, and such.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But most of them have temporary visas.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, uh.
A:	As long, it's like well,
A:	it's a kind of a bad, a bad, bad example,
A:	but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
A:	So that, you know,
A:	and that's the thing with the jobs.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And of course no one beat him out.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, you know. He just ruined his own career,
A:	so.
B:	Oh, well yeah.
A:	Yeah
B:	Yeah,
B:	well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the, one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to.
B:	Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist countries, uh,
B:	I guess Poland now, now is noncommunist
B:	so maybe not,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly, uh, change,
B:	maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.
B:	So many people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand,
B:	so many of the people will go back overseas.
B:	You know, maybe it will average out,
B:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think so.
B:	It doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.
A:	Because there are other I, uh, job opportunities, in Europe that there aren't here you know, even, um,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	like orchestra players can find a job sometimes line in Europe when they can't find one here.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I'm a trumpet player.
B:	Are you a teacher?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	I, uh, I don't any more.
A:	I just went to school
A:	and I was a music major for a while.
B:	Oh, really,
B:	yeah.
A:	But I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony.
A:	So,  so he had to have a work visa there.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	And of course they had a lot of musicians from, from other countries  and, uh, in the Mexico City Symphony.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I think, um, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now.
B:	Oh, really.
A:	But I think the conductor, I don't know, or one of the conductors is, is from another country.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's like any other symphony.
B:	Yeah
A:	You know, and then, and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico
A:	so he had to,
A:	Well, I, um, I haven't really lived in a lot of big cities.
A:	I mean, I'm living in Dallas now.
A:	Plano is outside of Dallas,
A:	but, um, so I don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	But, I know when I lived down in Houston, on the outskirts of Houston, there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And, um, if you would drive by there, like on your way to the beach or something, there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke, into the air
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and it always smelled really bad.
A:	We know that, that was really, really, really bad for the atmosphere.
A:	What have you got up there?
B:	Well, I, I live out in the country,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	so that part is good.
B:	Uh, we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh,
B:	which has a lot of pollution from their plants,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator. *sp: we're
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, uh, it won't be too for from where we live. *sp: far
B:	And everybody really has been, you know, fighting against it, because we, we do not want it.
B:	Well, we don't want one any place
A:	Sure.
B:	we would like the, uh, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, uh, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much. Huh-uh.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It's just, I mean, it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air
A:	and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. *there they're
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Plus all the problems in the Middle East.
A:	With all that smoke and,
B:	Oh, that has to be terrible over there.
A:	Yeah.
A:	So it's just, um, why are we doing this to ourselves
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	I just don't know,
A:	but, um, I, you know, what really amazes me about, like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries, is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a neighborhood.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and you just thought, well, it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there,
A:	and what comes up, must come down
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Breathing it, we're breathing it all the time.
A:	Yes.
A:	And, and how, if they have all of those, um,
A:	toxicity, I mean, it, there's signs around saying how dangerous it is
A:	and here you are living ...
B:	Huh-uh
A:	That just doesn't make too much sense.
B:	No.
B:	And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste, no matter who does it. and they have shown, some of the industries have been real good at, uh, uh, doing their part in, uh, reducing the amount that they have, *sd
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Uh, they've reused some of it, uh,
B:	it can be recycled, a lot of their things,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and that they've shown, that it, uh, to begin with, apparently it does cost more,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	but, once they get started, it's really, it saves them money in the end,
B:	and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And if they would all,
B:	that's what, that's what we want done.
B:	Is, we want industry to take, you know, more responsibility in taking care of it.
A:	Well, um, individual companies and things are so selfish,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And their desires to save a few dollars and, and that
A:	they don't care about the environmental impact, that they make.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	they're greedy.
B:	It's money, is what is.
B:	It's, it's the money
A:	Yes.
B:	They're making fantastic amounts on these things
B:	and, uh, even the incinerator, the money and the income that they're going to make off this, is, you know, just astronomical.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, have you ever visited, um, like Los Angeles or any place that's ever, it's kind of known, that it has, uh, pollution in it's air?
B:	We've never been,
B:	we went as far as, as, uh, like Las Vegas, and Yellow Stone Park,
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	We did go, we should have gone the whole way over,
B:	but we didn't.
B:	But, I understand that,
B:	we have an aunt that lives out there
B:	and, When she was visiting here, she would look up at the stars
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	She said they couldn't see those things out there, because of the smog and everything.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	That's so awful.
A:	Well, what about in New York.
A:	I guess you've gone that way, maybe.
B:	No.
B:	Never been in New York
B:	I don't want to go there
A:	Pretty funny.
B:	Have you been there?
A:	Well, I've been to New York.
A:	I have relatives that direction.
B:	Oh.
A:	We have,
A:	it's, um,
A:	is it close to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania?
B:	Um, no,
B:	I never heard of that one.
A:	Because I have family there
A:	and,
B:	We're near Pittsburgh, Clarion University.
A:	Oh, huh-uh.
A:	It's pretty neat.
B:	It's, it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania.
A:	That's beautiful country up that way.
A:	I know,
A:	it's, um, very lush and pretty, Up in the, back in the east.
A:	It's really,
B:	Are you a young person?
A:	Well, I'm thirty-one.
B:	Thirty-one.
B:	You're, you're young
A:	Seems kind of old to me.
B:	No,
B:	you're young.
B:	You have a lot of life yet,
B:	and, and these,
B:	we have some people who say, well, this isn't going to affect me, this air pollution,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	uh, older people,
B:	or they think they're far enough away from something, that it's,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody.
B:	And if you're older it's not going to affect you that way.
B:	You have grandchildren,
B:	you have children, uh,
A:	Yes.
B:	Nieces, nephews, whatever, friends.
B:	Uh, everybody is going to be affected by it.
A:	That's really true.
A:	And we all, you know, need to be willing to help pay a little bit. Like,
A:	I've heard some people, uh, grumble about their, uh, cars passing their emission tests, and things,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and how they've had to, how it's more expensive and things.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And I thought, well, it's so much better.
B:	They say it has really made a difference, though.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Now, see, we don't have that here, yet.
A:	Oh, you don't.
B:	No,
B:	we don't have that testing in that down here, yet.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	But they,
B:	I have read that, that, that it has really helped where the problem is greater, where the population is greater,
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	and that it has made a difference.
A:	Well, I really think it must.
A:	I think every,
A:	I mean, well, think about how many automobiles there are.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And each is putting out,
A:	like we have a car,
A:	an older, one of our cars is an older car,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	and every time you start it, from the tail pipe, it makes a black spot, on the cement,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	And you know that, that is a sign.
B:	Something is coming out,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that's, all cars are doing that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it's really polluting the air.
B:	Yeah.
B:	If you have to put a price on it. Which is more valuable, life or paying a little more.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	And it's also, it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer,  and things,
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	We sure wouldn't want, so much more people suffering from that.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And like I said, I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it, because it's industry.
B:	We're paying industry to make the products
B:	and, we're helping pay for there making these end products that are, toxic waste.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Then, we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace,
B:	then they put it in the dump some place
B:	and they find out, well, this dump doesn't work
B:	so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else.
B:	We end up paying for it again.
B:	Now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted.
A:	Pretty sad.
B:	Or the,
B:	where they want to put, the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion, the two water sheds that feed Clarion river.
A:	Oh, no.
B:	And, you know, it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there, because, if that water gets contaminated, it will go on down to Pittsburgh.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	It will, you know,
B:	it affects so many people.
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this.
A:	No.
A:	No.
A:	It's scary
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	It's scary.
B:	It really is.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	It's really awful.
A:	Well, I've really enjoyed the conversation.
A:	It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about
B:	It is really a concern. Huh-uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
A:	And it's, instead of waiting until it directly affects me, like you say, it's important to be involved ahead of time.
A:	Well, you have a good day.
B:	Well, you, too.
A:	Thank you.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	I have got two.
B:	One is, uh, two
B:	and the other one's four
B:	and, uh, this is my first year of staying home.
B:	I've always had them in child care.
A:	Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
A:	I, uh, I have grandchildren
A:	and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well, two of them have gone to preschool.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.
A:	Why don't you tell me what you have found.
B:	Well, uh, the,
B:	with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with
B:	and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them
B:	and so I found another baby-sitter
B:	and she was wonderful
B:	except I thought that there were too many in the home
B:	and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.
B:	She was wonderful,
B:	it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.
B:	It was in home child care.
A:	Okay, Okay,
A:	so it was in home child care.
A:	You took them to someone's home?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, both times?
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers
B:	and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in
B:	so I just always had a fear about, you know, child care centers.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
B:	and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill
B:	so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent
B:	and, uh, I could go back to work.
A:	I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate,
A:	I didn't have to work,
A:	we didn't necessarily have a lot of things
B:	Yeah
B:	That's how it's going now.
A:	But, uh, and, I know my daughter,
A:	because she has three
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean it's so expensive.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You have to really make a lot of money.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.
B:	Oh, no,
B:	yeah.
A:	You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.
A:	It was, there was too many children per person.
A:	They were just kind of left to play,
A:	there was no structure to,
A:	and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff.
A:	Not just there, you know,
A:	so he went like, uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base,
A:	you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.
B:	Huh.
A:	There was no structure,
A:	there was nothing to it.
A:	You know, and, uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.
A:	It was, it was like a little kindergarten.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they had hot lunches
A:	and, and they had classes that, you know, one class they'd do art.
A:	They even familiarized the children with computers.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	And how old was he?
A:	He's now five and a half.
A:	He's in kindergarten.
B:	Oh.
A:	This was last year.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so, you know, it helped him and, and the first one, uh, he went to a, uh, church preschool that was very good.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The Methodist Church in Richardson.
B:	Oh.
A:	The big one
A:	and it was a excellent,
A:	they,
A:	very good.
B:	My little boy goes to the Methodist, uh, in Garland.
A:	Oh, does he?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm real happy with that one.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.
B:	Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Even the even the Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good.
A:	Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, that, you know, that they were good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I I didn't know that, uh, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not that familiar.
A:	I just know that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I'm real happy with that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, Well, are you enjoying staying home?
B:	Well, that's a,
B:	Yes,
B:	I am
B:	Uh, I taught for Richardson School District
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I taught early childhood
B:	and I really enjoyed it,
B:	but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time
B:	and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them
B:	and it just seemed like they were sick more often
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just couldn't get the time off to,
B:	so,
A:	Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is.
B:	It really is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it really is.
B:	And I felt,
A:	Okay, uh,
A:	could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air pollution?
B:	Well, it's hard to say.
B:	I mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.
B:	What do you think?
A:	Um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.
A:	I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put into the atmosphere.
A:	I think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?
B:	No,
B:	I'm more out in the suburbs,
B:	but I certainly work near a city.
A:	Okay,
A:	so Can you notice,
B:	How about you?
A:	well it's, it's,
A:	I live in a rural area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's mainly farms and, uh, no heavy industry.
A:	Attleboro, itself,
A:	I live in Rhode Island.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	And, it's in the north,
A:	I live up in the, uh, northeast corner
A:	and Attleboro sits in just over the line, where T I's plant is,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but there isn't a lot of heavy industry.
A:	There's the freeways
A:	and we get an occasional,
A:	it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston, cause we're like forty miles south of Boston,
A:	so we'll pick up that.
A:	And, uh, I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,
A:	we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
A:	and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,
A:	they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue.
A:	I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping.
A:	But, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. You know from the power plants. Um.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You mean like from the coal.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	we generate,
A:	one of our, our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to, uh, generate electricity.
B:	Um,
A:	Um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from them,
A:	but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.
B:	Um, it's interesting
B:	because in order to, uh, keep with the E P A standards which, which tend to be visible, uh, what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night.
B:	Uh, so people get up,
A:	Okay,
A:	well, is that right?
B:	Yeah,
B:	people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
B:	and they've got this black ash on their cars, which, you know, seems to be,
A:	Yeah,
A:	surprise, surprise.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know,
A:	Yeah.
A:	There, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, we've got reports that, uh,
A:	during the night seems like they'd blow off their, their stacks from, uh, the warehouses, for powerhouses,
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, you know, spots all over them.
B:	Right.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So, you're right,
A:	they could do something about, about that, I guess.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That seems a little ridiculous.
A:	How are your, uh, your lakes,
A:	and, uh,
B:	Oh they've been getting cleaner.
A:	They have?
B:	Sure.
B:	But, um, yeah,
B:	I'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain,
B:	yeah,
A:	Acid rain,
A:	yeah,
A:	that's, that's what I was, uh,
B:	I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, uh, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.
B:	Um,
B:	I'm not an expert.
A:	Yeah,
A:	no.
A:	Didn't they just have an article, oh, on, uh,
A:	they were dumping lime.
B:	Up here?
A:	Up, upstate New York somewhere, over huge areas,
B:	I haven't read that.
B:	Oh yeah.
A:	and they thought that was more beneficial because, you know it, it, some of it does soak in
A:	and some of it runs off right away into the, in to the streams and rivers
A:	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can't remember where
A:	I, I read that recently somewhere,
A:	and I can't remember where.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's
A:	But I, I thought it was up there.
A:	So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, um, they showed pictures of, of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
A:	Um, you kind of think it's something else then?
B:	Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.
B:	So that,
A:	Oh, they didn't say, they didn't say what though,
A:	they just said they thought it was,
B:	They didn't say what,
B:	they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected. Um, that it may be other natural things at work. Um,
A:	Uh, natural disease,
B:	Yeah,
B:	so it's, it's less than clear.
B:	Like I said, I don't remember the article that well.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But, um, I don't know,
B:	I mean, what do you think we can, uh, I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, uh, air pollution?
A:	Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.
A:	I still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult.
B:	I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.
A:	Yeah,
A:	Yeah,
A:	you I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.
B:	I mean, I remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,
B:	the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent, of the automobile pollution
A:	Yeah,
B:	and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're better,
A:	but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there.
A:	Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh,
B:	Yeah,
B:	but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.
A:	Uh, I'm not really sure.
A:	You think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking industry is that, uh, incompetent, that they wouldn't, you know,
A:	fuel is, is one of their biggest costs.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you would,
B:	But diesel engines.
A:	Yeah,
A:	diesel engines.
B:	It, you know, it's, it,
B:	I mean, they do generate a lot of soot
B:	but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems.
A:	This country seems to be a little behind on that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.
A:	Um, yeah,
A:	but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car, driving.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	A lot of people don't even like to carpool.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we could that.
A:	That'll help, pollution, air pollution,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	The, uh, United States and Canada are I guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,
B:	Yeah,
B:	sure.
A:	So that's helping.
B:	Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe
B:	and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?
A:	Now that's an idea.
A:	don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,
B:	Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax
B:	or you just buy one of these things
B:	and it, it, uh,
B:	maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
B:	and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
B:	and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
B:	and you couldn't start your car anymore.
A:	That's a, that's an interesting concept.
A:	Is that your idea?
B:	Yeah,
B:	but, uh, you know, it's, uh,
B:	I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
B:	so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something.
A:	Well I was going to say,
A:	right.
A:	You could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.
B:	Right.
A:	I mean I guess you could take those off too
A:	but,
B:	You could take
B:	but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.
A:	Yeah,
A:	if you can take a muffler off and only replace,
A:	well not unless it was built into every muffler.
B:	Right.
A:	And that's .
B:	But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,
A:	That's a, that's quite a concept.
A:	You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	patent it,
B:	that's a good idea.
A:	If you could come up with a device that's the thing.
B:	Right.
A:	But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.
A:	But that's a, that's a thought.
A:	No,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you're right
A:	and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.
A:	I don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	well you might, uh, generate some
B:	Yeah,
B:	the automobile regulatory agencies or something.
A:	yeah,
A:	you might generate some interest in it.
A:	But that's, that's a good idea.
A:	Other than that I'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	What are your music interests?
A:	Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock
A:	I, I don't care, for acid rock,
B:	Me, too.
B:	Oh.
A:	but, uh, I grew up with country and western,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I did, too,
A:	but, uh,
B:	and then,
A:	just about any kind of music.
A:	I even like classical music.
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I'm pretty diversified, too.
B:	I, I don't, I don't like acid rock either.
B:	I, I grew up in a small town
B:	so, uh, the only, we only had one radio station
B:	so it was country music,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but then, uh, when I,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
B:	Oh, really.
B:	You're older than I am
A:	But, uh, I,
A:	did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?
B:	We don't get Channel Two.
B:	My, uh, our cable doesn't,
A:	Oh.
B:	I wish we got that what,
B:	but,
A:	That is fabulous.
B:	Was it?
B:	Well, we don't get Channel Two.
A:	We,
A:	Yeah,
A:	when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, it was tremendous.
B:	Now, he, he is a, uh,
B:	actually, I did,
B:	I played flute for, almost ten years
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, so, I, I, I appreciate his too, his, his
A:	Yeah.
B:	he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh-huh,
A:	and it was, uh, mostly all Irish tunes,
B:	Was
B:	yeah.
A:	they had a band with him that, uh, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, uh, drum,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth,
A:	it was just fabulous.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, he, he is really good.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I, I come from a musical background,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so, uh, uh, I've played flute, flute and piano,
B:	so, I, I, I have a big appreciation for music, up to a point.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming and much of the new stuff that's coming out,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	my husband says I'm getting old
A:	Yeah
A:	I love, uh, I, I especially like instrumentals.
B:	Do you?
A:	Yeah.
A:	I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's nice to do, that is.
B:	I've got a, I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting,
B:	I'm getting well versed in, in kiddy music
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life,
A:	I've always wanted too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
B:	Yeah
A:	but, uh,
B:	I was one of the forced ones
A:	but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
B:	Oh, I could never do that
A:	and,
B:	I was never that brave
B:	but, uh, yeah.
A:	I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh, yeah,
B:	I've, I've done, I've done that at church too.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't done that in a long time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, let's see
B:	what .
B:	Well, what kind of music do you not like?
A:	Well, like I say the acid rock,
A:	I just do not
A:	an I don't care for rap music either.
B:	Oh,
B:	that's not music
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	no.
B:	that is not,
B:	I don't know what that is,
B:	but that's not music
A:	If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.
B:	Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,
B:	it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,
B:	it is just, it's not exciting at all
A:	Yeah.
B:	it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you can't dance to it,
B:	you can't do anything to it
A:	Right.
A:	But, I, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Have you?
B:	Is
B:	are, are they good?
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're good.
B:	Are they?
B:	I, I have, I have, never been.
A:	And, uh, we went and saw, uh, LES MISERABLES
B:	Oh, really?
A:	oh, the music in that was fantastic.
B:	I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I heard that was hard to get tickets to.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it, it, uh,
A:	I can't remember how far in advance we reserved, tickets
A:	but it was out, you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall
A:	and, uh it was well worth the price.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that was a real,
B:	Was it?
A:	Yeah,
B:	I, I bet it was,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I really bet it was
B:	Is that the only, uh, musical,
B:	do you go see a lot of musicals?
A:	Just, just ever so often you know, a real, a real good one like that one
B:	Yeah.
A:	and,
B:	That, that would be, that would be nice
A:	I went and saw, uh, I think it was, uh, SUGAR BABIES,
A:	that was good,
A:	that had good music in it.
B:	Was it?
B:	How, how,
B:	I can't, I don't know what that's about.
A:	Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney
A:	and, uh, oh, what's that real, oh, not real old, my wife she is old too, dancer, uh,
A:	I can't think of her name.
A:	I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.
B:	Uh, uh, uh, I think I know who you're oh, I know who you're talking about,
A:	real long legs, and dark hair.
B:	she's got black hair,
B:	Yeah,
B:	okay,
B:	I know who your talking about.
B:	I can't think ever her name either.
A:	I can't think of it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that that was, that was,
B:	I remember that being, uh, here a few years ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but, uh,
B:	Oh, oh, the last country music,
B:	my, my parents still, uh, really like country, music
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they, they like, uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	and, and, uh, well, my, my, my, my parents,
A:	The Blackwoods.
B:	yeah,
B:	my husband likes, uh, country music real well
B:	and he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, yeah,
B:	he really likes Shenandoah.
A:	Alabama.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, yeah,
B:	Alabama,
A:	Uh,
B:	I think, I think they're a bit over exposed
A:	Yeah
B:	I get kind, of get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.
A:	Yeah,
A:	either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.
B:	Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.
A:	I never have either,
A:	and I never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.
B:	Oh
B:	Oh, we, we watch those award shows too,
B:	we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff
B:	but I just, I just don't care for him,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just never have.
B:	I don't,
A:	I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.
B:	Is, is it?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
B:	I, I think, I, I know who that is,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	I think my parents have have, uh, some of his records.
A:	But, uh, I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western, songs,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him him.
B:	I've heard the name.
A:	He was, uh, played in the old western movies.
A:	He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe
B:	Huh.
A:	or they,
A:	I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy
A:	and,
B:	I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,
A:	had a real raspy voice,
B:	Huh.
A:	and, uh,
B:	No,
B:	I never have
A:	some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	those go back quite a way
A:	Yeah.
A:	I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, my mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant,
B:	It's hard to,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records
B:	Well, that
B:	that's neat.
A:	so, that's where I got my,
B:	that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.
B:	Is there not?
B:	You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.
A:	Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, uh phonograph.
B:	Well, that's a shame
B:	because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot
B:	and you see seventy-eights, a, a lot at, at the stores, at record stores,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you'd, think there'd be a market for,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them
B:	but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.
B:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, those things were big and thick weren't they?
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	You could kill somebody with them
A:	Yeah,
A:	warped real easy.
B:	And the ones you buy,
B:	go out and buy one now
B:	and they're just so thin and, flimsy
A:	Yeah.
B:	and they just, they're not meant to last, at all,
A:	Yeah.
B:	neither are tapes.
B:	I, I we buy cassette tapes,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and machines will eat them,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and so, the best bet, any, these days are compact disk,
B:	those things are practically indestructible
A:	But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you,
A:	back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,
B:	Oh, no.
A:	so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,
B:	Radio.
A:	and, uh,
B:	that's just what, just what you had,
B:	plus,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I think it was better back then to,
B:	there's too much T V now
A:	Yeah.
B:	and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than, than television,
A:	Yeah.
B:	your imagination
A:	Yeah.
B:	kept
B:	and
B:	it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
A:	Yeah,
A:	I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Was it on the radio every week?
A:	Yeah.
B:	what day, what day was that on,
B:	do you, can you recall.
A:	Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday,
B:	Uh.
A:	Friday or,
B:	Okay.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?
B:	Do you think it's a
A:	Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.
A:	I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.
B:	Yes,
B:	yes,
A:	I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
A:	and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
A:	and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
B:	That's true.
A:	and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think it teaches kids how to grow.
A:	How about yourself?
B:	Uh, I agree with you.
B:	Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,
B:	you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts
B:	and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,
B:	but these days they're not, uh,
B:	parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.
B:	Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I've, I've,
A:	that's really great.
A:	I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.
B:	They are
B:	but parents,
A:	You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,
B:	Yeah,
B:	they do.
A:	and they don't follow it at all, you know.
A:	There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals
A:	but,
B:	I, I, uh,
B:	senior.
A:	Oh.
A:	Senior,
A:	okay.
A:	So, there's not, uh,
B:	Oh, they're just not,
B:	once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they lose interest.
A:	and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're more for, I
B:	Me
A:	Not, not,
A:	yeah.
B:	Grab,
B:	grab,
B:	grab,
B:	walk out
A:	Yeah,
A:	you're absolutely right
B:	Yeah
A:	I think it's a really a good thing.
A:	I, I like to see,
A:	of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help
B:	Yeah,
B:	but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.
A:	But I think, we ought to start right here at home.
A:	I'm, you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.
A:	No,
A:	it, it,
B:	But, since there is much that needs to be done here.
A:	I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here
A:	and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's been really good.
A:	We talked about this for a few minutes,
A:	and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,
A:	but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.
B:	No,
B:	I, I agree with you
A:	It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	Well you take care,
A:	and, and, enjoy the day.
B:	You, too.
B:	You, too.
A:	Thank you, ma'am.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Do are you on a regular exercise program right now?
B:	Yes,
B:	and I hate it
B:	How about you?
A:	Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on.
B:	Off and on
B:	well, I guess I've been kind of off and on
B:	I've, uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, uh,
A:	Right now I'm kind of off.
B:	I'd say more on than off
A:	Okay,
A:	what type of exercise do you do?
B:	Uh, I do walking on the treadmill,
B:	and then I do low impact aerobics.
A:	Okay.
A:	I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
B:	Not, not really.
A:	Do you find that, uh, to be boring?
B:	Yeah,
B:	and time consuming,
B:	I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,
B:	it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,
B:	then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But I,
B:	Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
A:	Yeah,
A:	I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not
A:	I just bought myself a solo flex machine,
A:	I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.
A:	But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,
A:	so it's collecting dust right now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	a lot of things do that.
B:	I had an, I had an exercise bike
A:	I used to jog somewhat.
B:	I use to have one,
B:	and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,
B:	but I do use my treadmill
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, that's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	my parents have a treadmill
A:	it's,
A:	when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I just got the bicycle out today,
A:	and it was real nice outside,
A:	had to get out to do something.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can't ride a bike
B:	so.
A:	I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
A:	so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.
B:	Oh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's too nice,
B:	it's been too nice all weekend.
A:	But, uh, yeah,
A:	I need to start jog something again.
A:	I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,
A:	but it's terribly boring,
A:	and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
B:	Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
A:	No,
A:	I never have.
A:	Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries
A:	I usually only go about a mile or two.
B:	I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's not quite so so easy.
A:	You have to have the right, type of shoes too,
A:	that's, very important.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .
A:	But,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
A:	my don't get very much use
B:	Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I usually enjoy the exercise I do
A:	but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.
A:	So I'll, I'll bicycle
A:	I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,
A:	but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.
A:	But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,
A:	I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, don't let it collect dust.
B:	At least exercise while dusting it off
A:	Yeah.
B:	well.
A:	Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that, that'll be good.
A:	I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,
A:	an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.
B:	Oh.
A:	And that was very helpful
A:	we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I found that to be, uh, very helpful.
B:	Are you going to do that?
A:	Uh, I need to,
A:	I haven't started yet
A:	but, uh, it's a thought.
B:	Well, that sounds like something good to do then.
A:	Sounds like something I should do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.
A:	How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?
B:	Well, I do,
B:	I switch every other day
B:	one day I walk
B:	and one day I do the aerobics.
A:	Okay,
A:	how far, about how far do you go walking?
B:	Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now
B:	I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,
B:	and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,
A:	Okay.
B:	but I'm trying to workup to three miles.
A:	Well, that's good.
A:	Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.
B:	Yeah,
A:	It,
B:	it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.
A:	Sure.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but.
A:	Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,
B:	My walkman broke,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I'm upset
B:	and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud
A:	Yeah.
A:	But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it is
B:	and this doesn't, you know,
B:	my treadmill has an incline
B:	and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it.
A:	Um, do you go to an aerobics class
A:	or do you watch, on T V?
B:	No,
B:	I, I just do it on T V,
A:	Okay.
B:	I have a cassette.
A:	Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V?
B:	Um, it's a, it's a
B:	I use tapes.
A:	Oh, okay,
A:	okay,
A:	like a Cathy Smith workout,
B:	Or, or Richard Simmons,
A:	or Jane Fonda.
A:	Okay
B:	Sweating to the oldies
A:	Right.
A:	I, every now and then I'll watch E S P N,
A:	I get cable on T V,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training,
A:	and, uh, what is the other one called.
B:	There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,
B:	I don't know if he's still on any more or not,
B:	I I don't know if I get E S P N or not
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, one, you know,
B:	I use to watch one, watch one on the air,
B:	but that was back,
A:	BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill.
B:	That's was,
B:	yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I watched that cause he was cute
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's not bad
A:	his assistants usually aren't either.
B:	But, uh,
A:	They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, they, they do low I pact stuff now,
B:	Do they.
B:	Are
B:	yeah
B:	they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	every morning.
B:	I'll have to tune in.
A:	It's on E S P N, uh,
A:	at what time,
A:	I can't remember what time.
A:	It's, uh, you know,
A:	I can't remember offhand what time.
B:	I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up,
A:	Yeah
B:	and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on
A:	Yeah,
A:	every now and then.
B:	Not everybody has a picture perfect body.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.
B:	I haven't watch any other ones on T V. watch=watched Just on some of the tapes.
A:	They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.
B:	Okay,
B:	thanks.
A:	but, uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made.
B:	Now, that's a thought.
A:	So I'm kind of bad about that myself.
B:	Well, that's thought,
B:	I haven't thought about that,
B:	well they're going to beep us pretty soon.
A:	Okay,
A:	well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.
B:	Nice talking to you too.
B:	Okay,
B:	thanks.
A:	So, all right.
B:	Talk to you later.
A:	Good night.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
B:	Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?
A:	Well, I don't know.
A:	I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening.
A:	Uh, I'm against it
A:	but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that
A:	So I, I have a rifle in the house.
A:	Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it.
A:	But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon.
A:	Uh, how do you feel about it?
B:	Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, I think they need that.
B:	Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.
B:	It's a little twenty-two
B:	and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, I do like to have my guns.
B:	Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.
B:	And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old
B:	Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, I like to have them where handy.
A:	Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition.
A:	And I thought that was really good.
A:	And I think if they, uh,
A:	takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.
A:	You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.
B:	I've never heard of anything like that.
A:	Yeah. Uh,
B:	That would be nice.
B:	But,  you know,
B:	the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.
A:	I  I, I agree.
A:	I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.
A:	But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.
B:	Yeah
A:	And you can get them really cheap.
B:	I know
B:	I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we bought it there.
B:	And,
A:	How long was the waiting period out there?
B:	About nine days.
A:	Huh.
A:	That wasn't too, too bad.
B:	No.
B:	No
A:	Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.
A:	You're not going to react that quickly.
A:	In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.
B:	somebody wants to do that,
B:	I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.
A:	They both do the same kind of job.
B:	A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.
A:	Uh, yeah.
A:	I suppose.
A:	I never got shot with either one.
A:	But I don't know, uh,
A:	I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
B:	No,
B:	a shotgun's got too much of a spread.
B:	Or at  least ours does.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, it's, you know,
B:	you have a little, uh, thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you, you turn it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.
A:	Oh.
B:	And the spread changes.
A:	Uh, I've got a manual single shot
A:	and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it.
A:	The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets from the target.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets.
A:	It's got a hell of a kick to it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time.
B:	And I shot that thing one time.
B:	Almost knocked me down.
B:	And it just a
B:	I I forget,
B:	I think it was a three fifty-seven.
B:	I'm not sure.
A:	Do you belong to a gun club or you?
B:	He belonged to one awhile back.
B:	Uh, since we moved,
B:	we've only been here in Texas for about a year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for  target practice.
A:	No kidding.
B:	I'd love to get used to that shotgun.
B:	We traded his pistol for that shotgun.
A:	Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive
A:	but, uh, it's well worth it.
A:	You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.
A:	Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire.
A:	Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.
A:	Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member.
A:	So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.
A:	Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, that's what my husband,
B:	when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it's a cough or something was
B:	It, you know,
B:	he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.
A:	I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.
A:	In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.
B:	That's a good,
B:	I've never thought of that.
B:	That's a good point.
A:	And, you know, it, it,
A:	even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive.
A:	And you give him a license because he waited nine days.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's,
B:	and, yeah.
A:	He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.
A:	He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.
B:	It,
B:	well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis
B:	and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.
B:	And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot.
A:	Wow.
A:	He was fortunate.
A:	He could, he could of hit something else
B:	Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off.
B:	He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure, being,  Mister Cowboy.
A:	Wow.
B:	I can't remember what the the term was going around.
B:	It was about four or five years ago.
B:	But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea
A:	About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?
A:	Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me.
A:	How do you feel about that?
A:	Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?
A:	And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh, because you own it?
B:	Uh, that's a hard one because we did that.
B:	But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it.
B:	I'll, uh, you know,
B:	the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.
A:	Yeah.
A:	isn't  there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun?
B:	Uh,
B:	I have no idea.
B:	I've only  had one gun
A:	Because I   have,
B:	and I've kept it, you  know, the one gun that was in my name.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it registered?
B:	Yeah.
A:	The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered,
A:	and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it
A:	but the, uh,
B:	I don't think you have to register a shotgun
A:	Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary
A:	The, uh, the,
B:	Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.
B:	If they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns. private citizens
A:	Yeah.
B:	this,
B:	my kid is jumping on me.
B:	I can't hardly talk.
B:	My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I guess that could happen.
A:	It's just like the, uh, the social security system
A:	Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number
A:	and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.
A:	And  once they have your number, they have your identification.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And everything about you.
A:	And , that's true
B:	Uh, I,
B:	you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh,
B:	my kid is banging.
B:	I was seeing what they was banging on.
B:	Uh, I've lost my train of thought.
B:	I'm sorry
A:	That's all right.
A:	You, you were talking about, uh, uh, what the Federal government knows about people.
B:	Oh, the
B:	Yeah.
B:	They, they probably know everything from, half the time what time you go to the bathroom.
A:	They probably do.
B:	No,
B:	that's that's a little bit extreme.
B:	But they could know anything and everything about you.
B:	And, uh, I'd like to have my gun.
B:	If they go to banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun
B:	but we wouldn't lose our our, uh, shotgun.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I don't, I don't, uh
A:	Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not registered?
B:	No.
A:	No.
A:	I don't either.
A:	I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.
A:	Just  you know, put up the money.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, you can look in the, uh, the,
B:	we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a, a it's a, it's a bargain thing.
B:	Uh, you go and you know, always see guns in there. Five to seven guns a day.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It comes out every Tuesday.
A:	And there's, there's no waiting period on that.
B:	No.
B:	None whatsoever
B:	You call,
B:	we sold a refrigerator through it
B:	and it took us all of twelve hours.
A:	To sell the refrigerator?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.
A:	Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.
A:	I, I don't believe in, uh,
A:	I'm I shouldn't probably say control.
A:	I mean regulation.
A:	Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have.
A:	Uh, but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I agree with you there.
B:	They do have too much control over us already.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.
A:	Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,
A:	so I can't complain too much.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I guess so.
B:	I don't know.
B:	They're
A:	Well, I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself,
A:	but, uh, Uh, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.
B:	No,
B:	I haven't either.
A:	I've, I've always felt for a long time that I, I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	Most countries require that now,
B:	they you know, they have, uh, it mandatory for, for the, the uh at least the young men,
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know about the young women,
B:	I don't know if they have to serve in the military,  too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	a lot,
A:	yeah,
A:	well, you take Israel
A:	I mean, everybody does.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I don't think it's a bad idea,
A:	teaches, teaches a lot.
A:	I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, uh, stayed in for ten years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, did a lot of growing up.
B:	I bet.
B:	You have to.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	my father had been in the military.
B:	I didn't do it myself.
B:	My father had
B:	and that's, uh, how he put himself through school basically.
A:	Yeah.
B:	He came from a poor immigrant family,
B:	and he didn't have a chance to, uh, you know,
B:	the family wasn't wealthy,
B:	so he had to do something to,  put himself through school,
A:	Do it himself.
B:	and he did.
B:	And he was very successful.
A:	Well, my parents wanted to send me to college,
A:	and I was dead set against it
A:	You know, I had wanderlust, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I got in,
A:	and after, after wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something.
A:	So I started to work on my education.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Course my job was such that I didn't, I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree.
B:	That's pretty good.
A:	But, I've been in school ever since
B:	That's good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I guess.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, uh,
B:	I don't know.
B:	There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean if you don't like,
B:	I mean, working in the national parks, Uh, working, clean up the roadsides
A:	Sure.
A:	Exactly.
B:	I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, to go out and clean up the roads. You know,
A:	Oh yeah, Absolutely.
B:	I mean,
A:	All these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients,
A:	and if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks  places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we'd learn service to other people   in this country.
A:	Sure ,
A:	sure.
A:	So I'm,
A:	get something out of that money.
B:	Country would benefit,
A:	Yeah
A:	I've,
B:	I mean, uh,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	my next door neighbor when I was growing up, worked for the unemployment division,
A:	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
A:	and,
B:	That right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and he, he had all kinds of horror stories.
A:	You know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks,
A:	and, back, back in those days they also use to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this
B:	Yeah.
A:	They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I'm, I I have a hard time dealing with that.
B:	What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I was astounded.
B:	I don't even make that.
A:	No,
A:	I know.
A:	I, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,
B:	Yeah,
B:	and somebody's taking that away.
A:	and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
B:	Yeah,
B:	no doubt.
A:	You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,
A:	and now, I, I, I, uh, started out when I first got in graduate school
A:	I was going into public administration,
A:	and, uh, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more.
B:	Is that right,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You sit there
A:	and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need.
A:	Well, you need X number dollars for the recipients
A:	but you need X number dollars to administer the program.
A:	Well just ridiculous.
B:	Yeah.
A:	This is ridiculous.
B:	It's sad.
A:	It is,
A:	it's pathetic.
A:	I mean, there's got to be a different way.
A:	There's got to be a better way.
A:	But it'll never happen.
A:	I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	What would happen if the required young people to do service to the country,
B:	what should they get in return, I wonder.
B:	Like, uh,
A:	I think, I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,
A:	and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Give an incentive.
B:	Educational or vocational training or something.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Something that's going to help them along the way.
B:	And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,
A:	Sure,
A:	I mean,
A:	Well, this,
A:	I mean I mean, look at the statistics,
B:	and that's only going to help.
A:	I mean, it's sad.
A:	One in five Americans can't read
B:	Yeah.
A:	adults, that is, can't even read.
A:	And, and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, what are we, what are we becoming?
A:	We're becoming a service country.
B:	As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we were an industrial giant,
A:	and now we're we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game.
A:	We taught them how to do it,
A:	and they, they did it better than we do.
B:	Yeah
A:	Simple as that.
B:	because they have the ambition, I guess.
A:	yeah,
A:	simple as that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	which is good for them,
B:	but on the other hand, we kind of lose out.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's terrible for us.
B:	I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, and it can be good for them, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah.
A:	I mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got now ...
B:	Oh god, you go to the mall
B:	and you see, you know, fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, you know
A:	I know.
B:	for what.
A:	I know.
B:	Give me the money
B:	and I'll, I'll teach them something good
A:	Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, that's my other complaint.
A:	Parents aren't parents any more.
B:	No.
B:	They've, they've relinquished their parenting.
A:	Yeah.
A:	One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I mean, I talked with somebody else about that another time,
B:	and, you know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program.
B:	And I just love teaching.
B:	That was a lot, that's probably the most fun I had.
B:	And, uh, it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And when, uh, when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach.
B:	But you know, for, for what.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life.
A:	Exactly.
B:	I mean, that, that's a sad thing to think,
B:	and that's kind of selfish on my part,
B:	and I admit that,
A:	Well, in a way it is,
A:	but you have to look out for yourself you know,
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's right.
A:	I mean, that's
A:	and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,
B:	That's wrong.
A:	Yeah,
A:	gosh,
A:	I mean,
B:	I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,
B:	I saying teachers should be paid more.
A:	No,
A:	I mean yeah.
A:	They do an absolutely necessary job,
A:	I mean, I, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, we need,
A:	what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids.
B:	Yeah
B:	They both have their place.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, they,
A:	sure.
B:	But, you know, when it gets right down to it,
A:	I mean, one's
A:	I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars.
B:	That's pretty good.
A:	Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, my other pet peeve is unions.
B:	Yeah,
B:	oh yeah.
A:	You know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone.
A:	There was a time when unions were needed.
B:	And they served a good function.
A:	And they served a good function,
A:	but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,
A:	and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure.
B:	I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management.
B:	It was a steel manufacturing place,
B:	and they, uh,
B:	this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap,
B:	and they were having a hard time.
B:	And they told the strikers there, look,
B:	we need you to come back and get this stuff done.
B:	Or else we're going to be out of business.
B:	And they wouldn't come back,
B:	so they went bankrupt.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, and they all lost their jobs.
A:	Sure,
A:	and, and   and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.
B:	And it's like , you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So many times, I mean, you had the, uh, the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time.
A:	And, well, that took care of that industry
B:	That's right.
A:	and, and, then, and I'll tell you,
A:	Detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country.
B:	And they're trying to do that now with the imports.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, you know, we've never caught up,
A:	and I don't think we ever will.
B:	It'll be a tough road, though.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean, here it is,
A:	and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know And they only did it because they, I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's about right.
A:	Gosh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, back to the original subject,
A:	yeah,
A:	I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service,
A:	I don't care what kind it is.
B:	It teaches them pride in their country.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and pride in themselves, too.
B:	That's right.
A:	They could, they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.
B:	Yeah,
A:	I mean,
B:	that's right.
B:	That's like Eagle Scouts.
A:	Sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that's a great idea.
A:	I think they ought to take them and, I don't know, just have sort of like a, a, a manpower pool and say Okay, look,
A:	we need somebody ...
A:	Okay,
A:	we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it.
B:	Okay.
B:	Fantastic.
B:	Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's amazing, uh,
A:	I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing, uh.
B:	Right.
A:	When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching,
A:	'cause I did some teaching part-time
A:	and I really enjoyed that
A:	but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,
A:	it just, you know, all the problems.
B:	Oh, Lord, I mean, yeah,
B:	an, you talk about stress and pressure,
B:	I tell you what,
B:	it's, uh,
A:	Yeah,
A:	they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,
A:	I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.
B:	Do,
B:	right.
A:	And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.
B:	Exactly,
B:	and,
A:	And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know.
B:	That's right,
B:	and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, I
B:	what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.
B:	You know, it's, uh,
B:	I just don't understand that.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's, uh.
A:	Now do you have little kids, or what?
B:	No, uh,
B:	sure don't,
B:	my wife and I've just been married about two years
B:	but I have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher,
B:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old.
B:	Okay.
A:	So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that.
B:	Okay,
B:	so it's getting close.
A:	Yeah,
A:	he's going to be going to kindergarten,
A:	so.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that.
A:	What's that going to be like.
A:	Are they going to be taught nothing,
A:	or they going be taught something,
A:	we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education.
A:	We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, uh,
B:	Right.
A:	but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,
B:	Exactly.
B:	Right,
B:	that's true.
A:	and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or understand some science. You know,
B:	Exactly.
A:	I mean give me a break,
A:	that's, that's, that's bogus.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, are, uh, private schools. You know whether, uh, uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're growing up, because, you know, just in the Dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And Dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.
B:	Right.
A:	I couldn't believe that.
B:	Right.
B:	You know, one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano.
B:	We were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding.
A:	I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way
A:	but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.
A:	That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit.
B:	That's,
B:	yeah,
B:	and, you know, that's,
B:	taxes right now are political suicide. You know,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and I don't think any politician's going to do that,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,
A:	if it works at colleges it will work down below.
B:	Right.
A:	And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do.
A:	But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more.
B:	Exactly.
B:	And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think. Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's right.
B:	So, uh,
A:	And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything,
A:	I mean, good grief what's .
B:	Yeah
B:	now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know.
A:	I can't believe that.
A:	I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened.
A:	You never heard about that.
B:	Well yeah,
B:	we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know
A:	No.
A:	And now, you know, what do we have now.
A:	You know, got kids that, either got a, you know, a Magnum gun school,
A:	like good grief.
B:	right.
A:	I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean teaching, or even being a student
A:	and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school.
A:	What's going to happen?
A:	I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go.
B:	Exactly,
B:	right.
A:	But there again , you can't hold them back.
B:	Another reason,
B:	and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,
B:	but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,
A:	and that was,
A:	well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine,
A:	so.
B:	Okay.
A:	That was what, twelve years ago, I guess.
B:	Right.
A:	So, you know, it's lot different now.
A:	And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, uh, oldest son is in high school.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's right.
A:	I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it.
B:	That, yeah, that is a scary thought,
B:	but, uh, I don't know,
B:	I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that you can deal with the problems as they come up.
A:	That's all you can do.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and.
A:	You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,
B:	Right.
A:	still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. You know,
B:	Exactly.
A:	an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.
B:	That's right.
A:	And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,
A:	the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera.
A:	They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.
A:	I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,
A:	but, it just is amazing, you know,
B:	Right.
A:	need to teach them good values.
B:	That's true,
B:	that's true,
B:	and, uh.
A:	Of course, if I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, oh no.
A:	And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know.
B:	Right.
B:	Well and I think, uh, you touched on it, you know,
B:	you've got to start them at the home. You know
A:	Yeah.
B:	that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values
B:	and, and, and, uh, and that's about right.
A:	That's all you can do.
B:	Then you just have to hope and pray that, that everything, uh, works out, works out okay,
B:	so.
A:	That's right.
A:	Well I got to be going,
A:	so, uh.
B:	Okay,
B:	well, hey, I appreciate the call.
A:	Nice talking to you today.
B:	You to.
A:	Have a good life, uh.
A:	Hi, Wanet is his last
A:	How are you?
B:	I'm doing fine.
B:	Where you from?
A:	I'm from New England.
A:	Massachusetts.
B:	Okay.
B:	I'm from Berkeley, California.
A:	Wow!
A:	This is quite a, quite a long distance.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it certainly is.
A:	Do you have any pets?
B:	No.
B:	Use too.
B:	Use to,
B:	but none, none right now.
A:	How come, uh, you don't have any now?
A:	You get tired of them?
B:	Well, I, I live in an apartment building
B:	and, and, uh, and, and, it, it, it's just not feasible  you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'd love to have a dog, you know.
A:	I've got a little doggy, uh, that I've had quite, uh, quite a long time.
A:	In fact, she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve.
B:	Ah.
A:	And, uh
B:	Is she?
A:	I beg your pardon?
B:	What is she?
A:	She's, uh, uh, uh, a poodle.
A:	Uh, a toy poodle, a toy poodle
A:	and she's,
B:	Ah.
B:	Ah,
B:	my, I got my mom a teacup little mutt ,  not too long ago.
A:	This is a little bigger than a teacup.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, it's funny how, uh, how I, I, uh, acquired this animal.
A:	Uh, when I was, uh, married, my, uh, ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy. That she needed,
A:	uh, the woman needed someone to baby-sit
A:	and, uh, this is what she had told the kids
A:	and she even told me that.
A:	And after the two week period was up, uh, she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it.
A:	Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, uh, you become  you become attached to it.
B:	Oh, for sure.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, I've had this dog now for, for sixteen years
A:	and she's been a lot of company
A:	Uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old
A:	and things are starting to fail.
A:	Uh, I, I live alone now
A:	and she stays in the house all day while I go to work
A:	and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. The, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
A:	and, uh, I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home.
A:	But she's, she's usually pretty good.
B:	Yes,
B:	well. My, my mother has one that's, uh,
B:	it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup
B:	and, uh, it's made such a difference for her.
B:	But, you know, just, I, you know,
B:	the way my mom's presence countenance is, just, just for having a puppy
B:	but, you know, having this dog
B:	she's had it for, I guess three years now. Oh, possibly four.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.
B:	I really would like to, uh,
B:	I'm a disabled person
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I'm unable to, to, really take care of a pet
B:	and if that weren't so, I would certainly have one.
B:	I just, I just,
B:	it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog
B:	yeah .
A:	Huh. Well, you might want to get yourself, uh, an animal that doesn't require much attention. Like a cat.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	uh, I, I, I typically am not a cat person.
B:	I have a friend that, uh, has on occasion, uh brought her cat over for me to keep for, you know, from time to time
B:	And this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen.
B:	And, uh, it would sleep on my chest, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, it's just a great cat,
B:	but.
A:	Well, my, my personal preference is, is a dog.
A:	Uh, I don't know that, uh, that I would ever want a cat.
A:	Oh, I like cats.
A:	I just wouldn't want to own one.
A:	Uh  they're not, uh, they're, they're affectionate
B:	Well, you don't own cats.
A:	but they,
A:	yeah
A:	I don't know,
A:	I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You, they, they own you or, or, you know, grant you with you their presence, you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right
A:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
A:	That,
A:	yes,
A:	we're supposed to appreciate them.
A:	Well, my, my dog when I came home, uh, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door.
A:	I don't know that a cat would do that, uh
B:	Yeah.
B:	I used to have, a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I could just walk in the door
B:	and she knew whether to, to, to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over.
B:	I mean she really could pick up on my mood  uh, the way I walked in the door.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	It was, uh, uncanny like a
A:	Huh. I, I think, uh, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too
A:	So.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know like when she has an accident, I know she's not doing it on purpose.
A:	When when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that
A:	but, but, but, uh, I do
B:	Sure
B:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	Like if I, if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because I was going out. She would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did
B:	Really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's the way,
B:	well, I had that cat that I mentioned, Alfie .
B:	One morning, you know, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box.
B:	Well, for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away, it decided that, that it was going to protest.
B:	And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,  for me. Looking, looking at me eye to eye,  all the time while it was doing it.
B:	All right. Have I got your attention now?
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Animals have a way of talking
B:	Alfie did.
B:	I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day.
A:	I, I don't know that I'd, uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.
A:	Uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me
A:	and I took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able to jump.
A:	She, you know, lost all her activity
A:	and, uh, she stayed there for one day
A:	and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that I take her to a working dog hospital, animal hospital
A:	So I took his suggestion
A:	and I, uh, took the, the dog to a hospital. The dog hospital there
A:	and they said they'd keep her there for three days.
A:	Well, she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
A:	It cost me over five hundred dollars.
B:	Ouch.
A:	Plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did
A:	and, uh, then she recouped.
A:	She was okay for a couple of years.
A:	And then she got sick on me again
A:	and I brought her to a different vet this time
A:	and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything
A:	And, uh, he gave me the medication, the same medication that I gave her the last time
A:	and she was okay
A:	and she's been okay every since.
A:	It's been about two years now.
B:	Huh. Well, that's great,
B:	it really is.
B:	I, I'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, the, see the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive.
A:	What do you want to do?
A:	I probably would have had second thoughts.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Of course, you would.
A:	But what they, well, what they do is, is they say, well it's going to cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
A:	and, and, you know, and it creeps up on you.
A:	You don't know that, uh, you know
A:	You really, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over.
A:	Uh, to give you an example. My mom had an elderly cat who, uh, whoever evidently got a hold of it
A:	and, uh, the cat got sick.
A:	So she took the cat to the vet
A:	and she had the cat there for two days
A:	and then the cat died.
A:	So the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died
A:	and you owe me this bill,
A:	and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat
A:	So, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh,
A:	and she didn't get the cat back.
A:	So, yeah,
A:	they had to pay for all the medical, uh, bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses.
A:	And, uh, you know, she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good
A:	So that  that was kind of a surprise
B:	Really.
B:	Geez.
A:	At
B:	Yeah.
B:	You kind of wonder what really happened.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well even the, you know,
A:	they, they claimed they did the best that they could have have
A:	and then the cat, uh, died.
A:	So
B:	My goodness.
A:	I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them. Uh,
A:	I, I've, I've got a little kitten, uh, that's still, uh, just being born right now.
A:	So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to, uh, to my folks.
B:	Well, that, that, that, that will make their day.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think it will
A:	because they're both in their, in their seventies. And, uh, the cat, uh, although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes, it turns, it turns out to be, uh, uh, a pleasant experience for them.
A:	Uh, I think they enjoy that.
B:	Only work initially.
A:	Yeah.
B:	For cats anyway, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, listen
B:	it's been a pleasure talking to you.
A:	Well, the same here.
B:	And you take care.
A:	Okay.
A:	Bye now.
B:	Maybe we'll talk again sometimes
A:	Okay.
A:	What is that sound?
B:	That's my buzzer at the door
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	I'll let you go.
B:	Okay.
A:	Right
B:	Thank you
B:	Uh, so what do you do to exercise?
A:	Uh,
A:	I, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day off.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, uh, ride bicycles, uh, fifteen, twenty miles, I don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.
A:	I play basketball, uh, couple times a week.
A:	I play softball one night a week.
A:	Uh, that's what I do.
B:	Um.
A:	What about yourself?
B:	That's pretty impressive.
B:	Uh, I guess I bicycle.
B:	Uh, the amount varies
B:	as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I guess a play softball one night a week.
B:	And I backpack a lot over the summer.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's, that's about the extent of it.
B:	I mean, I don't do any of those things particularly, you know, for exercise.
B:	But, uh, I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll sort of, like, do if I feel like I need to go exercise
B:	Uh, but I do it mostly for fun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh, what do you ride, uh, like, a bunch of hills or pretty flat?
B:	It, it, it varies.
B:	Uh, out near my house is pretty hilly.
B:	Uh, but sometimes I bike to work which is about, uh, a fifteen mile trip each way.
B:	And that's mostly flat.
A:	How long does that take you to get to work?
B:	Uh, about forty-five, fifty minutes.
A:	How how does that work, work out with, uh, storing your bike and showering and all that?
B:	Yeah,
B:	it can be a pain.
B:	Uh, basically, uh, I work on a campus
B:	so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the, uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that I did it consistently one year,
B:	I would commute every day, uh,
B:	but it just became such a pain.
B:	I mean we're talking, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes for biking, uh, and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind. And then another half an hour, you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff.
A:	Right.
B:	It was a big hunk, hunk of the day
B:	Uh, and then of course another hour to get back home.
B:	Uh, so I've been doing that less, and, and concentrating more on, you know, light biking when I get home on the evening and then, you know, some more on the weekends.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there?
B:	Not so much.
B:	Uh, I guess mostly I bike on my own.
B:	I've got a touring bike. Uh, though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How about you,
B:	what kind of biking do you do?
A:	Uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it
A:	and I did an, did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, the Cooper Clinic,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I learned all the health benefits of, you know,
A:	I was a solid weight trainer,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise
A:	and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it,
A:	so, once I got into this, uh, internship, I learned all the physiological advantages to it,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I began a program couple, I don't know probably three or four weeks ago
A:	and I did my first bike rally this Saturday.
A:	I did, uh, forty, forty miles,
B:	Um.
A:	and, uh, that's the longest I've ever ridden so far,
A:	I usually, you know, fifteen or twenty.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it was, it was kind of hilly
A:	and it was pretty tough,
A:	but, uh, I'm looking at, uh, doing a lot more of it because, you know, my wife is really into it,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	and I, I kind of held her back a little bit this, this weekend.
A:	She wanted to go, go, go,
A:	but, you know, she wanted to stay with me
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's good to have a partner.
A:	Yeah
A:	it really is.
B:	Are you think of doing any, like, centuries, or ...
A:	Yeah,
A:	that would be cool sometime if I could, you know, work up to that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from Vermont or, you know, that kind of, thing.
A:	Oh.
B:	I mean people seem to get into different aspects.
B:	One is more of a distance,
B:	and one's more, just, you know,
B:	they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.
A:	I've never really looked into that.
A:	That, you know, that's,
A:	my wife would just love that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I may do that sometime.
A:	There again, I'm just kind of a fledgling into this.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've, it's kind of funny.
A:	I called this number
A:	and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I mean, around Texas, you, you got about five or six,
A:	if you live around the Dallas area, you got five or six every weekend to choose from. Because they're really into it.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
B:	Um.
A:	Bicycling is really big here.
A:	I didn't know that, and, you know, until I came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.
B:	Wow.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because I lived in Indiana all my life
A:	and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, or above the age of fifteen or something,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm not sure why that is.
B:	I mean, generally in the Midwest it seems to be less, much less.
B:	I mean, maybe it's because of the winters. Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the West.
A:	Probably.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It, there's a lot of bikers around here.
A:	It's, it's really neat.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,
A:	little TEXAS BICYCLIST, is like a little newspaper that comes out every month.
B:	Um.
A:	It's free
A:	just go to the bike shock, bike shop and pick it up,
A:	and it's got all the rides coming up,
A:	so I guess I'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer, going to a different ride.
B:	Oh, that's terrific.
A:	Yeah,
A:	see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, how long have you been biking?
B:	Oh, I guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so
B:	Uh, you know, I guess last time I did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, yeah,
B:	I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while, uh, until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot.
B:	And so I thought I'd try it, too.
A:	Have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking, to see if it,
B:	No,
B:	I haven't,
B:	no.
A:	because it really, from what I understand, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol
B:	Um.
A:	and, you know, it, uh, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you know, the cholesterol.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Yeah,
A:	so ...
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've, I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, it gets it down to about forty.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Man.
A:	That's, that's hard-core.
B:	On average,
B:	yeah.
A:	When do you get to begin with the winters and all that?
A:	What time of the year do you usually embark on your,
A:	do you ride inside if you can't ride outside?
B:	No,
B:	I'm not that hard-core.
B:	I mean there are some people,
B:	in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow.
B:	They've got a, uh, mountain bike, you know, with the big knobby tires.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, I don't do that.
B:	I basically, I, I pretty much lay off for the winter.
B:	Uh, I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter, you know, because it will help your balance when you're indoor training.
A:	Um.
B:	Uh, but I just, you know, more or less stocked, like an exercise bike and that kind of thing. uh,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	I mean winters are kind of a problem
B:	so, I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking, I guess, this year for just a couple of weeks.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, you know, up here it's only stopped snowing since then.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, but, yeah,
B:	it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good.
B:	It's, uh,
B:	the main, the main thing, I guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know, exercise and a chore I'll lay off it more.
A:	Right.
A:	So you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep a ...
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	I try to go someplace pretty different, you know, every week.
B:	I rotate around, uh, about four different routes, uh, from my house
B:	or I'll sometimes come in the school.
B:	It's nice coming,
B:	it's, it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path uh,
B:	because it's just, it's along the Erie Canal up here.
A:	So, what school is it?
B:	Uh, University of Rochester.
A:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So it's fairly picturesque.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, so it's, it's, it's a good ride
B:	as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	Sounds neat.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's kind of,
A:	I was wondering if I was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else,
A:	but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week.
A:	That's, uh, motivating.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's really good.
A:	Well good talking to you
B:	Oh, it was good talking to you.
A:	and keep up the good work.
B:	Okay,
B:	you, too.
A:	All right.
A:	Take care.
B:	Bye.
A:	Bye.
A:	Okay.
A:	Uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, I'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.
A:	Uh, probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies
A:	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How about you?
B:	Uh, well, I don't actually live in the city,
B:	but I'd probably say that's roughly right.
B:	I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,
B:	but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	What, uh,
A:	is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
B:	Uh, where I live now it's, it's not so bad.
B:	I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it.
B:	Uh, but I do have friends that live in the city
B:	and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?
B:	I live out in the country,
B:	yeah.
A:	How far out from the city, I mean, do you,
B:	I'm about fifteen miles out.
A:	About fifteen miles.
A:	I live in a little suburb, uh, which is, I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it's pretty congested.
A:	We are considered in the country,
B:	Um.
A:	but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
B:	Um.
A:	Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	However, I'm sure they're there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.
B:	Wow.
B:	That's huge .
A:	And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's cut back, you know, considerably,
A:	but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood,
A:	so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
B:	Are there, are there any theories on why this is happening?
A:	Uh, I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Most,
B:	But why?
B:	Why is it happening?
A:	Well, most families, most families are young
A:	and both people are working.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation.
A:	They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.
B:	So they're professionals?
A:	Uh, they classify most of them as professionals.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles,
A:	the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	guns, that sort of stuff.
B:	Um.
A:	Very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.
B:	Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?
A:	Well, uh, the police force, for one,
A:	I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use.
A:	Uh, it's,
A:	oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people
A:	and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	And,
B:	But, I mean, that's going to tend to,
B:	I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
B:	in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit.
B:	The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
A:	Well, the,
A:	course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever,
A:	so they're giving the early release, uh,
B:	Right.
B:	They're doing that in our state, too.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, and it's,
A:	I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh,
A:	but for the,
B:	So you think that would be a deterrent?
A:	That would be, certainly be a deterrent.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires.
A:	You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. Uh,
B:	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
A:	Uh, I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases.
A:	Course, I, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh,
B:	So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.
A:	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, uh, to convict somebody
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes, uh, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow-through with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder
B:	Right.
A:	uh, I know in my case, I, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty-five
B:	Oh, wow.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	and we caught, the individuals got caught,
A:	we, uh, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh you know, the, the forty-five to the head, you know, just the, the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh, you know, the guy only got five years.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system.
A:	So what, what,
B:	Did you, did you sue him under the civil system?
A:	Do what now?
B:	Did you sue him under the civil system?
A:	no.
A:	I'm not real familiar with that.
B:	Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him
A:	Oh.
B:	and,
A:	Well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him
A:	and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job,
A:	he has nothing,
A:	there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, very
B:	But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
A:	Yeah.
A:	They don't do that here.
A:	Course they pay them,
A:	but they don't, you don't,
A:	you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's too bad.
A:	And, uh, you know, and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders,
A:	they, uh, been in jail before
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, uh, deal I hate to see.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
B:	Yeah,
B:	I, I think that's
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars
A:	and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
B:	That's awful
A:	and he goes out and commits it again.
A:	Fact, he's back in jail now.
A:	So, what, what, uh,
B:	Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What, what deterrent does he really have?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
B:	Oh, my God.
A:	and, uh, return offenders have,
A:	they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood,
A:	they'll rob one house,
A:	then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
B:	Right.
A:	Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
B:	Right.
A:	But, uh, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you can, you know, you can get some of us,
B:	Right.
A:	you can't get all of us.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
B:	And that, that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake
A:	Yeah.
B:	here you break in,
B:	and you're going to get shot.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in,
A:	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it helps for a while
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but then just another different set of people come in,
A:	and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state.
B:	Huh.
A:	Uh, I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the, the border.
B:	Wow,
A:	So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's not many from the local communities.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, it's a problem,
A:	and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,
B:	Yeah.
A:	would be a definite deterrent
A:	and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, I, I tend to agree with you.
B:	I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.
A:	Right.
B:	And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship.
B:	And they lose their constitutional rights. You know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
A:	I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
B:	I know,
B:	and I think, I think that's ridiculous.
A:	They, they went to all, all ...
A:	Okay,
A:	have you painted something lately?
B:	Yes,
B:	I have.
B:	That room I showed you.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And then since then we have painted the bedroom.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	another bedroom.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I showed you that one too didn't I?
B:	The brown one.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	the one that looks like a fudgesicle.
A:	Oh yeah
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh heavens.
A:	Well, I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I get, I have that problem with the the ceiling, you know, the, uh, the blown, blown, ceiling. You know where you get around the edge.
B:	Oh yeah.
B:	Well, that is hard.
B:	Now, I asked Janice, or somebody recently how you do that uh, when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff, that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, how do you get the edge though?
B:	How do you get the edge?
A:	The the straight edge?
B:	You just have to be real careful.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	We use, uh, uh, a two inch brush with, uh, on a slant
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes.
B:	But.
A:	Huh. Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too?
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	I think I am going to do it this spring actually.
A:	Oh really?
B:	Yeah,
B:	there are six houses.
B:	See the people that own the house they, uh, pay for anything like that, that we do.  As far as the the materials.
A:	Oh nice.
B:	There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, I am thinking I am going to change it to, uh, something, you know,
B:	the brick is multi color. Mostly earth tones.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that will be nice.
A:	Huh.
A:	Or, two tone, or two tone. You know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	There are some columns that could be painted a different color too.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What color did you paint your house?
A:	White.
B:	On the out,
A:	But, I have a problem.
A:	I can't get up high
A:	and we can't paint the chimney
B:	Well, you have got to get one of those ladders.
A:	We have one of those ladders.
A:	We are just not willing to get up that high.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood, he has done his house
B:	and that is what he,
B:	I was out there last week
B:	and he has finished everything except the chimney.
A:	Well, we did too.
A:	We did it in the fall
A:	and it, it's just too high.
A:	It is really scary,
A:	but and the only thing I would consider doing, a professional, maybe doing that,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but it
A:	other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.
B:	Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco,
B:	but we had all this trim to paint, and lots of it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
B:	and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he came with, with his own
B:	what do you call those things?
A:	The blowers?
B:	No,
B:	those where you built like a rafter thing.
A:	Oh, oh, oh, oh, I know what you are talking about. Uh
B:	Yeah.
B:	Scaffold.
A:	scaffold.
A:	That's it
B:	He came and did it that way
B:	and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up.
A:	Huh.
B:	And literally I wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus
A:	Its,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and if he fell, he was dead
B:	and he knew that
B:	So,
A:	Oh, my.
A:	So that was worth it getting a professional for that.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Plus, he cleaned up my mess.
A:	Oh, I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney,
A:	but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It wasn't too bad.
A:	I mean you think,
B:	How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside?
A:	Shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Since, it is a one story,
A:	but we did, uh, like two heavy coats over it.
A:	But then that way  you know you are assured you did a good job than you are, you know, if you hire someone to do it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	But, that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to, uh, I guess to buy his paint
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and yet he bought like seventeen gallons.
A:	My word.
B:	And, anyway, he, when he checked out and he was using his charge card too. They only charged him for one gallon of paint. Like thirteen bucks or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	And he had, he had, the, uh, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so she had to start all over again
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something.
A:	Oh, my word.
B:	And he saw .
A:	So that was really worth it. Painting his own house.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.
A:	Oh, my word
A:	Oh, my word.
A:	Well, he really saved in that way.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, yeah,
A:	I think we are going to do, uh, another bathroom,
A:	but I think I will probably just do it, in a roller.
A:	I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little,
B:	Uh. Rollers are so messy.
B:	We never any more.
A:	Oh, I know.
A:	But it's that, it's the textured wall.
B:	Well, a little paintbrush,
B:	So what do you think?
A:	Uh, the causes of crime?
A:	Um, I think it was imbalance of power in the United States.
A:	It's causing the lower class to rebel.
A:	That's why there's such high crime,
A:	and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have role models
B:	Yeah.
A:	see too much crime on T V
A:	and they think it's the way to go.
A:	I don't know.
A:	What do you think?
B:	What about,
B:	I agree with the upper and lower level, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because that's the lowest thing for themselves,
B:	plus there's nobody for them to look up to.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I also blame some of it on parents
A:	Okay.
B:	because parents aren't parents.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because I remember even when I was growing up,
B:	I'm thirty-five
A:	Okay.
B:	I remember when I was growing up,
B:	and I had friends,
B:	they used to do stuff like, you know, go over to a store and steal stuff.
B:	My mother warned us, it's like, I don't care what your friends do.
B:	If you do it, then that was it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I knew that I would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else.
A:	From anybody else.
B:	And I think that's the basic, is they have no morals any more,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so they don't care.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think I can agree with that too.
B:	But now, as far as what they can do about it, I don't know.
B:	You can't make parents be parents
A:	That's true.
A:	You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing.
B:	You know.
A:	I don't know how you do that.
B:	I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,
B:	that's another problem with the United States,
B:	there's no jobs any more.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But.
A:	Well, I've heard this one theory, that if, that if a kid commits a crime, that, uh, instead of the, prosecuting the kid, they prosecute the parent.
A:	Or both of them.
B:	That would work to a point,
A:	Now, to put the blame on the parent.
B:	Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway.
B:	I don't care what you do to them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know,
B:	so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because a, a, a child can get into anything
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't care how good you, they are.
A:	Yeah.
B:	at least one time,
B:	but now if this is a repeated thing,
B:	here with this child in juvenile,
B:	and or, to me, yeah, both of them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do.
B:	Because I just watched it on T V one night on one of them, um, Twenty Twenty, Forty-eight hours, one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know if you seen this.
A:	Um.
B:	it was a little, it was a little gang of them stealing cars, you know,
A:	No,
A:	I didn't see it.
A:	I understand.
B:	And then when they caught him, you know, his mother sitting there,
B:	now they going to take me away from you.
B:	That meaned she was warned.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late.
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know,
B:	but I'm sure there's something can be done.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What about with adults?
A:	Anything do any about adult crime.
B:	Yeah,
B:	start prosecuting they
B:	but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded.
B:	Well, they should start with, the,
B:	if they would get rid of.
B:	Seems to me, I know there's a lot about court that people don't understand.
B:	There's more people in jail right now for child support, okay then there are for people doing drugs.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um.
B:	You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people
A:	Yeah.
B:	let them go,
B:	let them go
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, give them a fine, whatever,
B:	make them do civic duty whatever,
A:	Yeah,
A:	I mean seriously,
B:	Put them fools in there,
A:	they ought to put those people to work.
B:	I call them all fools, idiots, whatever.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Little rock stars, put all them in there.
A:	Um.
B:	You know, the murderers, the drug dealers, the user, put them all in
B:	jail you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and let all the normal people go
A:	Yeah.
B:	you know, because, okay,
B:	if you write a bad check, you go to jail, right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Let them people go.
A:	Well.
B:	Not let them go and get out of it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they, you still have to punish them.
B:	Let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know, like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time, you know, whatever that is
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's,
B:	But don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and they're, they're still, they can provide for society,
A:	whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
B:	I don't know,
B:	some people, boy, they got,
B:	I think the United States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's true.
B:	Now how they going to fix it, I don't know.
B:	I don't think there is a ready solution.
A:	No,
A:	I don't think so either.
A:	Uh.
B:	Because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the pole is getting more of the, I guess, the bulk of it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet.
A:	And they keep taking more money from us
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and people are get,
A:	and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Might as well steal,
A:	then they don't have to pay taxes on it
B:	That's it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, you know, they, I, I, I know that's bad, but, you know, just like Texas now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They could have had a lottery.
B:	They don't want a lottery.
B:	Why not?
B:	I would rather pay for a lottery a dollar, two, three dollars, whatever I'm paying, you know a week or whatever, and never see any of that money, than to have them take a portion of my paycheck.
A:	They'd have a,
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Because, you know, they take,
B:	and Uncle Sam takes his,
B:	the Social Security which probably won't be here when I get that old you know.
A:	Um.
B:	Because we're paying for Social Security they using now.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Who's going to pay for mine?
A:	I don't know
B:	But it's, it's
A:	I'm not counting on it.
B:	No,
B:	you don't count on Social Security.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, it's, it's,
B:	that's what I'm saying,
B:	they need to do something else.
A:	Um.
B:	But.
B:	Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it's going to get worse.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's just like last night they killed them people in that store.
B:	Where you at?
A:	I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
B:	Oh
B:	No wonder you don't know that.
A:	Well, where are you from?
B:	I'm in Dallas.
A:	Okay.
B:	But last night, they killed, uh, uh, four people in a chain food.
A:	Oh, man.
B:	And killed them,
B:	well, it was two stores side by side.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	One was a store and one was like a, a fast food place,
B:	chicken or something, I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women,
B:	I mean, they just beat them.
B:	Stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all.
A:	Ow.
B:	Why was, you know, why
A:	Why did they do in the freezer?
B:	you know, why didn't they just,
B:	if they was going to lock them, just lock them in the freezer, take the money, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything.
A:	Um.
A:	Um.
A:	That's awful.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we still get some in Raleigh.
A:	I mean, not not too often real bad ones,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but.
B:	It's just getting really ridiculous down here.
B:	I wish I could move somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country.
A:	I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.
B:	Well, I think, if it's,
B:	the town is smaller
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and everybody knows everybody
A:	Yeah.
B:	it's harder to come in there and do something.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Where is,
B:	and, and, and see that's another thing.
B:	Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.
A:	Yeah.
B:	There's nobody is next door to you,
B:	you don't know your neighbors, and stuff like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's just, huh-uh, you know,
B:	because I moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers.
A:	Um.
B:	And you didn't even,
B:	and what the manager, the manager won't even do anything.
A:	He's probably a drug dealer himself
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You never know.
B:	You don't.
B:	And so I moved,
B:	because I moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up you know,
A:	Wow.
B:	and this is like across the street.
B:	This was a nice part of town
A:	Um.
B:	and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that, making that, um, crack stuff
A:	Um.
B:	and then, the other time I saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner.
B:	I say, See, this is it.
A:	Time to go.
B:	That's it,
B:	and I moved.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, you know, now I live in like a a neighborhood in a town house,
B:	but it's nice.
B:	I don't, you know.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I'm kind of in the same, same kind of deal, town house in a neighborhood.
B:	But,
A:	It's pretty nice.
B:	I don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex.
B:	That's what happen, that's what wrong, you know.
B:	I don't think, don't rent to them
A:	Yeah.
B:	Or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers.
B:	Put it on the lease.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you deal drugs, you can't live here.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Most of them are too scared to do anything about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	All right.
A:	Well listen, I got to go.
B:	All righty.
A:	Nice talking to you.
B:	And I thank you.
A:	All right.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Um, all right.
A:	I've, uh,
A:	as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,
A:	and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, well, I tend, I tend to agree.
B:	Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,
B:	in some ways they're for the better
B:	because I think women should have a choice,
B:	and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.
B:	But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,
B:	that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.
B:	I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.
B:	There are more things to work out.
B:	I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,
B:	so you have added stresses from there
B:	and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home
B:	and that doesn't change, you know,
B:	just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away
B:	and the other responsibilities are still important.
B:	Um,
B:	so, um, have you, have you worked outside, also and, um, feel that, it, that,
B:	well, how do you feel, as far as, uh,
B:	what would be a happy medium
B:	or, or what would you like to see?
A:	I would like, uh,
A:	yes,
A:	I have worked outside of the home
A:	and, I was in one of those safe occupations.
B:	Yes.
A:	I was a school teacher,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh, we,
A:	uh, then I stopped teaching after my husband's business was established,
A:	and we had two children
A:	and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children
B:	Yes.
A:	and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,
B:	Yes.
A:	which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun
A:	and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,
B:	Right
A:	because your fighting for your life.
B:	But,
B:	yeah.
A:	But, I am a fighter
A:	and I've always been a disciplinarian.
A:	Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.
A:	I think they're going in by choice.
B:	Oh, I think so.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
A:	And, and I have no problem with that,
A:	but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.
A:	And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They are very aggressive.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And they have to be in charge.
A:	And, and I I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Children Well, what do you think, ater running
B:	though, um, um,
B:	I don't know.
B:	I,
B:	the, the one problem I guess I have,
B:	and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,
B:	I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.
B:	Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,
B:	but I know when I was working,
B:	and I was an engineer so I was always with men,
B:	uh, and they were single, many of them,
B:	and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,
B:	I used to leave at three, I keep going to eleven at night
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,
B:	they'd say, oh, I bet you go home and,
B:	you know, at least you get out of here at three
B:	and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,
A:	Oh, sure <laughter>.
B:	and I used to be infuriated,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.
B:	Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.
B:	Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, there's a lot of truth to that
B:	and I don't know how you feel.
B:	I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,
B:	but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.
B:	And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,
B:	you, you,
B:	once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I wish I was the one,
B:	I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,
A:	If my wife had an education and could support us,
A:	and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,
B:	<Children> Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	because I see my sons-in-law,
A:	I have a daughter who's a nurse
A:	and I have a daughter, who's a beautician.
B:	Right.
A:	And I see, my sons-in-law cooking and, dropping children off at the sitter and, picking children up from school and, and having a much better relationship with their children, than my husband ever did
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Right <noise>.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	because he, left home at five thirty in the morning,
B:	That's true.
A:	and he got home at six fifteen.
B:	Yes.
A:	And, uh, he ate his dinner
A:	and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.
B:	Right.
A:	So, now the young fathers are having a chance to parent,
A:	and I think, that's an advantage.
B:	And they enjoy it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And they do enjoy it.
B:	I, I see,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you're right.
B:	I see many more men in the supermarket, in the parks with their children,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and I think that is healthy because
A:	And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,
B:	Right.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.
B:	Yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads,
A:	and they have to, that kind of job, uh, to go out there and shovel that tar and, and drive those big trucks.
A:	And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and at one point we sat down, uh,
A:	I didn't realize it,
A:	but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And here's this young girl with the tattoos
A:	and she has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she'd been,
A:	and I ask her how old she was
A:	and she was the between the age of our daughters
A:	and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I thought, gosh,
A:	I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I guess I'm I'm maybe Victorian
A:	and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist,
A:	in that, he's a very considerate person,
A:	but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and, and in the home,
A:	and she should vote,
A:	but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.
B:	Oh, boy <laughter>.
A:	Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things, too,
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, uh, I like being taken care of.
A:	I like my luggage, carried and, my door opened,
B:	Well,
A:	and I think the young women are losing that
A:	and I think that's sad.
B:	well, that, that's true.
B:	There is that part, too,
B:	and I guess we also have to examine though
B:	and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as, you know, anybody else,
A:	He was raised in the south,
B:	um,
A:	I think that's a little condition,
B:	I guess ha-,
A:	both.
B:	Oh, oh, yeah.
B:	And, and you have to, I guess you have to question too, why a lot of the men, especially, I think middle age and older men, why they feel that way
B:	and, and I think it gets scary for them to see change, also.
B:	They've been used to being, really to be honest, in, in society, and in a way, number one,
B:	and they come home
B:	and everything's done for them.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	And their meal is served
B:	and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching.
A:	Sure.
B:	And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.
B:	Now, my husband is, um, he's ten years older than me,
B:	and,
B:	but he has, his attitudes are very much pro-women, pro-career, which is kind of interesting.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, oor you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.
B:	I'm kind of more,
B:	alking to someone in background, thank you, esumes talking to speaker A
B:	I'm kind of more middle of the road.
B:	I think that when children are small, I think it's okay for women to work especially,
B:	there should be some, a lot more part time,
B:	but I think it's, um,
B:	I don't believe in this career, you know, this career drive when, when they're small, because I think,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	alking to someone in background, they're downstairs esumes talking to A
B:	I think that's very, um, unfair to, to children,
B:	like, uh, engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	I refused to work more than thirty.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I was part-time
B:	and even that was a rat race,
A:	Huh.
B:	but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.
B:	I didn't want, I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and I'm away and, uh,
B:	so I think you can have both.
B:	It's more hectic,
B:	but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need, first then
A:	I think a lot of, my problem with the young mothers ...
B:	Talk about the activities that we don't do
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I don't have any children,
A:	so,
A:	but I, I have a lot of friends with children
A:	and I know they spend a lot of time with them.
A:	Which is good, you know.
B:	That's good to hear.
B:	Yeah,
B:	an, I haven't, uh,
B:	well I've been around a lot of people lately at at my job that don't have a lot of values
B:	So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other,
B:	and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together.
A:	Yeah,
A:	have a lot of values,
A:	I love that.
A:	Do they have children?
B:	Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't,
B:	but she's married,
B:	and I, I'm not quite sure why.
B:	I, I think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him.
A:	Oh, that's wonderful
B:	But, it, it's kind of weighed on me
B:	and then the other day my husband and I met a couple who, who,
B:	they're just going to have their first child
B:	and they really like each other.
B:	And they're real happy with one another
B:	and she says things like, I'm really glad when he comes home
B:	and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening
B:	and,
A:	Oh, that's neat.
B:	I'm like, really.
A:	That's good, you know,
A:	I like to see that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I have, uh, some friends that, uh,
A:	first of all, uh, the girls joined,
A:	they have two girls,
A:	one joined the Girl Scouts
A:	and the other was in the Brownies
A:	and then the mother got involved as a leader
A:	and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp here in Dallas and then going out to, uh, Betty Perot camp and working with the horses and stuff
A:	and they're gone a lot
A:	and they take their girls
A:	and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even, you know, to do work with the Girl Scouts
A:	and I think it's neat.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You know, they've really become very much involved in, in just that one organization,
A:	which the organization can use the help too.
B:	Right.
A:	So, I, I wish I could see more of that, you know.
B:	On Sunday we just met, uh, a family,
B:	we were thinking about getting cat
B:	and we went over to, uh, lady that breeds them here in town
B:	and, uh, her daughter actually was,
B:	she said that her husband said to her daughter, you need a hobby,
B:	so, she chose the cats.
A:	Oh.
B:	And you can tell, it's a family hobby.
B:	they're all a part of it.
B:	And it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and, and the cats
B:	and they raise champion cats.
B:	So, they've done really well.
A:	Ugh,
A:	those are neat cats, too.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've just learned about that breed.
A:	They're really nice looking cats.
A:	I have seven cats
A:	but they're all mongrels
B:	Well that's what we're going to end up getting
A:	Well they're the ones that need the homes.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You know, mine were just all, uh, strays in the neighborhood.
A:	Little baby kittens dropped and stuff
A:	and it just kind of built.
A:	One at a time, just
A:	I couldn't, you know.
A:	One time two of them came at once
A:	and I can't turn a hungry cat down.
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	So, you know,
A:	and the last one that I was here, uh,
A:	the kids brought him over and said he was injured
A:	and it was winter time
A:	and I said, I just can not have another cat,
A:	I just can not have another cat
A:	and I looked out there
A:	and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all,
B:	Oh!
A:	and I said, I can't stand it,
A:	I brought him in so.
A:	Those are my children.
A:	We don't have very many activities
A:	but,
B:	No,
B:	I know what you mean,
B:	our cat hates other cats,
B:	and, we've tried to get her to like other cats
B:	and she just, uh, she wants to be around human beings
B:	and she does not want to be around other cats.
B:	So our next, uh,
B:	we're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out.
A:	Ha, ha, lots of luck.
A:	Is she spayed.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	real maternal
B:	We're hoping,
B:	it's our last hope
A:	She'll eventually,
A:	I mean, mine, you know, I have five males and two females.
A:	Everybody's spayed,
A:	everybody's neutered
A:	and we still have a scrap every now and then.
A:	Nothing real bad, you know,
A:	a slap here and there,
A:	but, uh, they put up with each other
A:	and they will eventually.
A:	her nose will be out of joint for a while
A:	and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then,
A:	but they'll, she'll finally accept it.
A:	You know, they really don't have any choice
B:	They
A:	In my household, we have a little bit, of, uh, a fight for whose boss.
A:	I mean a male cats are, are you know, real territorial
A:	and so that's the big battle here, you know,
A:	of whose, whose top dog, top cat, I guess.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, but, uh,
A:	I I don't know,
A:	I don't have a problem with it.
A:	I think they just learn to accept.
A:	And I have two dogs too,
A:	and they've slapped the dogs around too
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Every now and then,
A:	so.
B:	That's true,
B:	they've got to keep them in line.
A:	Yeah
A:	but she'll accept another cat eventually.
A:	As long as you make her feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well those cats were great.
B:	They were fourteen pounds and,
A:	And
B:	oh, they're just gorgeous,
B:	but, yeah,
B:	it,
B:	three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten.
A:	Oh my gosh
B:	And I think of those,
B:	I think of the kittens at the pound.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Three hundred and fifty dollars hispers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	and they are lovely
B:	but,
A:	till whispering Ugh,
A:	house payment
B:	Right.
A:	That is a lot of money.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and then she's saying, you know, you can't let them outside
B:	and you can't do all this stuff
B:	and I'm like, ugh, you know.
A:	I don't let mine out anyway,
A:	but.
A:	I let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then,
A:	but my cats are
A:	I'm afraid, you know, the neighbors will,
A:	people throw rocks at them,
A:	and people run over them
A:	and, I, I just, you know, I just don't.
A:	I know
A:	and, and now they've lost the desire.
A:	Most of them don't even try to you know, to go out.
A:	I just have two that drive me crazy, that I let out in the back, you know,
A:	but I won't let them get,
A:	if they start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.
B:	Oh.
A:	You know, I just worry,
A:	I guess I'm too protective,
A:	but, you know.
A:	I see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood
A:	and too they can catch diseases really easy,
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	just by touching a nose to another cat they can leukemia, feline leukemia,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	We know we try, try real hard to keep them healthy.
B:	Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll have some room to walk around, and not off of a busy street.
A:	Oh, how neat.
B:	We're, we're choosing our house for our cat.
B:	Isn't that bad
A:	People do it for their children
A:	I mean, why not.
B:	Oh, them too
A:	Well you know, why not,
A:	why not.
B:	because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves outside,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, and she doesn't go far
B:	but she just wants to be able to have that freedom.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road,
A:	and.
A:	You're off of the main road, you said?
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably okay.
A:	I'm just real,
A:	I don't know, I guess,
A:	I'm in a neighborhood
A:	and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it gets hard, especially with the cars.
A:	I, every time I see one run over I just, you know,
A:	it makes me sick,
A:	so, you know,
B:	Oh, I know.
A:	but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children,
B:	Yeah.
A:	except that I consider them my children
B:	Yeah,
B:	our cats are our kids
B:	or,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, we, we got married a few months ago
B:	and I'm like, well why can't Ashley be at the wedding
A:	Oh, no.
A:	In, in her little bridesmaid dress
B:	Yeah,
B:	you know, if I could have, I would have.
A:	Well I'm sure it's been done.
A:	I'm sure it has been done.
A:	Well they have weddings for dogs now and cats
A:	and,
B:	Oh.
A:	you know, they have all that parties for them where they dress up.
A:	I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a
B:	Oh, my.
A:	I haven't gone that far.
A:	I'm not that bonkers.
B:	No
A:	You know, my cats do not wear clothes,
A:	an
B:	I, I don't think they'd like to.
A:	No.
B:	I put a bow on her one one day
B:	and Jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person
B:	I took a picture of her
B:	and that was all it, all it lasted for.
A:	do any of your friends have, have, uh, older children that they do anything with.
A:	Do, do you have friends with older children,
A:	or do they just all have young kids.
B:	Um, yeah,
B:	all the ones I know,
B:	my brother-in-law has three young kids seven and on down
B:	and they, they go on family vacations
B:	and, uh, they go, like to go skiing,
B:	the, the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention,
B:	but, uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had contracted chicken pox first
B:	and then she spread it to her, her younger sister and her brother
B:	and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation, where she got better.
B:	So, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention, because she got to go out.
B:	I think she planned it.
B:	She's only five,
B:	but I think she planned it
B:	And she got all the attention from her dad.
A:	Oh, see there,
A:	she needed that, didn't she.
B:	oh yeah.
A:	You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,
A:	I, you know, to I was an only child,
A:	my mother was an only child
A:	so, I, you know, I wasn't raised with brothers or sisters
A:	and I always got all the attention,
A:	so I wouldn't know.
A:	I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's, it's, we can see it work with her,
A:	Tough,
A:	it must be tough.
B:	she's frustrated.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	she, she's the middle one?
B:	Yeah.
A:	So she's never been the only one,
A:	so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's tough, you know ...
A:	So, what do you,
A:	what's your opinion on the, our policy down there?
B:	I don't think we have one.
A:	I didn't know we had one either
B:	Yeah.
B:	I was going to say it's kind of hard to have, have an opinion.
B:	We seem to, uh,
B:	whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support, without,  regard whether it's a democracy or a anarchy, or anything else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I don't,
A:	Yeah
A:	The only thing that I pretty much know about is the Central American policy where, you know, they're just trying to, you know,
A:	military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now,
B:	Well, uh,
A:	and then,
B:	yeah.
B:	And then, of course, there was, there was the, uh, in Columbia, with the drug lords.
A:	Right.
B:	But we just talked a lot.
B:	We didn't actually do anything.
A:	Right.
A:	Well, that's, that's what I was about to say.
A:	We didn't do anything.
B:	I'm actually surprised at anything in Central America, along with Panama.
B:	I'm just kind of surprised we did that.
A:	Yeah,
B:	But, uh,
A:	that is, that is pretty, uh, risky.
A:	I, mean,
B:	Especially, after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I guess they had to finally do something.
B:	Actually Bush has been better at that than I thought.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	He has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than I thought he would.
B:	I always considered him kind of a wimp.
A:	He takes more risks.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Reagan is kind of mushmouth.
A:	Yeah.
A:	He was.
B:	But, but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is, uh, a combination of Reagan and Carter, much as, you know, policy makers.
A:	Yeah.
A:	It seems that the, the policies of pretty much anywhere, not just in Central America, that U S has now is, is, you know, more action than just words, than just rhetoric.
A:	But, you know, we, we back up what we what we say with actions.
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	We have so far,
B:	but we,  really haven't,
A:	I don't know, how long it's going to last.
B:	Of course, we really haven't taken on the drug lords, yet.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'd be interested to see if we do that.
A:	Well, I don't think it's possible because, even though, you know, we're against them, I don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem.
B:	Well, we did in Panama.
B:	We did in,  Saudi Arabia.
A:	Yeah.
A:	But,
A:	no,
A:	but see the thing when Panama was, uh, the, that, uh, Noriega was, uh, was, was, uh, was wanted either the F B I, by the F B I,
A:	and therefore, they had a reason
A:	But, to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because,
B:	It could be an interesting, interesting problem.
A:	Right.
B:	I don't know if they could do it or not.
B:	Did you read Tom Clancy's A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER?
A:	Uh, no.
A:	I didn't.
B:	I think you need to pick that up and read it.
B:	It's quite, uh, it's, it's quite interesting.
B:	It addresses the problem.
A:	Oh, the drug problem?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Actually, he, he wrote that prior to the, uh, Medellin Cartel being exposed.
B:	It was on the stands prior to that time.
B:	It, it's quite timely.
B:	And either he knows somebody
B:	or he has a real good, a real good imagination
B:	because its, it hits pretty close to home.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I don't think we're going to have much of a choice in either Central or South America.
A:	I don't think, uh, I don't think, the, the, uh, problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon.
A:	I mean, you know, it, I think it pretty much got sidetracked with, uh, with the Panama and, and with the Middle East problems.
A:	Things that, that are important take precedent, precedence over the drugs, I think.
A:	I think, I think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front
A:	And
A:	you know, it, it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing,
A:	so they're going to have to go to the source.
B:	Um, yeah.
B:	I think we realize it's failed.
B:	We just don't, we just don't,
B:	nobody,  wants to make the, nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading,
A:	Don't want to admit it yet.
A:	Right.
B:	We still, there's still there's still too many Kennedys and and all up there.
A:	Yep ause.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
B:	There's too many liberals in control.
B:	They can't agree on anything.
B:	And they have blinders on as far as the policy goes.
B:	As long as somebody's getting killed, as long as nobody knows about it it's okay.
B:	But, but the minute it hit, hits the paper then, of course, the Kennedys and the and the and the, and, uh, the from Georgia, all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Of course, these are the same people that also drown the Chappaquiddic, and stuff like that, you know.
A:	Huh.
B:	But I guess it
B:	I guess it's automatic respective.
A:	Depends on how much power you have,  and who you know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You know,  the people have a right to know except about what it, about what concerns them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And these are the people that make the foreign policy
B:	and it, it's probably basically, uh,
B:	I would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of, uh, financial holdings in, in Central and South America.
A:	Probably.
B:	Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway.
A:	Huh.
B:	Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys.
A:	I don't drink Scotch.
B:	Good.
B:	Don't ever drink Scotch,
B:	it's terrible.
B:	I quit drinking Scotch when I found out about that,
B:	but, anyway.
B:	But, uh, as far as, as far as, you know, Central and South America, we, our policy pretty much, uh, it depends on who we're, what government we're buying down there at the particular time.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I,  think we're trying to stay, uh, stay friendly with uh, the, uh, the Brazilian and, and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much, uh, agricultural exports.
B:	We,
A:	We, don't want to piss them off and have them over produce
B:	Yeah.
B:	Although we do need to do something about, you know,
B:	of course, in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras, that's been going on for years.
B:	But then, hell, it's probably still be going on long after we're dead.
B:	It'll still be the same thing.
B:	Those people down there don't really,
B:	I mean,
A:	I think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better,
A:	you know,  the same old cliche.
B:	Well, I think basically,  they can't figure out what they want down there.
A:	Right.
B:	If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy, those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education.
A:	Right.
A:	And they'll just pick crooked people again.
A:	And then people, the, the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again,
A:	and it'll all,  be for nothing.
B:	It's all tradition.
B:	It's all traditional.
B:	They have to,
B:	you have the ruling class
B:	and you have everybody else.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I guess that's about five minutes.
A:	Appreciate talking,  to you.
B:	was very pleasant)).
B:	All righty.
B:	Good,  talking to you.
A:	Hey, what was that book,
A:	what was that book that you were saying to read, again?
B:	Tom, Clancy.
B:	It's called A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.
A:	A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	He he's the one who wrote, uh, RED OCTOBER, A HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.
A:	Okay.
A:	All right.
B:	And I think if you read that, I think you'll get a real kick out of it.
A:	All right.
A:	Thanks a lot.
B:	All righty.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Um,
B:	Hi
A:	one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education
A:	cause I went through the public, um, school system of Boston,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, I always felt that I graduated high school
A:	and I still didn't even I, I couldn't put together a map of the United State.
B:	Um.
A:	You know what I mean.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	An yet I felt that I got a good education
A:	and I, I did well in school
A:	but you tell me to name, you know, five continents
A:	an I, couldn't do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education,
B:	Uh.
A:	and the people are, are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things.
B:	Yeah.
B:	One,
B:	well, talking about public education, um, I'm, we're doing a proposal,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's, we're doing it at N C State,
A:	Yeah.
B:	we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that's kind of in a higher level
A:	Right.
B:	So it's interesting that you chose that topic
A:	Yeah,
A:	um, did you do through a public school system or private?
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I went through private an until ninth grade.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	did you notice a big difference?
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	a big difference.
A:	Like in what sense?
B:	Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there there are a lot of, of, you know,
B:	people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, um, private school you couldn't do that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you had to learn.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I work in a temporary agency
A:	an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they'll have to bring somebody with them,
A:	and they will show that they completed, um, four year of high school,
A:	yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application, they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves,
B:	Uh.
B:	That's bad.
A:	it's just incredible.
B:	Yeah,
B:	our State cut a whole bunch of a, I think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget.
A:	Really.
B:	So they're making all kind of cuts
B:	in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,
B:	and the library canceling all of it's subscriptions.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's pretty sorry.
A:	I know,
A:	um, they, uh,
A:	I forget
A:	I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems, they're closing the libraries.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports, or anything like that,
B:	Uh.
A:	they're not cutting in any other corner
A:	they're closing the libraries.
A:	That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
A:	So do you go to college right now?
A:	Are
B:	Yeah,
B:	it's my last year
A:	You're a, so you're a senior now.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I'm working on my projects trying to graduate
A:	Oh, good for you.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's great,
A:	um, is, is N C University is that, uh, State,
B:	N C State.
A:	What did you say?
B:	N C State.
A:	N C State,
A:	that's a State University then.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I see.
A:	And you're from there also?
B:	Well, yeah,
B:	I was, uh, I was born in
B:	and then I lived in most of my life.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see.
B:	And now I'm back here going to school.
A:	Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It's just a outrageously expensive.
B:	Luckily state is one of the cheap ones.
A:	Oh is it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, still though
A:	I mean, you know, thousands of dollars,
B:	Yeah, state's not that bad
A:	Oh, well, that's good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's good.
A:	I went to a private university
A:	and, um, I don't know
A:	I look back now
A:	and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, um, I have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school, some, some of them,
A:	and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did.
A:	I really do
A:	and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say
A:	but, um,
B:	Yeah,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I, I
B:	Where did you go?
A:	what?
B:	Where did you go?
A:	I went to University.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's in Massachusetts.
A:	And, um, I really felt like I've been working now for about four years,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school, you know,
A:	I, I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art.
A:	But, um, I don't know
A:	my sister's a principal at a school,
A:	and one thing she's trying to instill in kids, um, besides just reading and writing are just some, the golden rules,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	she calls them just some basics about, um, you know, you don't take what's not yours,
A:	uh, and if you want to, you know, you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission.
A:	Like no hitting, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	no pulling hair or anything like that,
A:	and, uh, the school that she's in is a, um, it's basically for minorities,
A:	um, there's a large minority population.
A:	And, um, she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there
A:	I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get, in some.
B:	Yeah
B:	that's, sorry.
B:	That they, that they like pick on the advanced students and pay more attention to them, ignore the others.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I don't know if it makes them feel better
A:	I mean the do teachers get,
A:	I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's not much of a challenge.
B:	That's true.
A:	But do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate.
B:	Um, graduate school
A:	Oh yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Do you know where you're going?
B:	I think I'm going to Chappel Hill.
A:	Where's that?
B:	That's in Chappel Hill
B:	the
A:	Oh is that North Carolina?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	Never heard of the, uh, Tarheels?
A:	No,
A:	I don't know that area.
B:	The A C C Tarheels, U N C?
A:	I know it.
B:	Oh, uh,
A:	I don't get down there very often.
B:	They won the final four, in boy's basket ball.
A:	Oh, really,
A:	well the way I pick the final four was, um, by the state that had the warmest climate.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So that's how I chose all mine,
A:	so you can tell that I really didn't have that much to do with any of it.
A:	But,
A:	so obviously you're into education.
B:	Yeah.
A:	If you can be going,
A:	my husband went to, is in graduate school actually right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
A:	I don't know
A:	I give you a lot of credit.
A:	I couldn't do it,
A:	I, I couldn't wait to graduate and have, it be all over.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I know.
B:	Oh.
B:	I can't wait to graduate either, now.
A:	I know.
B:	I've got all of this stuff due
B:	oh wow.
B:	Overloaded.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I kind of know what you mean.
A:	Well, it was really nice talking to you.
B:	All right.
A:	Okay.
A:	Good luck.
B:	All right,
B:	thank you.
A:	All righty,
A:	take care.
B:	All right,
B:	bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Clanking ishes oman and children
A:	Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something,
A:	I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door
B:	What kind of a car do you have now?
A:	Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight,
A:	and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That same kind of four door, hard top style.
B:	You got kids?
A:	Uh, no
A:	but we're planning for it.
B:	Okay.
A:	So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight
A:	but it's in pretty good in really good shape.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So that's probably where the first place we'd look.
B:	Huh.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership
A:	That'll do it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That'll do it.
B:	Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape.
B:	I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we've got a minivan,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that's great.
B:	And I drive, uh,
B:	well I used to drive an Escort,
B:	but it died on me.
B:	So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day.
A:	Oh, geez.
B:	And, uh, and this Escort took it all.
B:	And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it,
B:	and the engine just went.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Really?
B:	I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it, it it's an eighty-five Aries,
B:	but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it.
A:	Oh, geez.
B:	And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.
B:	So it's just a ten minute commute every day.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh,
B:	I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	But I think, uh,
B:	and it's a four door which is nice,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's still a little cramped.
B:	I've got three kids,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so I, I,
A:	Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's what, I was thinking of,
B:	was a Taurus.
B:	Uh,
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I know a lot of guys at work,
A:	they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh,
A:	and they still want kind of a sports car.
A:	They've been, uh, a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's.
A:	That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus?
B:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah
A:	In fact, it comes with a standard stick
A:	and, uh, and a lot of those.
B:	Ooh.
A:	And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and usually they're in like black, and gun metal grey and those kind of colors.
A:	You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.
A:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, my wife wants a Miyata.
A:	Oh, well sure
A:	That's what, you know,
A:	until, until you look at the price tag
A:	and then you go, What?
B:	Right.
A:	What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
B:	I know,
B:	I know.
B:	It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college.
A:	I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my my first job.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.
B:	Oh.
A:	And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But that, that just does not make it as an only car.
A:	It's, uh, it's like I, I would,
A:	I bought a set of stereo speakers
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it was one of those cash and carry deals.
A:	I had to take them one at a time, with the top down.
A:	And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down,
B:	Oh, no!
A:	and the speaker in the passenger seat.
B:	Yeah
A:	And I drove that one home,
A:	and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home.
A:	And, uh, funny, funniest sight.
A:	And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I,
B:	you know, it's funny.
B:	Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.
B:	I never did that.
B:	Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	And, uh, because I got a good deal on it
A:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, that was a great little car.
B:	Actually I met,
B:	that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never,
B:	I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Boy, that's a good deal.
B:	And, uh, in fact I married one of those people
A:	Ah, okay.
A:	Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again
B:	And it worked.
B:	Yeah,
B:	it worked all right, real good.
A:	Huh.
A:	Because I, I know we've, uh,
A:	that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission.
A:	My, uh, my wife just can't, can't, uh,
A:	she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh, went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive.
A:	We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And we went, uh, we went, uh, we went to a dealership
A:	and, uh, it, it was she, she did pretty well.
A:	But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot
B:	Yeah
A:	and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking,
A:	because that was all it was.
A:	It was, it was the funniest thing,
A:	it was like, uh, a big Le Baron,
A:	it was a Le Baron with everything on it,
B:	Wow!
A:	but it had a standard shift.
A:	It was the craziest thing I ever saw.
B:	That's weird!
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.
B:	Huh.
A:	And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth.
A:	She did pretty well after a while.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.
B:	Well, my wife,
B:	I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, and,
B:	in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.
B:	In fact, the minivan's a, has a stick shift.
A:	Um, okay.
B:	And in,
B:	this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything.
B:	You know, it's got automatic transmission, cruise control, you know, electric locks.
A:	Oh, geez.
B:	You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Oh, well.
A:	Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars
B:	Well, you, um,
B:	the, the thing about this, uh,
B:	I will say this about the minivan.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I would think so,
A:	yeah,
B:	It, it,
A:	because it's so big.
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, and it was quiet,
B:	it had a stereo system.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	We never had it, you know,
B:	we always had the A M radio.
A:	Sure,
A:	sure.
B:	And, uh, of course this has, this that had speakers that you can control from the back seat.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And put speaker phones in it.
B:	So.
A:	Now, now, now that used to be a luxury,
A:	but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory.
B:	Right.
A:	You've got to have that now.
B:	That's right.
B:	That's right.
A:	You're used to it
A:	and you got to have it.
B:	And you've got to pay for it too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That's true too.
B:	And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine
A:	It, It probably does,
A:	it probably does.
A:	But, uh,
B:	We,
A:	Oh, well.
A:	Well, Bill it's been nice talking to you.
B:	Nice talking to you.
A:	Okay,
A:	you have a good evening.
B:	Thanks a lot.
A:	Um.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye
A:	What kind,
B:	What kind of cars do you, do you usually drive?
A:	Right now we, I've got a, uh, four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.
B:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Well, we're, we're, we're sort of, sort of a General Motors family,
B:	I guess that's the way we were raised.
B:	And, uh, uh, we were overseas with T I for a number of years
B:	and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family.
A:	Oh, goodness.
B:	Yeah,
B:	and four cars
B:	and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental.
A:	Really?
B:	At least two of them.
B:	We bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark.
B:	Uh, for, you know,
B:	they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them
B:	and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that.
B:	Uh, then we've got an eighty-six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new.
B:	My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used.
B:	So we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers.
B:	It's like musical chairs
A:	I bet.
B:	You're one short.
A:	I bet.
B:	And, uh,
B:	but you know, it's interesting the two,
B:	even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever
B:	and we were in the retail milk business
B:	and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks
B:	and, and we bought automobiles and all that,
B:	it was almost like
B:	and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend
B:	and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a, but a Chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave
B:	But, uh,
A:	Yep.
B:	as we got older and got away,
B:	and then we thought, well, you know, you still could buy General Motors products
B:	and it was probably not that bad.
B:	But, uh, we lived in Malaysia for T I in nineteen, uh, eighty-one, two, three, and four.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there
A:	No.
B:	But we bought a Volvo
B:	and I have never had a car that I've loved more.
B:	I just can't afford them here.
B:	Uh, but I, I just loved that car.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, we bought a, uh,
B:	we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five, eighty-six, and eighty-seven
B:	and we bought a, uh, Ford Telstar,
B:	which is somewhat similar to the Taurus.
B:	It's sold in, uh, in uh, the Far Eastern uh, Far East countries more than here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But we really liked that.
B:	And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have?
A:	Well, yeah
A:	we had, uh, we had,
A:	these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves.
B:	Um.
A:	The others were hand me downs through the families.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And those were always G M cars.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, we were real happy with them,
A:	but all the ones that we ever had were the, you know, eight cylinder,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	really rugged, G M cars.
B:	The the big,
B:	Yeah.
A:	And all we had heard was, was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars,
A:	and we both drive, well, forty-five miles round trip every day.
B:	Sure,
B:	sure.
A:	And so we wanted a smaller car,
B:	Yeah.
A:	when we got ready to buy, we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage
A:	and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	You know, as far as durability.
B:	Right.
A:	So we kind of,
A:	when we had our larger cars, we didn't mind, uh, keeping them up,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them, all of them, you know,
A:	it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	it seems that something goes every month.
A:	Yeah
A:	it,
B:	And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours,
B:	you know,
B:	we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And we'll probably be there with all of them.
B:	You know, it's the same thing, you know,
B:	I don't know whether, uh, you classify the Skylark and the Calais as,
B:	well I guess they're intermediate.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts
B:	and there were five of us
B:	and five, five of us never go anywhere together here.
B:	everybody's heading off in their own direction.
A:	Right.
B:	And I rented a Buick Le Sabre,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty.
B:	And it made all the,
B:	I, I had forgotten what driving a big car was like.
A:	It's like a yacht.
B:	It was just nice.
B:	It floated.
A:	Yeah.
A:	What,
A:	we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it was a great car.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It just,
A:	we ran the wheels right off of it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah,
B:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, you know I've read,
B:	I'm in the quality business at T I,
B:	I'm a quality manager
B:	and we're, we're uh, we deal,
B:	we sell,
B:	I'm in the semiconductor group
B:	and we sell to, uh, Ford, Chrysler and G M, uh, G M Delco.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And there is a, amazing,
B:	I am just, uh, really impressed with the, with the quality consciousness that the, these companies have put into their procurement
B:	and it's, I, it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, I
B:	and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny.
B:	I mean I was growing up,
B:	I was taught when I was growing up, you know, that, that that real people bought General Motors products,
B:	and peons bought, Ford products.
A:	That's right.
B:	But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants
B:	and they're really, uh, uh, stressing this partnerships in quality,
B:	and you know, G M and Chrysler are doing that,
B:	but I really think Ford's got a ship position in this right now.
B:	And I think it's showing up in their automobiles.
B:	Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament
B:	and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there,
B:	so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down, we'd rent one,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we went up to the local Budget
B:	and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something.
B:	He said I'll tell you what, for a dollar a day more I'll give you a Lincoln Town Car.
A:	Um.
B:	And we drove that down
B:	and I hated to turn that back in.
A:	I bet
B:	We had that for three days.
B:	And I absolutely loved,
B:	except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time.
A:	No.
B:	Uh,
A:	I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either.
B:	but I absolutely loved that automobile.
B:	And, you know, it wasn't that I'd,
B:	driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon,
B:	but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going
B:	so I knew what I actually got on the trip
B:	and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and, you know, we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it, let it float.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, it was pretty nice.
B:	Are, are, are you planning on getting any additional or other cars?
A:	No time soon.
A:	Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.
B:	Um.
B:	Oh, yours is small.
A:	Yes.
A:	So, we, uh, so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon.
A:	Both of our cars are getting, oh, around sixty thousand miles on them.
B:	Um.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	We drive a lot.
B:	Yeah.
B:	You got another, another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we've got,
B:	probably we'll get something in the next couple years.
B:	My son will graduate from high school this year,
B:	and, and he's going to go to Richland College one year behind us,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it's right,
B:	in fact, uh, our house is adjacent to the Richland property.
B:	He wants to go to Texas Tech
B:	and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order,
B:	but, uh, the next year when he goes out to Tech, he wants a pickup,
B:	and I want, a pickup.
A:	A pickup aint.
B:	I may get one and not let him have it
B:	But, we have been looking at these red
B:	they, they're very popular around here.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	These, uh, uh, red Chevy pickups,
B:	and, uh, we'll probably do something like that,
B:	uh, uh, incidentally,
B:	uh, uh, I don't know,
B:	uh, the, uh, the Credit Union has got a deal now where you decide what you want
B:	and you call this number
B:	and, uh, they go negotiate the price for you.
B:	And, and, or, or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, my boss just bought a Chevy pickup
B:	and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way.
A:	Really?
B:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, uh, you know, you, you figure out the options, go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and, and tell him what you want
B:	and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy, a certain person at that dealer's place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one.
A:	I think that would be a good idea.
B:	And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own.
B:	But, once, one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend,
B:	Yeah.
A:	this is the car we want,
A:	will you sell me this car for that price.
B:	And for that price.
A:	And, and we've had
A:	we, with our,
A:	when we bought our Subaru, the guy was like, you can't do this to me,
A:	and we're were just, like, okay fine, we, we won't then.
B:	We'll go somewhere else.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know.
A:	I mean he's like, no, no, no.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But,
B:	And, uh, and I, I think that's probably the way you've got to do it.
B:	When, when I was young, I went in and bought a, uh, or made a deal on a sixty,
B:	this is nineteen sixty,
B:	I'd first come to Texas, and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible that I just loved,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and this guy gave me this deal, you know,
B:	I told him how much I wanted to pay,
B:	and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss
B:	and then I'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate, uh, we would go ahead and buy.
B:	Uh, uh, if he could get this rate I promised to buy
B:	and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted.
B:	I, I was only twenty-five years old or something
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I left there
B:	and I, I, uh, I'd never done this before because I'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from,
B:	and, uh, uh, so I, I got back
B:	and a salesman that lived in the apartment had, asked me, uh, uh, if,
B:	he'd heard I was going to get a car, and asked me what I paid for it.
B:	He said, well, hey, uh, before you go buying anything,
B:	he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point.
B:	There was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning
B:	and just driving fifty miles out of town, it was a difference,
B:	and, I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars,
B:	but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred,
A:	Goodness.
B:	is all we paid for cars in those days.
B:	And, uh, uh, so I called back the guy in Dallas
B:	and I told him that,
B:	I'd left him a check for tax, title and license and everything,
B:	and I said I want to cancel my order and, and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to, I've stopped payment on it already
B:	and he says oh, somebody's taking,
B:	he said what did you get a deal for, Bill.
B:	And I told him,
B:	he says, somebody's taking you for a ride.
B:	And I said, no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday
A:	That's right.
B:	And, uh, uh, and I, I find that, uh,
B:	and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point
B:	and, and the, and the fellow died since then,
B:	and, and some of his relatives have taken over the business
B:	and that,
B:	but
B:	and, since then I had ...
B:	Okay,
B:	well yes,
B:	we do have pollution in Houston
B:	and it,
A:	How bad is it?
A:	Do you have smog like they do in California?
B:	Well it, it
B:	some,
B:	I think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, the cloud cover
B:	and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know,
B:	just, it's hot,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the sun is trying, tries to shine through
B:	but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution
B:	and I,
A:	It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it.
B:	I think so,
B:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston,
B:	I mean it's still part of, it's part of the Houston metroplex.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	uh-huh.
A:	What do you think is your primary cause of it.
B:	Well, I think it's industry
B:	and I think it's cars.
A:	You do?
A:	You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?
B:	I don't, I,
B:	well maybe not,
B:	but, it, it sure, it sure,
B:	you know, it,
B:	I, I know that when I'm, when I'm behind a car
B:	and, uh, sometimes, uh, I can really smell especially diesel and things like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you know, comes right into my air conditioner
B:	and, you know, my head and my
B:	I'm so stopped up right now,
A:	Um,
A:	my goodness.
B:	I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,
B:	that's part of it,
B:	but, um.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think a lot of it's industrial.
A:	I also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles
A:	but it's mostly from older automobiles.
A:	I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think that, uh, I think that, uh, uh,
A:	if, uh,
A:	I, I, I heard a story a while back
A:	something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five, that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	You mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total from that comes from,
A:	Yeah.
A:	From, from cars
A:	that is, not, not total but just from cars,
A:	okay.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	So, that I think would be tremendous help.
A:	But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical
A:	and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service
A:	and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, that may be part of the problem.
B:	Do you all have pollution in your part of the country, uh, from industry?
A:	Yeah, ause
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah,
A:	oh, uh, yeah,
A:	it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here I think
A:	but I think it's mostly industrial, is what I really, uh, believe is the, the main problem.
A:	And, and, uh, ause
A:	and, uh, uh, people, uh, I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should.
A:	I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland.
B:	Really,
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh,
B:	like what
B:	any particular kind or just all kinds?
A:	Well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant
A:	and, uh, I think,
A:	of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,
A:	but, uh, this state was like the second,
A:	my wife's a registered nurse,
A:	and I think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds.
A:	And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution.
A:	I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,
A:	but I just can't believe it is.
B:	Um.
A:	Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two.
A:	They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
A:	and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,
A:	and having all kinds of effects,
A:	and.
B:	Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?
A:	Well they're working now,
A:	I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint.
A:	Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh,
B:	Is that also what's in, uh, aerosol?
A:	Well they used to be,
A:	but they made them take it out of that.
B:	Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,
A:	Right.
B:	but it doesn't have anything that's damaging.
A:	No,
A:	they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	well that's good.
A:	and that was a move in the right direction.
A:	We are doing some things to try to correct the problem.
A:	But there are more things we could do
A:	and getting rid of old cars, like I said is one way to help correct the problem.
A:	Uh, uh, just trying to I think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,
A:	I notice in this state,
A:	I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not,
A:	but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,
A:	yeah.
B:	Here, they've just started, started doing that,
B:	it's, it's, you know,
B:	you're not, you don't have to,
B:	but you know,
B:	I know I am.
B:	I save,
A:	Yeah,
A:	well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too.
A:	But they, uh,
A:	in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police.
A:	They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
A:	and she spot checks people's trash.
B:	No kidding,
B:	really,
B:	oh.
A:	And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash, they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time.
B:	Is that right.
B:	Well, we need to do something,
B:	we need to get serious about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	you,
A:	right,
A:	you've got to get people to see
A:	and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.
A:	They've stopped that up here too.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But that, that will cut pollution too.
A:	Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, I think, decaying and and trying to,
A:	for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But on, on the other hand, I don't guess they're polluting.
A:	But plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,
A:	I'm not sure of that.
B:	How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?
A:	Oh I think that's very important to do.
B:	too.
A:	I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, that can help to cut pollution, I guess some.
A:	I, I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air.
A:	I would hope that they would help some, though.
A:	That's for sure.
B:	I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know,
B:	we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.
B:	I think they got caught.
A:	Oh good.
B:	But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on.
A:	Well that, uh, that I think may go on a lot
A:	and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something.
A:	I don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry.
A:	Uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants
A:	because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content.
B:	Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you all have that?
A:	Uh, no,
A:	we don't have a state inspection,
B:	So,
B:	which I,
B:	I
B:	I would
A:	but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.
B:	So I'm I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety
B:	or,
A:	I don't know,
A:	uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities.
A:	But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three.
B:	But that's all they check for,
B:	they don't check how good,
B:	if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough.
A:	No,
A:	no,
A:	we don't have inspections like that.
A:	Now, I'm in Maryland,
A:	in Virginia they check that every two years, I think.
B:	We do that every year.
A:	And I think that's a good idea too,
A:	not, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,
A:	but I think it's a good idea.
A:	The emission check, though, is required in Maryland
A:	and it's also required in Virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one.
A:	And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants.
B:	Well I'll have to check,
B:	I'm not sure if, if our state inspection
B:	once a year has to do, you know,
B:	if they check the, uh,
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. get around to it,
A:	and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,
B:	Oh, I would
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything.
A:	Oh yeah,
A:	I, I agree.
A:	Now that's another area we haven't even discussed
A:	and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution.
A:	I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution.
A:	But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,
A:	so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food.
A:	But water pollution, uh,
A:	I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know a lot more people are going to bottled water.
B:	Well
B:	and that's not necessarily the answer either
B:	because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap.
A:	Yeah,
A:	tap,
A:	yeah
B:	So,
B:	but a lot of these, uh,
B:	some of this
B:	well, you know, a lot of people have well water,
B:	in fact in this area too
B:	and, an, you know,
B:	and, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking
B:	and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that
B:	and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too, if they don't, they don't get it checked.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked
A:	because it seems, uh,
A:	when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were
A:	and we had a well,
A:	it was one of those draws that,
A:	I forget what you call those things,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and that was some of the best tasting water,
A:	I mean, I can still to this day taste that water.
B:	When we were,
B:	when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and their water supply came from, uh, spring.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it was like ice cold, spring water
B:	and I guess parts of the, the city still you know, get that,
B:	but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful.
A:	Oh, I bet it was.
B:	It was really, really good.
A:	Yeah,
A:	once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh,
A:	it depends of course where you are.
A:	A good well, though, I think is very healthy ...
A:	The Latin American situation in,
A:	the last development I know of was the military and financial assistance Columbia for the, for the drug, uh, control.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I support that fully.
A:	I'm not sure we have the right solution to it,
A:	but at least we're, we're going to the source of the problem.
A:	And,  the source of supply.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, the problem is here,
A:	but the source of supply is there.
B:	That's true.
B:	Very definitely so.
A:	In fact I think a lot of the,
A:	I've been to, uh, Peru several times.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've never been to other parts of South America,
A:	but, uh, I have been to Peru,
A:	and they need some assistance down there
A:	and I'm sure that, uh, as an undeveloped country they look, look for it,
A:	but there is not exactly a lot of, uh, physical responsibility there. *listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical'
B:	No.
B:	Very immature in that respect.
A:	Yes,
A:	right.
A:	And I, I think that, uh, they need guidance and assistance,
A:	but they need to learn how to stand on their own, own two feet also.
B:	I agree.
B:	I think that for so long power financially, uh, governmentally, every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not the middle class that we, we perceive.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, no, the, and the poor are extremely poor.
A:	I know,
B:	Are extremely poor.
B:	That's correct.
A:	I know, uh, some of the areas in, in Texas seem poor,
A:	but until you've seen some of those, uh, native,  Latin Americans come down from the hills, you can't imagine what poor is.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, the worst scene I've ever had I think was, uh, someone eating out of, out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima, Peru.
B:	And, and just very happy to get that.
A:	Oh, yes.
A:	Yes.
B:	I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And this is very much his, you know, reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor.
A:	Oh, the, there's a joke,
A:	the, the graft and the, uh, payoffs down there are are an accepted way
A:	and, in a way,
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	And there's, there's a sad joke.
A:	I guess all jokes are really sad,
A:	but there's a joke about the, uh, Ambassador from Latin America that came to visit a Senator in the U S and was taken to his home for dinner
A:	and the, uh, home was palatial.
A:	They had five or six servants, you know, and, and, a lot of expensive, uh, holdings and all that,
A:	and the Ambassador said, but I know what you make as a U S Senator,
A:	how can you afford all of this?
A:	And he said, come I'll show you
A:	and he walked out in the backyard
A:	and the, uh, Senator said do you see that hospital over there?
A:	And the Ambassador said, yes.
A:	And he patted his pocket
A:	and he said fifteen percent.
A:	He said, you see that school over there?
A:	And the Ambassador said, yes,
A:	and he pot, patted his pocket and said fifteen percent,
A:	so,
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	so the next year the Senator went to Latin America to visit the Ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home
A:	and it was twice as large and four times as many servants.
A:	He said, well I know how poor your country is,
A:	how can you afford this, uh, in such a poor country,
A:	and he, he said, come I'll show you
A:	and he walked out the backyard
A:	and he said, do you see that hospital over there?
A:	And the Senator looked
A:	and he couldn't see anything,
A:	he said, no.
A:	And the Ambassador potted, patted his pocket and said one hundred percent
A:	so,
B:	Yep
A:	Yeah,
A:	that,
A:	it's a sad story
A:	but,
B:	Intentions, intentions
A:	Yes,
A:	yes,
A:	but it, uh, it is a problem.
B:	I know.
B:	Uh, I have a sister-in-law who is from Nicaragua
B:	and her family,
B:	her father was a fairly, uh, high ranking official under Somoza.
B:	And when that went down the tubes they had to get out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And seventeen children,  filtered through into, into America through Guatamala, through Mexico, through Honduras,
A:	Um.
B:	you know, two here, three there, one here, you know, this kind of thing until,
A:	Yeah.
B:	and now, uh, couple of the older ones stayed or went back,
B:	but the rest of them now have their American citizenship and are leading productive lives,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, you
A:	Well, the the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle things, the cholera,  and hepatitis epidemics now in, in Latin America.
B:	Yes.
A:	And it shows the, the unpreparedness for such, such a problem.
B:	Yes.
A:	And yet they're so,
B:	Oh, the stories she tells, you know, are just unnerving just unnerving.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And they're, they're so rich in resources there.
A:	They're very rich in oil and gas.
A:	And they're very rich in gold and silver, and very rich in, in, uh, natural resources such as the fish and, uh timber, and, and copper and all types of, uh, resources
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but they,
B:	And the uranium.
A:	Yes,
A:	and,
A:	but they don't have,
A:	it's sort of like Russia,
A:	they don't have the ability to develop it.
B:	The technology.
A:	Right.
A:	And they, they're very,
B:	Well,
B:	and, you know, they're very willing to be taught in many cases now, too,
B:	but, you know, there's just always this kind of resentment underlying
B:	I think that when they receive help from us, they want it,
B:	but, they don't want it, I mean
A:	You're you're exactly right.
B:	It's kind of a catch twenty-two.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	It, it's sort of illustrated by the, uh, World Bank and International Monetary Fund not wanting to continue to do business there
A:	because they offer assistance, then don't get repaid.
B:	Yeah,
B:	yeah.
A:	So it's sort of a thumbing of the nose, uh, approach.
A:	They need it,
A:	and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations,
A:	but uh, then don't.
A:	Of course it's a very volatile government, uh, situation, too.
B:	Well,
B:	and I think that, you know, it,
B:	somewhat a sarcastic view,
B:	but some of those drugs czars, you know,
B:	they, they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that's the way to bring us to our knees, more on their level.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know,
B:	You know, that's really, uh, kind of a far fetched idea,
B:	I know,
B:	and I don't think people probably think those things consciously,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's like in any sibling rivalry
A:	Well the,
B:	we're hearing the same,
A:	The solution discussed at one time and I think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the the U S government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to, to beef up the military and to do all other things.
A:	I think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it,
A:	which would still give the, uh, the grower in Columbia and elsewhere in Latin America the, uh, the money that they apparently need and go, go to the illegal crop for.
A:	And it would save the U S money in in the long run in how much they're trying to do,
B:	In the long run.
B:	And in the short run probably too.
A:	True.
B:	Course, then could, you know, at, at some point, could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind.
A:	No,
A:	no.
B:	You know.
A:	And, I, I think finding an alternate to that would be very good.
B:	I mean even their, even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view, coffee tobacco you know
A:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Argentine beef,
A:	yeah,
A:	yeah.
B:	They're certainly legal,
B:	but they're certainly not healthy.
A:	Well, have we come up with a solution yet, Salina?
B:	No,
B:	not that I know of
B:	But it's been fun hashing about it I suppose.
B:	At any rate,
B:	yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	Well, one of these days, uh, I hope we'll find some, some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones.
B:	Well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and I do here tonight
B:	but,
A:	I agree.
B:	Well, it's been nice chatting with you.
A:	Yes,
A:	it has.
B:	I appreciate it,
B:	and, and tell your wife I hope we, I get her again sometime, too.
B:	This is fun,
A:	Very good
B:	It's kind of nice to, to see old friends now, you see.
A:	All right,
A:	thank you Salina.
B:	Bye now.
A:	Bye.
B:	Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.
A:	Yes
B:	And, uh, the, the interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free
B:	I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.
B:	I, I don't mind regulating all of the, the guns
B:	and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.
B:	Now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.
B:	Uh, the method of, of controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls.
B:	Uh, one point that was made in the House hearings
B:	or
B:	the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,
B:	but, uh, we don't want to check his background,
B:	and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes
A:	Right.
B:	uh,
B:	but there still, the, the technology exists to, to check it if they want.
B:	So, it's, it's kind of a,
B:	I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.
B:	And then you've got the group of people that decide that there's, there's no particular reason to have them at all
B:	and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
B:	and I guess I would fall more in the, the realm that I like the sport issue of it,
B:	but I, I could give it up without too much trouble,
B:	not the world's most pleasurable thing
B:	and it costs a bit to do it, uh, finding ranges and things like that.
A:	Yes
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,
B:	but it's just not like golf or whatever.
B:	I mean there are other things that you could go do.
B:	So, uh, I, I don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving factor.
B:	I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't even keep the gun in our house,
A:	Right.
B:	so I don't have that problem,
B:	but, uh,
B:	it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.
B:	A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it.
A:	They do,
A:	and you, boy you can get them on either side
A:	and just like you say,
A:	uh, well I think I, I guess I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight
A:	because,
A:	or not,
A:	onto no control,
A:	I'm sorry, excuse me, that,
A:	uh, two or three.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was going the wrong direction.
A:	Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
A:	and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,
A:	but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,
A:	uh, he knew where booth, both places were, loaded the gun
A:	and they were playing cowboys and Indians
A:	and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes.
A:	So, uh,
A:	I mean it,
A:	it destroyed two families uh, in just that instant
B:	Right.
A:	and, and I, a lot of people say that they need it for protection, uh,
A:	having worked at one time in Baltimore,
A:	or,
A:	I don't know if you're in the big city,
B:	Dallas.
A:	are you,
A:	Dallas?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's a big city
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, then you know that, uh, uh,
A:	if you live anywhere real close that, uh,
A:	the safety is, uh,
A:	some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.
A:	But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up.
A:	Uh, I, uh,
A:	once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman
A:	and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,
A:	and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, so, you know, if he's got one.
A:	Uh, and if not,
A:	uh, then usually they, uh,
A:	if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,
A:	I mean, you know they, they,
B:	Right.
A:	he said that it, it was better not to have,
A:	especially myself, now I'm a widow,
A:	and, uh,
A:	I, so I'm, when my handicapped son is, is not at home, I'm by myself,
A:	but, uh, there's,
A:	I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really uh, playing Russian Roulette if you do
A:	Uh,
B:	Yeah.
B:	About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way.
B:	Once you're surprised, it's too late.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, and the rare,
A:	That's right.
B:	you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,
A:	Right.
B:	and had time to do anything about it.
A:	That's right.
B:	And, I don't have that problem,
B:	as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one.
B:	In the, uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,
B:	it's hard to know the original intent,
B:	but I, I don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public.
A:	Right.
B:	And you have a, you have a earn a right,
B:	not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,
B:	then you have a right to have that arm,
B:	but, uh,
A:	That's right.
B:	you know, there's all sorts of arguments there
A:	I know
B:	but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,
A:	No.
B:	they didn't have this problem back then
A:	No,
A:	that's true.
A:	That, That's, that's right,
B:	So, we change our rights with our social status.
A:	that's right.
B:	They're man given rights
B:	and they can be taken away by a man,
B:	so,
A:	Right.
B:	uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.
B:	They can go live in another country if they want.
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	that's how I feel, too.
A:	I know, well,
A:	even here where I work, uh, we have a, a gun club.
A:	And, of course, those people are very avid.
A:	They, you know, they say there should be no ban,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that it's not,
A:	but I can't see why any, uh, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,
A:	but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,
A:	or, I mean,
A:	I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either
B:	Right.
A:	So, uh, I, I think they should have at least some control over, over those things.
A:	Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,
A:	well, I, I understand about the privacy act and everything,
A:	but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not.
A:	That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.
B:	Right.
A:	And if they do,
A:	course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway.
B:	Right.
A:	And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them.
A:	Course, some of them do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So it, it is a hard question
B:	Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.
B:	Most regulation does
A:	Right,
A:	oh, yeah.
B:	and, most,
B:	it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever you want, however you want to word it
A:	That's right.
B:	so it's,
B:	well, this may be a never ending topic.
B:	I got a couple of calls waiting on me,
B:	so I'd better let you go.
A:	Okay,
A:	well thanks for talking.
B:	Okay, bye.
A:	Bye-bye now.
A:	Uh, our children are both, uh, basically adults.
A:	They, we've, we've got two.
A:	Uh, one is twenty-one,
A:	and one is twenty-five.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they, they still live at home.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's, that's a little unusual for, uh, for children of that age, to have both of them that age at home.
A:	But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.
A:	Actually the, they're both going on their own most of the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, most of our activities are, you know, just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing.
B:	Uh-huh
B:	Well, we have a, uh, three year old and a one year old.
B:	And, uh, so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know.
A:	Sure it does.
B:	And, uh, most of the time with a three year old we're trying to, to get him, uh,
B:	well, we play usually in the evening when, when I get home, you know, about five o'clock or so until about eight, you know, with the exception of dinner.
B:	Out in the front or backyard playing like, uh, tee ball off the, you know, off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball.
B:	Uh, since we just got here we got the, uh, uh, new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him,
B:	and he really likes riding that around.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I,
B:	So, you know,
B:	and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and, uh, playing squirt guns and all that,
B:	he really likes that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything,
B:	trying to do everything he does.
A:	Yeah,
A:	is the one year old a boy?
B:	No,
B:	it's a girl.
A:	A girl?
B:	Yeah.
A:	ours, uh, the older one is a girl,
A:	so.
A:	And the, and the younger one is a boy,
A:	so.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for children, uh,
A:	I don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is,
A:	but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I think, uh, the big city, uh,
A:	activities for, for children now are,
A:	they're good
A:	but there's so much, uh, potential danger, you know,
A:	that you really have to watch your children so closely now
A:	that, you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I'm from a smaller town in east Texas.
A:	And I could, you know, go and do whatever, pretty much whatever I wanted to do, uh, my whole life.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, you know, I never, never had to worry about the bad guys being out there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, you know, I find it's, it's quite a bit different now
A:	that, uh, you know, you have to watch your children so closely and, uh, keep up with them.
A:	I, I feel like, uh,
A:	that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.
B:	Well, I, I agree with that,
B:	and I seem, I seem to feel the same way, you know,
B:	even just when I grew up and everything.
B:	And, and, the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is, is at hand and everything.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with
B:	and, and the looking, you know,
B:	just start not even,
B:	not really looking for a school for him but, uh, like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	For, for a three year old it's that, uh,
B:	there's a lot of emphasis on, on, on, on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten.
A:	Right.
B:	And, and it seems like it's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in kindergarten.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And it seems like it's more, uh,
B:	you know, I don't know.
B:	They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know,
B:	kids just because of the computer age or whatever, it just, know more when they get, you know, to be five or six or something.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But,
A:	Um, I guess looking at, uh, back at, at what our children did compared to what, uh, you know, what I had to go through in school.
A:	The, uh, there there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum.
A:	It's a lot more complicated.
A:	A lot more available, of course.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, this,
A:	so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.
A:	I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, you know, just,
A:	or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	One thing is I got a home computer too
B:	and, uh, I play, uh, with the three year old
B:	I play some computer games and stuff with him.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Educational games like, you know, concentration type games, the matching, things like that.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, he's, he really likes it
B:	and, uh, and I think it's important because I think that, uh, you know, it gives him the interaction with the computer
B:	because it sure looks like that's going to be you know, the big thing for a long time.
A:	Huh,
B:	And given, given that knowledge and stuff with it
A:	yeah,
A:	I think, uh,
B:	and he seems to enjoy it.
A:	ery faint Oh.
B:	And, uh, of course, the one year old hasn't, hasn't gotten there yet
B:	but, uh,
B:	and the other thing we try to do is, uh, since the here is, uh, sign him up for, and her, for, uh, different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming,
A:	Right.
B:	you know, uh,
B:	or,
B:	there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so
B:	and, uh, you know,
B:	where they go for an hour or so.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh,
B:	because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too
B:	and he really liked it
B:	so we're going to do that with our daughter too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more fun.
A:	I can't imagine them having as much fun as the parents, had watching them
B:	I know.
B:	Well, we were just talking about that too.
B:	And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while, see what happens
A:	Right,
A:	yeah
A:	The, the disorganized play really what it was,
A:	but, but, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah,
A:	when ours was a,
A:	he,
A:	I guess he was probably five or six, you know, when he first started playing soccer.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh,
A:	and it's,
A:	I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids play,
A:	so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education, uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly in this area, the systems are not under enough control.
A:	The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Excuse me.
A:	Um, and the, and that's kind of contradictory to what I said
A:	but, you know, you,
A:	the,
A:	you have to be under control so much when they're out
A:	but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control, over them as, uh, as what I would liked to have seen.
B:	Right,
B:	right.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you know, to not concentrate as much on the education.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, they're, they're there for a good time.
B:	Right.
A:	And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I know of number of people that are in the, in the, uh, school district down in, in, uh, San Antonio.
B:	And, uh, it seems like it's,
B:	a lot of the problem is to, you know,
B:	you always have the lack of funds
B:	but it seems to be getting worse and worse
B:	and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as, as, as, kids need.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, you know, that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to, that's going to come out or anything.
A:	But, uh,
B:	But,
A:	ery faint Yeah.
A:	But, uh, I, I don't, I don't know
A:	I think, uh, you know, some of the thing has to do with, uh, with the civil rights program.
A:	Not that the civil rights program is bad
A:	but that there's,
A:	it carried over, into, you know, individual rights
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it, you know, trickled
A:	Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity,
A:	and I had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working,
A:	uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column
B:	Yeah.
A:	and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely,
A:	which is even worse than them just not getting bright
B:	Exactly.
A:	And I had presumed that it was the switch,
A:	and, uh, this is, uh, an older car,
A:	it's a seventy-two M G,
A:	so I had to mail order the part, uh,
A:	which I had done,
A:	and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to discover that that apparently is not the problem,
A:	it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that, uh, you know, that they will accept it,
A:	although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used.
B:	Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?
A:	Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I talked to one mechanic about it,
A:	and he suspected the switch also.
A:	Uh, but I've not, you know,
A:	I really don't know what the problem might be.
A:	It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,
A:	but,
B:	Yeah, I know,
B:	uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.
B:	Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam?
A:	I I don't know,
A:	I should look at that.
A:	I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram
B:	Diagram.
A:	so I'll have to go back and look at that.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.
B:	I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,
B:	but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse.
A:	Yeah,
A:	that's a good idea.
B:	So, that's a possibility.
A:	What I've typically found when that, uh,
A:	companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,
A:	and I hope that that's the case this time.
B:	Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports?
A:	Right,
A:	exactly
B:	Who,
A:	it's out of Kansas somewhere.
B:	Um
B:	so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that.
A:	No,
A:	it's not.
A:	I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car,
A:	but it is not either,
A:	it's obviously doesn't quite fit,
A:	so it must be for a different year,
A:	so I'll have to try to return that as well.
B:	Yeah,
B:	have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the metroplex?
A:	Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car,
A:	because I've owned this car since it was new,
A:	and, uh,
A:	but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I hadn't used him for some years,
A:	and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized
A:	instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and ause German cars
B:	I'll be darned.
A:	I'm not sure that he works on much else at all,
A:	but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.
A:	So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person,
A:	as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.
A:	So, I'll, uh, I should be able to take it in and check that part out.
A:	I've not had to exchange any other parts recently, because they were defective.
A:	Now, I've had, had pretty good luck,
A:	I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I purchased it at Sam's,
A:	and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty,
A:	and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,
A:	because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole year go by.
A:	Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play,
A:	and as it turned out, it had a full year's warranty,
A:	and I could have gotten it repaired for free
A:	but I had to take it in,
B:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost,
A:	uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	So I didn't even, I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.
A:	But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.
B:	Well, ours wasn't within the last year.
B:	I guess it's been within the last two years, uh,
B:	Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new,
B:	and it's one with the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh,
B:	I don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort,
B:	and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two problems.
B:	It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point that we park on a hill, under our car port,
B:	and, it, when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley,
B:	and knowing that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard,
B:	otherwise it would just wrench control away from you.
A:	Good grief.
B:	And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the engine would just quit.
B:	So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out,
B:	and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing,
B:	so they adjusted timing
B:	and the problem didn't go away,
B:	so we ended up taking it back again,
B:	and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around,
B:	but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever,
B:	and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the, uh, computer control unit,
A:	Huh.
B:	which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part
A:	My goodness.
B:	and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time,
A:	Huh.
B:	and now it seems to be,
B:	we we're not experiencing the stalling,
B:	but we're still experiencing a very uneven,
A:	Okay.
A:	What do you think about it?
B:	Uh, well, immigration,
B:	I know they're really strict right now because my husband is from out of the country
B:	and, uh, we had to go through a whole, very long process to, uh, to, assure the government that he was, uh, marrying me and not to be a resident here.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's
A:	yeah,
A:	I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.
A:	I worked with Spanish people for about two years
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's true.
B:	I mean, you can't just come over to the country because, uh, you want to.
A:	Right.
B:	You know, that's not good enough.
B:	You have to have a, have to have a darn good reason of, political or whatever.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly.
B:	Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.
B:	Exactly.
B:	My mother, uh, actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men just,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	she'd never even meet them
B:	and she'd just get money for it.
A:	Oh, you're kidding.
B:	Huh-uh.
B:	So,
A:	Sounds like a lot of fun.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.
B:	Exactly.
B:	But, I mean, with the new laws, it's it's tough now.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah,
A:	it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.
B:	Exactly.
A:	You know, I think,
B:	Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they got here,
B:	but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you can't just do that.
A:	Right,
A:	exactly.
A:	And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow a good number of people in every year
A:	because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.
B:	I agree.
A:	And I just,
A:	I don't know,
A:	I have, personally I have a problem with it,
A:	I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't close our door.
B:	Exactly.
B:	If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.
B:	They're going to be a productive citizen Zen.
A:	And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in
A:	and,
B:	Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and that's, that's what I think.
A:	You know, I, I have to laugh
A:	because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those
A:	and they'd been deported two or three times
A:	and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas. Or for any other time.
B:	That's right,
B:	that's our money.
B:	Yes,
B:	that's true.
A:	But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.
A:	I think the general idea is good
A:	but, but there could be some work done in the area.
B:	I, I think
B:	I, I agree.
A:	Well good
A:	Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh that you might want to talk about?
B:	Uh, I, uh,
B:	boy
B:	this is spur of the moment, uh,
B:	but, I, I don't really see any, any changes that I think of really blatant right now
B:	other than I think they ought to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh, political refugee.
A:	Yeah,
A:	absolutely.
A:	I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who we want to
A:	because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.
B:	Exactly.
B:	Connections and money.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know. And that it should be equal to all
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then not like the United States,
A:	basically, it's not who you know,
A:	it it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.
B:	I agree.
A:	And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in
B:	Yeah
B:	Well, we got him past that,
B:	but, uh,
A:	Well, great.
B:	I know there's a lot of other people out there, would probably do a good job here.
A:	Yep.
A:	Well, let's see,
A:	is there anything I believe in
B:	I think that's it.
B:	Is this like a very short call?
A:	No,
A:	I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be,
A:	but, I've enjoyed it.
A:	It's good hearing your, your point of view
A:	and I think that's neat.
A:	I think we agree a lot on that
A:	and I've learned something from it.
B:	I did, too.
B:	Well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	Well, thanks,
A:	I'm glad you're home.
A:	You have a good evening, all right?
B:	You, too.
A:	Thanks,
A:	bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
A:	Well, seems to me the, one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process.
B:	Well, I agree with the boredom of the election process,
B:	but I also, uh, think that people don't realize that their boat, vote will make a difference.
B:	Uh, they feel like that, you know, it's going to go however it's going to go
B:	and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
B:	and it's, just why make the effort.
A:	Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.
B:	Well, I agree with that
B:	and I, and I do know that, you know, all those votes are counted
B:	and, and they do make a difference.
B:	Uh, also I think that people have a tendency to, to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the, the more local elections.
A:	Well, it's kind of strange
A:	because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives.
B:	Exactly,
B:	and, I, I even have a tendency to do that myself.
B:	And I have to really make a concerted effort to, to get involved.
B:	I live, I live in a suburb in Mesquite
B:	and, uh, so I really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me.
B:	But I, I think on the whole, most people don't, uh, feel that way.
B:	Or don't look, even look at that.
B:	I think they just don't even,
B:	I, I don't think they're conscious of it.
A:	Well, maybe part of the problem is they don't, they think they have enough choices.
B:	Well, that may be true, too.
B:	I hadn't thought of that.
A:	You know, in some of the European countries, they have numbers of parties that run
A:	and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	right.
B:	And sometimes it's, uh,
B:	well, not sometimes, but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign
B:	and, and issues get, uh, bogged down.
A:	Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.
B:	Uh, I think voter awareness,
B:	I, I did some work for the, uh, Women's League of, uh, Voters, uh, several years ago
B:	and, I think there are some organizations that used to, uh, do some voter awareness, uh, things.
B:	They don't get a lot of participation.
B:	They don't get a lot of, uh, activity.
B:	Most of the League of Women Voters, what they did was they put out information, so that it, it would just be made available to everyone.
B:	Now, other areas that I've worked in, like in the chambers, they would just have the candidates come
B:	and it would just, you know,
B:	that was not a lot of community involvement
B:	and those were people that would mostly vote anyway.
A:	Well, I think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long.
A:	In Britain, you know, they have a set period of time
A:	and, and for campaign, that's it.
A:	In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.
B:	It's a, it's an ongoing campaign
B:	and it's expensive campaign
B:	and it, it, uh, eliminates a lot of qualified people.
B:	Uh, maybe more qualified and, uh, more dedicated to the issues.
A:	Well, the, they don't want to spend the time
A:	or they don't have the money.
B:	Exactly,
B:	exactly
B:	and it, it,
B:	I, I can't I just can't believe,
B:	I've, I've worked in a couple of local campaigns.
B:	I just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally.
A:	Well, it's a matter of name recognition.
A:	People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.
B:	Oh, well, I agree with that,
B:	but also,
B:	and I, and I'm not for controlling how much is spent,
B:	but do you know,
B:	that's one thing,
B:	if a, if the time wasn't so,
B:	if it wasn't such a long, uh, campaigning time, then they couldn't spend as much money.
A:	And even debates don't seem to help much.
B:	No,
B:	they really don't.
B:	Uh, it's it's, a lot of it is who looks the best, who, uh, who happens to say the right thing at the right time, who, not, who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh, the job done.
A:	So we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers.
B:	Exactly.
B:	And it's a, it's a lot,
B:	I've worked in public relations a lot
B:	and, uh, that kind of thing can make and break, make or break you
A:	Well, that was certainly a media event.
B:	and it's just, uh, uh,
B:	he possibly could have, uh, won that election had it not been for some of the the, uh, the way he presented himself.
A:	Well, he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease.
B:	Hoof, is, is, I guess the right term for him.
A:	Night,
B:	Fine,
B:	thank you.
A:	I understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight.
B:	Yes.
A:	I hope you know more about it than I do.
B:	Oh, well I just got through renting, reading, uh, SPACE by, uh, James Michener.
A:	Oh, is that right?
B:	And so that, uh, helped out a little bit I think.
A:	I haven't read his book.
A:	I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.
B:	Well, he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes.
A:	Well,
A:	and I don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in TEXAS
A:	so I wasn't sure how credible he was.
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	But anyway, what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights?
B:	Well uh, I'm not sure to be honest with you,
B:	so, uh, this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
B:	and, uh, And, yeah,
A:	Ego trip.
B:	it was nice to go there,
B:	but I don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I happen to live not too far away from,
B:	uh, well, I've actually worked for the company that, uh, has been blamed for the Challenger disaster. Uh Morton Thiakol.
A:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, that's been kind of a, a real negative feeling here
B:	is
A:	Right.
B:	sure it was, you know, very unfortunate thing that occurred there
B:	and it's,
A:	Where do you live?
B:	Uh, we live in, uh, Utah.
A:	You live in
A:	am I talking to Utah right now?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, oh, great.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because I'm in Dallas.
B:	Uh,
B:	Oh.
B:	I have a sister that lives in Dallas,
B:	that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for Penney's there.
A:	I see.
A:	I see.
B:	So.
A:	Carolyn Rash?
B:	Pardon me?
A:	Is her name Rash, Carolyn Rash?
B:	No, her name is, uh, my last name is Skidmore.
A:	I see.
B:	And her, her husband's name is, his last name is Weight.
A:	I see.
B:	And, uh,
A:	Well, you probably know a lot about it.
A:	I wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company.
A:	I hadn't heard that.
B:	Well, they were.
B:	There was, uh,
B:	apparently the specifications for the joints, uh,
B:	they were not to perform in, uh, cold weather
B:	and, uh, apparently there was definitely a, a joint that did not seal,
B:	and, uh, if you've ever seen the size of those, uh, motors that put them into space,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, and there is a lot of pressure, lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So it's, this book was interesting, though.
B:	I, uh,
B:	talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come, overcome to, uh,
B:	it's a very complex, uh, situation to go into space.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	I would think so, too
B:	They would,
B:	the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how, how much of a problem it is to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.
A:	You never think about that do you?
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down.
B:	Yeah
B:	But they have to come in at a, just the right angle.
B:	If you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up.
A:	Right.
B:	So,
A:	Well, I saw one of, some of those early space capsules at Smithsonian.
A:	I'm sure you've seen more of them than I have,
B:	Oh.
A:	but you could see the scorch on them, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	they had though piles
B:	Yeah.
A:	but you could see where they would come off in the, how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I've, I've, I would say I've never, I've never seen an actual capsule.
A:	Well, I,
A:	excuse me, go ahead.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I've seen more, more of the motors that, that they produced out there.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, these were the ones that John Glenn went up in you know, and the old, old ones.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The very first ones,
A:	the little bell type things.
B:	People have commented how, uh, they were surprised at how small they were.
A:	Yeah,
A:	they really were,
A:	they just, uh,
B:	Looked pretty confining, huh.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	and, uh, the whole thing was small
A:	and, yeah, you, I mean, you actually put it on you know.
B:	Is that right?
A:	You put it around you pretty much,
A:	it was so small.
B:	Huh.
A:	Well, I thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space,
A:	but did he go into that in the book?
B:	Not really. Uh,
A:	I guess that's just to sell us on it.
B:	One thing's,
B:	I know one thing they've, they've mentioned that I didn't get from the book, by the way,
B:	but, it talked about, uh,
B:	they're able to manufacture, uh, different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost, uh, nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's perfectly round.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity.
A:	Well, that's true
A:	and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's right
A:	Well, do you think we should continue to support it at the level,
A:	well, I thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying.
A:	Because I think those satellites, you know, or not satellites, but the spaceflights could really spy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and with, uh with Russia's demise, I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level.
B:	Yes.
B:	Uh, I think they have cut it back, to be honest with you. From, from the glory days when they did the Apollo shots to the moon.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh.
B:	Uh, I appreciate having the satellites.
B:	You know, that's certainly made it nice for other purpose.
B:	I don't know if you have a satellite dish or not.
B:	We don't
A:	No,
A:	I don't.
A:	I don't either.
B:	but I I know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard. Uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, go ahead.
B:	What are we supposed to discuss again?
A:	AIDS research is something that, that, I think whether our country is putting enough money into it
B:	More money )),
A:	and actually I'm concerned that they're not.
A:	I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And these were from other, people from other countries.
A:	He's a translator.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in talking to the people from France he said, you know,
A:	he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is.
A:	And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
B:	Huh.
A:	Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.
A:	So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.
A:	I don't know that spending more always gets it.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary.
B:	I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases,
B:	and, uh, I mean whether,
A:	You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
B:	Yes.
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, whether those diseases can
B:	some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	didn't, uh, you know,
B:	but I, uh,
B:	then part of it's lack of education.
B:	I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
A:	Well it,
A:	I, I agree with you there
A:	because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one
A:	and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly,
A:	or do they both get served?
A:	Uh, that's a good point.
B:	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.
B:	One is preventing the spread
B:	and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm not certain,
B:	I, I,
B:	again this,
B:	I'm telling you,
B:	basically I don't have any opinion.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
A:	Well, and one of the things I'd,
A:	and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, you know,
A:	That's, that's the part that,
B:	t-, whether my dentist or
A:	That's the part that scares me, you know.
A:	I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals,
A:	well no,
A:	it's for homosexuals and gays,
A:	well no,
A:	actually, it's,
A:	I mean, you know.
A:	Did they know that all along?
B:	and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes.
B:	And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.
B:	Can't get it from mosquitoes.
B:	And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions,
B:	yes.
A:	Oh
B:	And I don't know that's true or not.
B:	I mean, I just heard it in passing,
B:	but so what does that,
A:	Right.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
A:	And how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Which is, I think, what they also don't know.
A:	I mean that's,
A:	I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,
A:	but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
B:	No.
A:	In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,
A:	and it's huge over there.
A:	So I, I, you know,
A:	and it's beginning, other countries
A:	that's what's his point.
A:	This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?
B:	Oh.
A:	I mean I don't know.
A:	All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.
A:	Uh, or maybe they understand but,
B:	I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, and then the people that have it,
A:	it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.
A:	If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
B:	I, I, give me cyanide.
B:	I mean, is it )),
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
A:	I'll take anything you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.
B:	Ri-,
B:	Exactly.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
A:	Exactly.
B:	let them, do it.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
A:	And that's what I think they're saying too.
B:	Have you had any snow up your way?
A:	No,
A:	we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas
A:	and, uh we had a lot before Christmas.
B:	Um.
A:	The ski resorts were really
A:	and, uh,
A:	but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,
A:	so,
A:	but no, uh, no snow.
B:	Um.
A:	The snows all melted off uh,
B:	Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend
B:	and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.
A:	Uh-huh,
A:	I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,
A:	but not,
A:	usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
A:	and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches.
B:	Um
A:	At this time of the year,
A:	and we've been in a drought for the last five years
A:	and this is the sixth year
A:	and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas.
A:	Right.
B:	But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,
B:	but we have our share of cold weather as well.
B:	The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.
B:	It didn't stay there,
B:	but it was right at,
A:	Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?
A:	Um.
B:	We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,
B:	but this year it wasn't bad at all.
B:	I guess that's because we had so much rain.
A:	I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
A:	He said it was just,
A:	and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston
B:	and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,
B:	and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course.
A:	Oh, boy.
B:	They have a, uh, lake cabin
B:	and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake.
A:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	So we really had a lot of rain.
A:	Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,
A:	there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,
A:	and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,
A:	but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.
A:	It just
B:	Yeah,
B:	we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
B:	We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Not more than ten
B:	but,
A:	That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.
B:	Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,
B:	it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, it's, uh, interesting,
A:	uh,
A:	I'm going down to El Paso next week
A:	and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,
A:	but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,
B:	Well, El Paso won't be cold.
A:	It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?
B:	No,
B:	it's, it's, quite southern
B:	and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The, uh, you'll be flying in there?
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,
B:	the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies
A:	Yes.
B:	and they're towering above you
B:	and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.
A:	Yeah,
A:	we're kind of used to that here in Utah,
A:	course, there are mountains,
A:	and I fly into Montana a lot
A:	and we have a,
A:	the mountains are, are really, uh, high
A:	and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,
A:	it's in the little valley,
A:	but, I, uh, sure hope we,
A:	we really need the moisture.
A:	I hope we can get, uh, get some.
A:	There's supposed to be a storm,
A:	but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah
A:	and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here
A:	so,
B:	Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,
B:	but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, that's, that's what the,
A:	above, uh,
A:	some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,
A:	so that just left us,
A:	we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the
B:	Huh.
A:	and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know
B:	Oh, boy.
A:	airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day
A:	and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Huh.
B:	Well, we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago.
B:	We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,
A:	Well, the topic's about government.
A:	Uh, I'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic. Uh,
B:	I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh, how many people are self serving.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, you I, I think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt And that people aren't self serving.
A:	Uh-huh
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean that's what I would like to think.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I, I, I think that the last, uh, part of that question was particularly interesting, uh, about, uh, uh, uh, can all unethical behavior, or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh, because it seems to me that when uh, government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh, parallel to the legal codes that, uh, we're focusing on the wrong thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	yeah.
A:	Maybe, maybe that's what is happening.
A:	Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past, you know, ten to twenty years that, uh, it becomes more evident.
A:	Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or, you know, et cetera like that
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I couldn't help thinking when that last it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we, uh, actually put a legal code on that, uh, how much, uh, should it be our, uh, prerogative to see into the private lives of these people. You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that makes sense.
A:	Um.
B:	Because you start prying in people's private lives, you ruin their lives as well as,
A:	That's right.
B:	And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, sometimes, I don't know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.
B:	I mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician.
A:	I, I, I agree with that and, uh, and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then, uh, then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's it.
A:	And, uh you when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	The, that's, that's the thing that,
A:	uh, things that you don't know uh, do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	People could say, oh, they do it,
A:	so, I guess, you know,
A:	but, as soon as things do get public uh, there, there is that terrible concern.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um
A:	So, sometimes I ask myself, what are, uh, people doing that are in the media when somebody, you know, comes up to office,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah
B:	I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know.
A:	It's a very low way of living.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, so,
A:	and, and, and as far as, uh, you know, myself having any particular personal, uh, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, it, I'm not terribly involved in it.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Just in a very cursory way.
B:	Right.
A:	I vote
A:	and I, you know, try to do whatever I can on the little local area,
A:	but, I, I, it just is not one of the things that I have, uh, placed, uh, uh, a, a lot of my particular time and effort into,
B:	Yeah.
A:	so, I, I always feel very outside this kind of, uh, this kind of an issue.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I am kind of the same way.
B:	I just kind of read the paper follow up on I mean, you know, just keep an eye on what's going on
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah,
A:	right.
B:	but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
A:	Yeah,
A:	uh,
A:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	I'm not, I'm not in there,
A:	I'm not one of those, uh, you know, volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever, uh, although I admire the people that do that
A:	and they certainly do get inside information
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight.
B:	Right.
B:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But the media insight, as you said,
A:	I just kind of read and kind of be aware
B:	Yeah.
A:	and then, uh, I don't like to make a whole lot of, uh, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay.
B:	All right.
B:	That's a real different topic.
B:	I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy.
A:	I know.
A:	I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about.
A:	See, I'm a college student,
A:	so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.
B:	Yeah.
B:	I think, personally, you know,
B:	I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, golly.
A:	You're like, No, you don't, no.
B:	It's like, how do you know my name,
B:	where did you get my phone number,
B:	and why do you think it's a deal for me?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit
A:	Yeah.
B:	and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.
A:	They call late,
A:	now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or
B:	Oh, they do already.
A:	See, that's
A:	I would be so mad
B:	Well,
B:	and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too.
A:	Really.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
A:	How?
B:	Don't answer your phone, Hello.
B:	The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello.
A:	Really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
A:	I don't know,
A:	I think like things that, that
A:	I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That drives me up a wall.
B:	Are you and your roommate a similar size.
A:	No,
A:	see, we're not,
A:	and, uh.
B:	And she still goes through your clothes?
A:	Yeah,
A:	she'll take all my shirts and stuff,
A:	because she can't wear like my pants
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
B:	Ooh.
A:	Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	But still, she'll just take them,
A:	and she won't even think about it,
A:	and then, I'll like see her that day,
A:	and she'll be wearing my clothes,
A:	and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,
A:	I really don't.
A:	So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	because she doesn't even ask me.
A:	Stuff like that really
A:	like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	I agree.
A:	Stuff like that,
A:	when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was thinking like my mom.
A:	I know this,
A:	she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	we always just give her her purse, you know,
A:	and she'll get it out or whatever.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I was trying to think,
A:	I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
B:	My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
A:	Really.
B:	I mean, we're all grown,
B:	all her kids are grown,
B:	and we have our own families
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?
A:	Yeah,
A:	get out of my cabinets.
B:	Like, what are you doing?
B:	Don't you have your own house to dig through?
A:	That's great.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so, I guess, privacy is really,
B:	and at the work place, I suppose,
B:	oh, well, actually yes.
B:	I can say definitely, privacy at the work place.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
A:	See.
A:	Yeah.
B:	because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,
B:	and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way.
A:	You could tell,
A:	you know you put your stuff where it's,
A:	Yeah.
A:	That would drive, that would, that
B:	It would drive, it drove me batty for a while.
A:	Really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, I worked a second shift
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and everybody else in my area worked first shift
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and our shifts overlapped
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I would come in,
B:	and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,
B:	and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,
B:	it's my vitamins,
B:	I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,
B:	why are they working at my desk,
B:	and can I have it back.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Can I have it back soon, maybe.
A:	Then you start missing stuff,
A:	and.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	no mommy is going to take the vitamins,
B:	I'm sorry,
B:	I have
A:	That's okay.
A:	See that would, that would make me really mad,
A:	because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,
A:	just because,
A:	I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way
A:	and you know how it looks and everything.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, you know how you left it the day before.
A:	Uh-huh. child_talking
A:	That would bother me, definitely.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	so, that's, child_talking
B:	yeah,
B:	I agree,
B:	it's, it's pretty tough that way,
B:	and, I know, even like with your school books and papers.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do you miss your papers sometimes?
A:	See,
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know.
A:	That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well, actually I do know,
B:	and I have used it once
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,
B:	but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And that,
B:	I mean, I've, I've used it once,
B:	All right,
B:	well do you play any musical instruments or,
A:	No,
A:	I don't play any.
A:	I used to.
B:	Oh well,
A:	I think everybody took piano lessons
A:	so,
B:	Everybody,
B:	sure.
B:	I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,
B:	and I've, I still play the piano as of today.
A:	Do you?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	I started,
A:	I think I was in the fifth grade
A:	and I played it for maybe three months
B:	But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band.
B:	I played the drums,
B:	I played the clarinet,
B:	I played the trumpet.
A:	Wow
B:	Uh, you know, whatever
B:	and so I, I still sing,
B:	and I sing in the choir today
B:	so,
A:	All right
B:	I I enjoy the music,
B:	it gives me an out.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It always sounds like,
B:	for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know.
A:	True
B:	So, how long did you play?
A:	Only for about three months.
B:	Three months.
A:	Yeah,
A:	me and my brother both took the classes
A:	and we got pretty bored quick
B:	I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh.
A:	Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song.
B:	Oh, the wood chuck song
A:	And I still can to this date.
B:	And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yep,
A:	they went out and bought us a piano
A:	and for three months
B:	Oh, bless your heart.
B:	Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all.
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	any time I got bored
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?
A:	No.
B:	No.
A:	And Jaws,
A:	but I think everybody can.
B:	Okay.
B:	I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky
B:	because I,
B:	if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,
B:	but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so
A:	Yeah.
B:	I played uh, concertos and other stuff
B:	but,
B:	I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,
B:	so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,
B:	but anyway,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I enjoy it, though.
B:	I find it to be a good out
B:	and I still enjoy the marching band
B:	and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir
B:	so,
A:	Do you sing at choir at your church?
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes,
B:	I do.
B:	That's,
B:	in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade
A:	and they wouldn't let me in.
A:	So, I never tried again.
B:	Well, I sing in the choir,
B:	I do know if they want me to or not,
B:	but at least I do sing in it
A:	Yeah,
B:	That's pretty good.
B:	Well,
A:	I never really learned the music or anything.
A:	I never learned,
A:	I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
A:	and that's about when I quit.
B:	I was at,
B:	I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician.
B:	I wanted to be a high school band director.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But after one semester of that, I said no, no,
B:	this isn't for me.
B:	enjoy it, but not for profession, no.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
B:	I gave up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Course, my mom thought I was,
B:	but, uh, you know,
A:	Of course,
A:	parents always do.
B:	Oh, yeah,
B:	so,
A:	They're nice that way.
B:	Yes.
B:	Well, what else can we uh, talk about,
B:	uh,
A:	Uh, well, I don't,
A:	so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?
B:	No,
B:	no,
B:	I, I listen to K V I L.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So I listen to the radio,
B:	I like the pop music.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,
B:	but that's who I go for
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	the jeezer music as I call it.
B:	Oh, the jeezer music.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay,
B:	well,
A:	My boss listens to that.
A:	We listen to ninety-seven point nine
A:	and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music.
B:	Okay,
B:	now what kind of music do you listen to?
A:	Well, I listen to like ninety-seven point one, you know, more,
B:	What what is that?
A:	It's more, uh,
A:	I don't know how to explain it,
A:	kind of pop, you know, rock.
B:	Rock.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Hard rock?
A:	Well, not hard
B:	Not hard rock.
A:	Just kind of,
B:	Not like the eagle.
A:	Huh?
B:	Is that the eagle?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Okay,
B:	I know, I know what the eagle is.
A:	It's not too hard,
A:	it's,
B:	That's not too hard.
A:	You know.
A:	But it's not enough to put you to sleep
B:	True,
B:	true.
A:	Which some of the songs on K V I L can.
B:	Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests.
B:	I mean
A:	Oh, yeah,
A:	got the bumper sticker, too?
B:	Oh, yes,
B:	oh, yes.
B:	You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
B:	and you know they're going to call you up.
A:	Someday.
B:	Yeah
B:	Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking.
B:	I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway.
A:	Okay.
B:	I appreciate it.
A:	Okay.
B:	Catch you later.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay
A:	Okay
B:	Have you done this very long?
A:	Uh, well, yeah,
A:	for the last, uh, couple of months.
B:	Yeah,
B:	that's the same with us.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, what kind of car would you buy?
A:	Well, it's kind of hard to say,
A:	uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years.
A:	We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	and, uh,
A:	wait a minute,
A:	we bought one in ninety.
A:	We've got three cars, of all things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan.
B:	Okay.
B:	What kind do you have now?
A:	Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,
A:	we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, of course, we look into the prices.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted
A:	because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time.
A:	Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	So, uh,
B:	And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
A:	Uh, yeah,
A:	yeah.
A:	We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,
A:	and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, they, they, uh,
A:	I've been extremely,
A:	we've had three Mazdas.
A:	We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah.
B:	We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, we, we've had, uh,
A:	let's see,
A:	we had, uh, we had a, uh,
A:	let me think.
A:	ause We had a fifty-three
A:	and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story
A:	Uh, and we had a sixty-five
A:	and then we had this eighty-two.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really.
B:	Yeah,
B:	we've been real pleased with ours.
B:	I think we've had, one, two, three
A:	Yeah.
B:	and most,
B:	we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
B:	and we've had the ninety-eight.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
B:	but I don't know,
B:	we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year
B:	and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I don't know what we're going to buy.
B:	I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,
B:	but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty
A:	Well
B:	So,
A:	uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years
A:	and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B
B:	Oh the,
A:	Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top.
B:	Ooh, boy.
A:	And, uh, I drove it mostly.
B:	I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
A:	And,
A:	Yeah,
A:	it really was.
A:	My husband was in the Air Force
A:	and we got transferred to Okinawa.
B:	Oh.
A:	So, uh, we had to sell it.
A:	which really tore me up
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Because, uh, it, it it was great fun.
A:	And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,
A:	we, uh, we decided that, uh,
A:	we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile
A:	and it, and it was just too big,
A:	so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States
A:	and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.
B:	Oh.
A:	So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
B:	Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They've got a lot of special needs
B:	and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have.
A:	Right,
A:	very definitely.
B:	And so you've got a real balance to make there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about you?
A:	Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old.
A:	They aren't really that old,
A:	but they are, sort of wearing out.
A:	My mamma is a dialysis patient
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she is only about sixty-four,
A:	but she's had some pretty close calls
A:	and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
A:	and so she's phasing out ounds like
A:	and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,
A:	but my daddy keeps talking about it.
A:	I don't,
A:	I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home.
B:	ery faint.
A:	And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home.
A:	He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now
B:	Oh really.
A:	and he's living by himself.
A:	My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	so but, he's, you know,
A:	as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home.
B:	Yeah,
B:	but it gets hard.
B:	My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	so she doesn't remember anybody
A:	Right.
B:	and, uh, she remembers things,
B:	but they are things back whenever she was real young
A:	Right.
B:	and so, with,
B:	she was living by herself
B:	but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's creating a lot of problems.
A:	Right,
A:	especially for your uncle I bet.
B:	Oh yes.
B:	Yes.
A:	Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.
A:	Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
B:	In Dallas,
B:	uh, yeah.
B:	I've, I've heard of several things
B:	and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,
B:	but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up.
A:	Right.
A:	So they are pretty limited.
B:	Right.
A:	Oh, another interesting thing,
A:	another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities.
B:	Oh really.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	uh-huh.
B:	Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know
B:	and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,
B:	but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
A:	Uh-huh ery faint.
A:	Right.
B:	and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
A:	Right
A:	to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities.
B:	Right.
B:	Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas.
B:	Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports.
A:	Right.
A:	Right.
B:	But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,
A:	That's true.
A:	You can't play those things.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you can't do it.
A:	But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times.
B:	Well, that's true.
A:	I guess, you know, you were talking about your,
A:	was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
B:	And they love to recollect.
B:	I mean they just, you know,
B:	and they will just go on and on with these stories
B:	and they have such a memory.
A:	Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?
B:	My grandmother doesn't
B:	She, she wants to to tell you about her story over again
B:	so
A:	Right.
B:	which is fine, you know,
B:	so,
A:	Well, that is good because we,
A:	Um, so what do you think?
B:	Um,
B:	I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.
B:	And so I saw some of the good
B:	and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care.
A:	Right.
B:	So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,
B:	I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life.
A:	Right.
B:	Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me
B:	because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see.
B:	One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Because it's treated as a disease.
B:	Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,
B:	but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability
B:	and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.
A:	Huh.
B:	Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,
B:	I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,
B:	I remember this one row of houses
B:	and they were, uh, row houses or townhouses, all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it would be lower middle-class housing here.
B:	It's probably middle-class housing there.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these
B:	and there was a doctor that lived in one of these.
B:	The one guy was a doctor
B:	and one was a taxi driver,
B:	and so their, their incomes were about the same.
A:	Huh.
B:	Whereas here, there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward.
A:	Right.
B:	And that, that didn't exist in Sweden.
A:	Right.
B:	And, uh, overall I their, their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower
B:	and it was, it was less professional
B:	and it was treated more, like a, like a taxi driver type job, then a, then a doctor type job.
A:	Yeah.
A:	that is, uh, that is something I've heard.
A:	Uh, I had a friend, uh, that I worked with that was from Sweden
A:	and that was, uh,
A:	probably the, the major concern I have is that, you know, we are leading in the technology realm of, of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to, to get into, uh, the medical field,
A:	but at the same time it's real hard.
A:	I mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance
A:	and so, you know, I'm real, you know,
A:	it's like well, you know, you know,
A:	there's got to be better ways, you know, to do some things
A:	but, you know, I hate to, uh,
A:	the, the competition, in a lot of ways is, is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor
A:	and, and, uh, they have to compete to be, to be good and to be knowledgeable.
A:	But at the same time, there's a, you know, they're regulating themselves
A:	and, and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for.
A:	My, I have a brother who's a vet
A:	and for something that he can get, you know, wholesale
A:	and I'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they, they, hospitals buy in such a bulk rate, um
B:	Right.
A:	you know, they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item
A:	and that's ridiculous.
A:	And I don't think that is, that is, uh, abnormal in any means to be doing things like that.
A:	And,
B:	You don't think it's abnormal?
A:	I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
B:	Oh, I see.
B:	You're not saying it's right,
B:	you're just saying it's common.
A:	yeah.
A:	And so it's, I think, to me I think, uh, something that's going to help our medical, uh, arena is for, um,
A:	and I don't know how to, I don't know how to do this
A:	but I think people are too lawsuit happy.
A:	And I mean things will happen
A:	and, and you've got to, uh, keep up
A:	or you've got to realize that, you know, it is just men or women that are, that are making, um, decisions
A:	and they will make mistakes
A:	and you know, if people, you know,
A:	there are some people that I'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it,
A:	but there are other things that just happen that you can't, you know, you can't say, you know, well, if you had just done this, you know, things would have done differently,
A:	and, um, I don't know.
A:	I, I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically. Um, in the, in the last number of years
B:	Yes.
A:	and I think that's something that if, if they could work on the cause of that and,
A:	it's, uh,
A:	I'll start off here.
A:	Uh, I don't know.
A:	I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N.
A:	Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,
A:	well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour
A:	but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
B:	Right,
B:	yeah.
A:	and, uh,
A:	but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,
B:	Yeah.
B:	I, I think I'd agree.
B:	A, a similar method of getting the news with me too.
B:	It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years.
B:	Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature
B:	and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I know, the,
A:	my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.
A:	Uh,
B:	That, that's true, you know.
B:	You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries.
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.
A:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything
A:	and, uh, it's amazing that,
A:	you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,
A:	I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, you know.
B:	I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas
B:	and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>.
B:	You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,
B:	uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,
B:	and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand.
B:	And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.
A:	Yeah,
A:	definitely.
B:	You just don't know what's going on.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I'd, I,
B:	every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas
B:	and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C
B:	and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too.
B:	You you can tune into some stations
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.
B:	Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area
B:	and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.
B:	There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.
B:	I hadn't really thought about it
B:	but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.
A:	Right.
A:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.
A:	Uh, well part of it, touring.
A:	And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on.
A:	There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I had never heard any of that before.
B:	Yeah,
B:	you know, there was, a, a,
B:	what is it called,
B:	is it Meech Lake Accord?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of
B:	and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.
B:	And, and came
B:	it was a big thing going on there
B:	and I came back here
B:	and nothing in the papers.
A:	Right,
A:	right.
B:	I didn't see a thing about it.
B:	So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess.
B:	It's improved.
B:	And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.
B:	Even, even there's, uh, uh,
B:	it's it's semireligious in some respects.
B:	But what is it?
B:	It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,
B:	uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.
B:	The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh, I, it surprised me.
B:	I've caught it a few times
B:	and they, they do some pretty good news.
B:	Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.
B:	Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You'd think it would carry mostly religious
B:	but it, it doesn't seem to.
B:	So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.
B:	Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries.
B:	But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.
A:	I used to get the, uh,
A:	A, uh, Golden Retriever.
B:	Ooh, that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs.
A:	Yeah.
A:	Is it really?
B:	How long have you had it?
A:	We've had him for,
A:	let's see, he just had his fourth birthday.
B:	Fourth birthday.
A:	Yeah,
A:	and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
A:	and, uh, he's pretty okay,
A:	we like him.
B:	Does he shed a lot?
A:	He does.
A:	That's the one thing we don't like about him.
A:	In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.
A:	He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
B:	How much does he weigh now?
A:	He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,
A:	and they put him on the scale
A:	and he's up to ninety four now.
B:	Oh.
A:	But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever.
A:	He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier.
B:	Um.
A:	But,
B:	Is he good with family?
A:	He is.
A:	It's, uh, just me and my wife
A:	and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids.
A:	We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
B:	Yeah,
B:	I can understand that
A:	Because I,
A:	Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How about you?
B:	Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old.
A:	Oh.
B:	And he's our spoiled child right now, too
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he also sheds a lot.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday.
B:	But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog
A:	That's probably a good idea.
A:	They're good though.
A:	Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?
B:	No,
B:	but my husband had one when he was growing up.
A:	Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs.
A:	They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.
A:	They like to play.
B:	Um.
A:	Especially with the kids.
A:	They love to play with kids.
B:	Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?
A:	No,
A:	he's pretty much an inside dog.
B:	Um.
A:	He stays in.
A:	We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much
A:	and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	He's really a wimp.
A:	And when it comes to being alone,
A:	uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,
A:	but he does not like to be tied outside.
A:	He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark.
B:	Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?
A:	No,
A:	he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well
A:	and, uh, he knows where our yard is
A:	and we have a pretty small yard,
A:	but he seems to know the boundaries.
B:	Um.
A:	And he usually is good about staying within them,
A:	although our next door neighbors have a dog, too
A:	and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog.
B:	Oh, yeah?
A:	And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
A:	but, he's pretty good.
A:	He stays out of the street
A:	and, uh, if I catch him I call him
A:	and he comes back.
A:	So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things.
B:	Um.
B:	Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
A:	No
A:	we never did.
B:	and,
A:	I, I trained him on my own
A:	and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,
A:	but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,
A:	so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,
A:	but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well.
A:	I never really to hit him or anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things.
B:	Huh.
B:	Really?
A:	I, I see other people out there
A:	and they hit their dogs and try to,
A:	and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,
A:	least I,
B:	Invisible what?
A:	Invisible fencing,
A:	have you heard of that?
B:	No,
B:	what is that?
A:	It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
B:	Oh.
A:	and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
A:	and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them.
B:	Oh.
B:	Boy.
A:	Yeah
B:	I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
A:	Yeah,
A:	well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog
A:	and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
A:	so he held on to the collar
A:	and he walked out to the perimeter.
A:	He said it was a good jolt.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah,
A:	and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques.
B:	Um.
A:	I don't think they're always necessary.
A:	If you put enough patience into,
B:	Yeah,
B:	just be consistent and diligent with it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, um,
A:	It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?
B:	Yeah
B:	he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months.
A:	Somebody just told me that
B:	Yeah.
A:	because of the leukemia?
B:	Yeah,
B:	that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up.
B:	And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
A:	Wow.
B:	So,
A:	Quite a difference.
B:	Yeah.
A:	What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?
B:	Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently
B:	so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area
B:	and it's very very nice
A:	Oh.
B:	and,
A:	The only experience I have,
A:	I don't have any children
A:	but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school.
A:	And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked.
A:	And I just, uh ...
B:	<talking> Yeah.
B:	That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit.
A:	Is it? ery faint.
B:	But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.
B:	Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	The expense.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock
B:	or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Which is understandable.
B:	I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late
A:	Just sit around
A:	That that's true.
B:	but
A:	See the lady I did it for,
A:	that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.
A:	So she could sleep in.
A:	And, uh, then she could be at home
A:	and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
A:	But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour
A:	and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents
A:	and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
B:	Oh, no.
B:	Yeah.
B:	It's hardly worth your time.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's pretty bad.
B:	The only time I baby-sat was in high school
B:	and it, you know,
B:	of course you don't
B:	I didn't pay taxes on that,
B:	so.
A:	Right.
B:	It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,
B:	it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
B:	and I'd just go over there.
B:	Every Thursday night, they went to the theater.
B:	They had permanent tickets
B:	and they'd give me,
B:	it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,
B:	but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	And, I mean, they'd, you know,
B:	it was great.
B:	I'd go over there
B:	and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here.
B:	Watch, whatever you want.
B:	And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard.
B:	And there's some Coke
B:	and you know, just help yourself to anything.
B:	So it was, it was, you know, the best,
A:	Wow.
B:	that was a long time ago
B:	and that was only for a few years.
B:	Just once a week.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I don't know.
A:	I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's true.
A:	And they stick around for longer.
A:	Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it.
A:	And I quit you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I really liked the little girl and everything
A:	but I thought ...
B:	She does take up,
B:	and they do take up a lot of your time.
B:	That ...
A:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I ...
B:	They're very demanding
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, and she was really spoiled.
A:	They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
A:	So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch.
A:	And the mom was a dentist
A:	and I was just like, we've got to quit this.
A:	And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
A:	But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
B:	Oh, shoot.
B:	My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything.
A:	Eat this or <laughter>.
B:	That's right.
A:	So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Because some,
A:	I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
B:	I think,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And just have like at the most, like ten kids.
B:	And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
A:	No.
B:	Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
A:	That's true.
A:	I, I'd love to do it.
A:	But I just don't trust people now.
A:	There's too many lawsuits.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...
B:	More than what it's worth?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It would scare me.
A:	With,
A:	I don't know,
A:	cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
A:	but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent
A:	and they get happy about money
A:	and they just want to sue you.
B:	Yeah.
B:	Well, yeah.
B:	That's,
B:	yeah,
B:	exactly.
B:	When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And that's just, you know,
B:	you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
A:	That's impossible.
B:	You know, you never know what they're going to get into.
A:	I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
A:	and she takes her little girl with her
A:	and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire
A:	and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
A:	And that's the people that are working there, you know.
A:	And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know.
B:	Oh, that's horrible.
A:	Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper.
B:	Huh.
A:	You know, just awful things.
A:	And so I don't know.
A:	I don't have kids
A:	but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
A:	I mean, you just don't know.
B:	Yeah.
B:	That's
B:	yeah,
B:	that's a hard thing about it.
B:	If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married
B:	but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work.
B:	I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either.
B:	Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	That's true.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.
A:	It would just rip me apart, I think
A:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Just not knowing.
B:	Yeah,
B:	just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait.
A:	What do you usually wear to,
B:	Well, let's see.
B:	It turns out that, uh,
B:	I work at TEKTRONIX
B:	and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You just wear, uh,
B:	let's see.
B:	When I first came here, I wore suits
B:	but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important.
B:	I'm an engineer.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's nice comfortable stuff.
B:	Yes.
B:	Open shirt, open at the neck, you know, no tie.
A:	Wow.
B:	And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis.
A:	Wow.
A:	That's nice.
B:	Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?
A:	Well actually right now I'm a full time college student
A:	so my dress code is very, very (( )).
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah,
A:	I usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime.
A:	But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's so,
A:	generally then I dress, you know, nicer.
A:	Usually nice summer slacks or more, sometimes skirts, stuff like that.
A:	So, then it's still, you know, the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of office
A:	but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
B:	Yes.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah,
B:	well I, uh, I just recently applied for a different job in the company here
B:	and so I decided well I'd wear a suit.
A:	Oh, really.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it, it was very interesting,
B:	uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits.
B:	Uh, most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual, almost the same clothes that, that you'd wear to school.
A:	Wow.
A:	That must be nice atmosphere then.
B:	Well, it has been.
B:	Although the new president and C E O of the company is from a much more formal eastern, uh, background.
A:	Oh.
B:	And so the result is that, uh,
B:	so anyway I wore this suit
B:	and I went over to, uh, uh, to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it, and I, I was almost converted because, uh, the effect of that suit on the way people reacted and responded to me as opposed to the,
B:	uh, just to kind of,
B:	how shall I say it,
B:	they know you're there
B:	but they don't
B:	uh, you don't,
B:	there's no notice at all.
B:	But when I wore a suit that day, uh, it was obvious that people didn't know whether I was a worker bee or a manager.
A:	Wow.
B:	So people, uh, how shall I say it, made a, made much more effort to notice you, acknowledge your presence, say hello and, uh, things like that,
B:	so.
A:	That's interesting.
A:	It's like a mini, little study there
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's really interesting.
B:	And so this dress for success thing, I think is, uh,
B:	by and large I've, I'm kind of, uh, convinced that, uh, by that, just that one, uh, uh, experience and then having talked to several other people that, that, uh, unless you're in a, an environment where they're going to make fun of, of, of better clothes, that better clothes always pay off.
A:	Right.
A:	Huh.
A:	That's interesting.
B:	Doesn't mean they have to be, uh,
B:	how shall I say it,
B:	they don't have to be the, the most, uh, the absolute best
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, a little dressing a little bit above the standard, I think, would, uh, pay off
B:	so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.
A:	<Laughter> That's neat,
A:	that's neat
B:	And, uh, I, I don't know,
B:	now I, I know eastern,
B:	now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate.
B:	We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime
B:	and it can be quite warm in the summertime.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Not hot like, uh,
B:	I lived in the midwest for a while.
A:	Oh.
B:	And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	We don't have that much.
B:	It's, uh, it's a very mild climate.
A:	Oh, well that's nice.
A:	That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine.
B:	Yes,
B:	it is.
A:	Because here, gosh, we had, uh,
A:	the winter hasn't been bad this winter.
A:	It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice
A:	but it's been cold.
A:	Low twenties, let's say,
A:	and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties
A:	so,
A:	You interested in woodworking?
B:	Yeah.
B:	Actually, I, uh, I guess I am
B:	Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion.
B:	Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself
B:	Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son.
A:	Um. What kind of
B:	It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess.
A:	pine?
B:	But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
B:	and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,
B:	the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard
A:	Uh-huh.
A:	I guess he's young.
B:	and then,
B:	yes
B:	He's about five and a half years old.
A:	Oh, he'll be delighted.
B:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Now I just have to finish it though.
B:	I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work
B:	and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,
B:	because I've got it all cut out,
B:	it's all, uh,
B:	I've done most of the coloring
B:	but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
A:	Did you do it with a jigsaw
A:	or do you have powered, you know, a,
B:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it.
A:	Um.
B:	So yeah.
B:	to do the, uh, the turn cut.
B:	Uh, how about yourself?
A:	Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking.
A:	I don't have lots of tools.
A:	Our local schools have adult education in the evening
B:	Oh.
A:	uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance.
A:	I'm an artist.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	And I'm very handy
A:	and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually.
B:	That's great.
B:	What, what type of art do you focus on?
A:	I have a Master's degree
A:	and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,
A:	but I'm really interested in the crafts.
B:	Huh.
A:	I make stain glass.
A:	I've done some silver jewelry making
A:	and I kind of,
A:	once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else
B:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of jack of all trades, master of none.
A:	Yeah,
A:	well no,
A:	actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,
A:	you didn't buy it,
A:	you made it.
B:	That's great!
A:	And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone
A:	so let's do something else.
B:	Right.
B:	You want to, uh, explore a new field
B:	or, or,
A:	Well, yeah,
A:	I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet
B:	Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?
A:	but,
A:	Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art
A:	and it's in art education.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, I'm a licensed teacher
A:	but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that way I have time for my kids too.
A:	And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.
A:	I don't know how long that's going to last
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, uh, they're cutting back,
A:	so I don't go in all that often
A:	but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things.
A:	Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
A:	and I say, oh no
A:	and , and I go
A:	and I make it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's how I started jewelry making.
A:	I, I love to cook.
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff
A:	and I went
A:	and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you
A:	and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
B:	Exactly.
A:	And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
A:	It took me a lot of time
A:	but  it didn't,
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,
A:	and then I,
B:	And your time,
B:	then you're that much farther ahead
A:	Yeah.
A:	Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.
A:	It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
B:	Right.
B:	I've seen them
B:	and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in
B:	and,
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's neat.
A:	I went there,
A:	we have Home Depot out here.
A:	I don't know if you've heard of it.
A:	I went
A:	and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
B:	Yes.
B:	We have one.
A:	I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
A:	and cutting that wedge out was no joke
B:	Huh.
B:	Oh, I'm, I'm sure.
A:	We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.
B:	A band saw?
B:	What?
A:	I did it through Adult Ed again.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And the teacher was one of these negative people,
A:	oh that's dangerous,
A:	we can't do that,
A:	we just can't do that.
A:	And I'm going well how about this way?
A:	I, I want to do that,
A:	that was the plan here
B:	Right.
A:	So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
B:	A cradle for it.
B:	Yeah,
B:	so you can steady it
B:	and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?
A:	Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw
A:	but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that
B:	Right,
B:	right.
A:	and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.
A:	I said I'm not that steady,
A:	it's not going to happen.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So we built a cradle for it
A:	and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,
A:	by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
B:	Right.
A:	So,
B:	Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?
A:	Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.
A:	You know
B:	Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log
B:	and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,
B:	it's, uh,
B:	if you're looking at adding on you have,
A:	Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution.
A:	I think Grand Rapids was number one.
A:	Uh, we really don't have too much of a problem as far as, uh, industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here.
A:	But we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have
A:	and that is the effects of acid rain. coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.
B:	Right.
B:	Well, that's true.
B:	Actually down here we don't have a big problem with, uh, with air pollution.
B:	Mainly because we don't have anybody to to either side of us.
B:	Uh, which helps out a lot as far as that goes.
B:	I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in, uh, you know,
B:	debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and, you know, in that area over, uh, air pollution
B:	and their attitude's, basically, well, prevailing ins, winds are to the east
B:	so why should we have to worry.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I've, I've, uh, was in Los Angeles once
A:	and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes.
A:	I mean you couldn't really see that much
A:	Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions
B:	Oh, yes
B:	nothing,
A:	and then it gets hazy around here
A:	but they're really,
A:	we don't have a big problem with it.
A:	I think that, uh, what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is,
A:	it's, it's the, uh, ongoing acid rain problem.
A:	Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas where, you know, the lakes are becoming, uh, changing the acidity of the lakes
A:	and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.
B:	Right.
A:	And I know that there's been battles over the states up here.
A:	Uh, you know, Governor Mario going after, you know, governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there.
A:	I remember when I was in Florida,
A:	the only problem was that it seemed like it may,
A:	it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>.
B:	Oh absolutely,
B:	yeah,
B:	just muggy.
B:	So, yes
B:	I think,
B:	yeah,
B:	I think you're right.
B:	Our most pollute substance down here is just water.
B:	But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place.
A:	Yeah
A:	it,
B:	You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those
B:	and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around.
A:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I, you know, I was in Boston once
A:	and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee.
A:	Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing
B:	Absolutely.
A:	and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.
A:	I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,
A:	I think that's biggest problem
A:	because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.
B:	Right.
A:	And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really.
A:	Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help
A:	but if you have nowhere to do anything.
B:	That's, that's very true.
B:	Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere.
B:	But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,
B:	you've got that,
B:	and you got the cars.
B:	I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean.
A:	Yeah.
A:	I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,
A:	but I, I, uh, you know,
A:	Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,
A:	but, you know, up here we have Kodak
B:	Right.
A:	and that's the worst polluter.
A:	They put, uh, uh,
A:	you can smell ether in the air sometimes
A:	It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
B:	I guess so.
A:	Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras
A:	and they, they make film here
A:	and they're the worst offender
A:	but it's, you know, it's under so much control.
A:	You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them
A:	but that's really getting under control now.
B:	Right.
B:	I, you know, I don't know in air what they do.
B:	Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about.
B:	Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,
B:	my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas
B:	and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there
B:	and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air.
B:	I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,
B:	there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad.
A:	Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,
